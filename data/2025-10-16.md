### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SimULi, a real-time, multi-sensor renderer for autonomous driving that supports arbitrary camera models and LiDAR, extending 3DGUT with tiling and Gaussian representations to improve cross-sensor consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity, real-time simulation for autonomous robots requiring diverse sensor modalities (cameras with distortion, LiDAR) to safely test in simulation beyond real-world data collection.

Method: Extend 3DGUT to support LiDAR via automated tiling for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling; implement a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy to align multi-sensor data and reduce cross-modality errors.

Result: SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based methods; reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods; achieves comparable or superior fidelity to state-of-the-art on autonomous driving benchmarks across camera and LiDAR metrics.

Conclusion: SimULi enables high-fidelity, real-time multi-sensor simulation for autonomous driving with diverse camera models and LiDAR, addressing speed and cross-sensor consistency limitations of prior neural rendering approaches.

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for surgical future prediction (SurgFUTR) reframes forecasting as state-change learning using a teacher-student model, with state representations from Sinkhorn clustering, enabling short-term and long-term predictions across datasets and procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical AI largely predicts or understands isolated tasks and coarse observations, lacking unified, generalizable methods for short- and long-horizon future events. Real-time surgical forecasting could improve safety, resource allocation, and early complication warnings, but cross-procedure generalization and fine-grained supervision remain challenges.

Method: SurgFUTR uses a state-change paradigm: classify transitions between current and future states. A teacher network learns from current and future clips; a student predicts future states from the current video, guided by the Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. Video clips are compressed into state representations via Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering. The approach is evaluated on SFPBench, with five tasks covering short-term (action triplets, events) and long-term (remaining duration, phase/step transitions) horizons. Experiments span four datasets and three procedures, with cross-procedure transfer tests.

Result: The method yields consistent improvements across four datasets and three procedures, and cross-procedure transfer demonstrates generalizability of the approach to unseen procedures.

Conclusion: Reframing surgical future prediction as state-change learning with a teacher-student architecture and discrete state representations enables unified, transferable forecasting across short- and long-horizon tasks, paving the way for real-time, generalizable intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A metric-learning framework (TMPS) using targeted, prioritized sampling leverages a small number of labeled target-domain samples to improve robustness of plant-disease diagnosis across diverse field conditions; it outperforms source-only and naive fine-tuning methods on a large, multi-field dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness gap caused by domain shifts between training (source) data and deployment (target) conditions in plant disease diagnosis, especially when labeled target data is scarce.

Method: Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS) is a metric-learning framework that incorporates limited labeled target-domain samples during training via prioritized sampling to create a discriminative embedding that remains robust across domain variations.

Result: On a large-scale leaf-disease dataset (223,073 images, 23 fields, 21 diseases, 3 crops), using only 10 target-domain samples per disease yielded TMPS improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 macro-F1 points over two strong baselines (same combined data and fine-tuned models), and 18.7 and 17.1 points over the baseline and conventional metric learning.

Conclusion: TMPS demonstrates that minimal, strategically selected target-domain supervision can substantially boost deployment robustness in plant-disease diagnosis, offering a simple and effective approach to mitigating domain gaps in practical settings.

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer enables zero-label learning for image captioning by aligning vision-language representations during training, allowing existing VLMs to produce grounded captions without text labels or full retraining, demonstrated with qualitative improvements on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled image datasets limit scalability and leave unlabeled data untapped; zero-label adaptation can leverage unlabeled data to improve VLMs.

Method: Unified Vision-Language Alignment (ViZer) during training that actively aligns vision and language representation features; enhances existing VLMs without requiring text labels or full model retraining.

Result: Qualitative improvements: captions become more grounded and descriptive; automated metrics may penalize absent details, but ViZer yields better grounding; observed consistently on two base models.

Conclusion: ViZer offers a practical starting point for zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks by enabling improved captions using unlabeled data and without full retraining.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)
*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind is a fetal ultrasound–specific vision-language system using Salient Epistemic Disentanglement and a large-scale fetal ultrasound report dataset to improve report generation and diagnostic accuracy across gestational stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical V-L models adapted from adult imaging underperform on fetal ultrasound due to multi-view reasoning, disease variability, and data scarcity; a clinically aligned, scalable solution is needed.

Method: Introduce Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED) that injects an expert-curated bipartite graph to decouple view-disease associations and guide reinforcement-learning–driven preference selection; train on FetalSigma-1M (20k reports from 12 centers) for scalable data; apply to both report generation and diagnosis.

Result: Outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across gestational stages; about 14% average gains; 61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions; efficient, stable, scalable.

Conclusion: SED aligns inference with obstetric practice, reduces learning bottlenecks due to view and disease heterogeneity, and enables scalable fetal ultrasound AI; dataset and model support broader clinical adoption.

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5: a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion; ZeResFDG unifies frequency-aware guidance, energy rescaling, and zero-projection; spectral EMA with hysteresis toggles between conservative and detail-seeking modes; training-free QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer improves robustness and micro-texture with negligible overhead; compatible with other parameterizations; no retraining required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address limitations in existing guidance methods for latent diffusion sampling: need sharper outputs, better prompt adherence, fewer artifacts, without retraining; enable per-sample dynamics and high-frequency texture at high resolutions.

Method: introduce ZeResFDG module with three parts: frequency-decoupled guidance, energy rescaling, zero-projection; add spectral EMA with hysteresis between conservative and detail modes; introduce QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection) for inference-time robustness; discuss compatibility with alternative parameterizations; evaluate across SD/SDXL samplers; maintain moderate guidance scales.

Result: Improved sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control across SD/SDXL samplers at moderate guidance scales without retraining; robustness and high-frequency micro-texture obtained with negligible overhead; stable across resolutions; compatible with alternative parameterizations (velocity) but focus on latent diffusion.

Conclusion: CADE 2.5 provides a training-free, inference-time enhancement to sampling quality and robustness, enabling better control over high-frequency details and prompt fidelity in SD/SDXL without retraining; the proposed components are modular and broadly compatible.

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

### [7] [Scope: Selective Cross-modal Orchestration of Visual Perception Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974)
*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a Mixture-of-Encoders framework that dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image–text pair via instance-level routing, achieving better performance with less compute than aggregating all encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome diminishing returns and high compute from naïvely stacking multiple vision encoders in vision-language models by using intelligent, instance-level encoder selection.

Method: Maintain a shared encoder plus a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder for each image–text pair. Train the router with dual entropy regularization and auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load and per-instance routing confidence.

Result: With one shared plus one routed encoder, the model outperforms configurations using four additional encoders while reducing compute by 24–49%.

Conclusion: Intelligent encoder selection via a MoEnc framework can surpass brute-force multi-encoder aggregation in VLMs, challenging the current paradigm of simply stacking more encoders.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

### [8] [SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016)
*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SVAG task and benchmark to jointly detect, track, and temporally localize objects described by actions in video, with a baseline (SVAGFormer) and evaluation toolkit (SVAGEval); reveals gaps in current models for fine-grained, multi-object action grounding in long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between coarse action recognition and generic tracking by requiring simultaneous spatial-temporal grounding of actions described in natural language across multiple objects in video.

Method: Defines Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG) as a new task. Builds SVAG-Bench dataset (688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, 903 verbs). Proposes SVAGFormer baseline adapting state-of-the-art vision-language models for joint spatial-temporal grounding. Provides SVAGEval toolkit for standardized evaluation.

Result: Empirical results show current models perform poorly on SVAG, especially in dense or complex scenes, indicating the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Conclusion: Introduces a challenging new benchmark and baseline framework to drive progress in joint action-grounded perception, with implications for embodied AI, autonomous systems, and human-AI interaction; highlights the need for models capable of interpreting fine-grained, multi-object action descriptions over time.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

### [9] [SeqBench: Benchmarking Sequential Narrative Generation in Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13042)
*Zhengxu Tang,Zizheng Wang,Luning Wang,Zitao Shuai,Chenhao Zhang,Siyu Qian,Yirui Wu,Bohao Wang,Haosong Rao,Zhenyu Yang,Chenwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in text-to-video generation, featuring a 320-prompt dataset with 2,560 human-annotated videos from 8 models and a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG) metric that aligns well with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V benchmarks focus on visual quality and fail to assess long-range narrative coherence and object-state consistency across sequences; a systematic framework is needed to evaluate and guide improvements in sequential reasoning.

Method: Develop SeqBench dataset (320 prompts across narrative complexities) and generate 2,560 videos using 8 state-of-the-art T2V models; design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG) based automatic metric to capture long-range temporal dependencies and ordering; validate DTG against human annotations.

Result: DTG metric shows strong correlation with human judgments; SeqBench reveals critical model limitations in maintaining object states across multi-action sequences, physical plausibility in multi-object scenes, and accurate timing/order of sequential actions; provides a first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V.

Conclusion: SeqBench establishes the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in text-to-video, enabling targeted improvements in sequential reasoning; the dataset and DTG metric offer concrete insights for future model development; see the project page for details.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

### [10] [SceneAdapt: Scene-aware Adaptation of Human Motion Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13044)
*Jungbin Cho,Minsu Kim,Jisoo Kim,Ce Zheng,Laszlo A. Jeni,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Youngjae Yu,Seonjoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by bridging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets through two-stage adaptation (inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening) using a proxy motion inbetweening task and cross-attention-based scene conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation methods treat motion semantics and scene awareness separately, lacking large-scale paired data with rich text, motion, and scene interactions. A method that leverages disjoint datasets to endow text-to-motion models with scene awareness is needed.

Method: Two-stage adaptation. Stage 1 introduces keyframing layers to modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold, enabling a text-free proxy task. Stage 2 adds a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. The approach uses disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets, with motion inbetweening as a bridge between them to inject scene-awareness into text-to-motion models.

Result: Experiments show SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models. Analyses reveal how the mechanism of scene understanding emerges, and the authors plan to release code and models.

Conclusion: SceneAdapt demonstrates that scene-awareness can be transferred to text-to-motion models via a two-stage adaptation framework that leverages proxy inbetweening and scene-conditioned cross-attention, offering a scalable path to scene-aware motion generation.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

*Huawei Jiang,Husna Mutahira,Gan Huang,Mannan Saeed Muhammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN+Mamba state-space model for 12-lead ECG classification improves AUPRC/AUROC on PhysioNet Challenges, showing strong potential for reliable, accessible ECG diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models (CNNs, transformers) struggle with long ECG sequences; efficient sequence modeling is needed. Mamba, a selective state-space model, offers scalable temporal dependency capture, potentially improving ECG classification and enabling telemedicine in resource-limited settings.

Method: A One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Ecg Mamba (ODCNN-ECG-Mamba) framework that combines CNN-based feature extraction with Mamba, using Vision Mamba as a bidirectional variant to enhance temporal dependency modeling. Evaluated on PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges 2020 and 2021 across 12-lead ECG data.

Result: The proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC scores than the best previously published algorithms on twelve-lead ECGs, outperforming existing methods in PhysioNet challenges.

Conclusion: Mamba-based architectures are a promising direction for reliable ECG classification, supporting early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transferability of pose representations across scenes is the key to true novel view synthesis (NVS); XFactor is a geometry-free, self-supervised model that achieves transferable latent poses without 3D priors, introduces a transferability metric, and outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify a robust criterion for true NVS by requiring that pose representations transfer between different video sequences and scenes; prior self-supervised NVS methods fail to transfer poses across scenes.

Method: XFactor uses pair-wise pose estimation with an input/output augmentation scheme to disentangle camera pose from scene content, enabling geometric reasoning. It employs unconstrained latent pose variables with no explicit SE(3) parameterization or 3D inductive biases. A new transferability metric is introduced. Large-scale experiments and probing show latent poses correlate with real-world poses.

Result: XFactor achieves transferability in a geometry-free setting, outperforming prior pose-free NVS transformers; latent poses show strong correlation with real-world poses in probing experiments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that true NVS transferability is achievable without explicit 3D geometry by learning transferable latent pose representations and a proper augmentation strategy, backed by a novel transferability metric.

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

### [13] [Direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared and visible image fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13067)
*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss for infrared–visible image fusion that separately supervises horizontal and vertical gradients with sign preservation to improve edge fidelity without changing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based supervision often collapses gradients to magnitude, losing directional information and yielding ambiguous guidance and weaker edges.

Method: Introduce an axis-wise gradient loss that treats horizontal and vertical gradients separately, preserves their sign, and enforces these cues across multiple scales, all without altering model architectures or training protocols.

Result: Empirical results on open-source models and multiple benchmarks show sharper, better-aligned edges and richer texture preservation.

Conclusion: Directional, sign-preserving gradient supervision across scales improves fusion quality without architectural changes.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised domain adaptation for cross-domain MRI hippocampus segmentation using style harmonisation and bidirectional deformable image registration, jointly trained with segmentation and adversarial guidance to align content and appearance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation models suffer from domain shifts across datasets due to differences in image appearance (style) and population-specific anatomy (content); robust cross-domain performance is essential for clinical deployment.

Method: Combine z-normalisation style harmonisation with a bidirectional deformable image registration network. Train the DIR jointly with a segmentation network and a discriminator, guiding anatomically plausible transformations focused on the region of interest to align source images to the target domain.

Result: Validated on Morph-MNIST for core principle validation and on three MRI datasets with varying atrophy. The method outperforms baselines across experiments, achieving up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score when transferring from young healthy to dementia patients, with the largest gains under substantial content shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shifts in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation, offering accurate segmentation across diverse populations by jointly harmonising style and content through a content-aware DIR with adversarial guidance.

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

### [15] [Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13080)
*Shuai Fu,Jian Zhou,Qi Chen,Huang Jing,Huy Anh Nguyen,Xiaohan Liu,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma,Quanshi Zhang,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to quantify counting hallucinations in diffusion models. Introduces CountHalluSet (ToyShape, SimObject, RealHand) and an evaluation protocol to study how sampling choices affect counting errors. Finds FID poorly reflects counting hallucinations; aims to guide design of factually constrained generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often generate counting errors (e.g., wrong number of objects). There is no standardized way to quantify such hallucinations, hindering progress toward models that respect real-world facts.

Method: Create CountHalluSet with clear counting criteria (ToyShape, SimObject, RealHand) and a standardized evaluation protocol. Systematically assess how diffusion-sampling factors (solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, initial noise) influence counting hallucinations and examine their correlation with FID and other metrics.

Result: Counting hallucinations vary with sampling settings. FID does not consistently capture counting errors. CountHalluSet provides a benchmark and protocol, enabling incremental progress in quantifying and mitigating counting hallucinations in diffusion models.

Conclusion: This work establishes a first step toward systematic quantification of counting hallucinations in diffusion models and offers insights to guide future research on designing factual-constrained generative systems.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

### [16] [Edit-Your-Interest: Efficient Video Editing via Feature Most-Similar Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13084)
*Yi Zuo,Zitao Wang,Lingling Li,Xu Liu,Fang Liu,Licheng Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, zero-shot video editing method using a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory and Most-Similar Propagation to cache and propagate features across frames, with cross-attention-based masks; achieves higher efficiency and better visual fidelity than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I-based video editing methods incur high computational/memory costs and degrade temporal consistency and fidelity, limiting practical use.

Method: Introduce Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory (SFM) to cache salient image tokens from spatial attention; propose Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) to transfer relevant tokens across frames; include an SFM update algorithm to refresh cached features; extract instance masks via cross-attention maps and integrate them into diffusion denoising for fine-grained edits.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest provides a practical, zero-shot video editing solution that maintains background integrity while enabling precise object edits with reduced computational load and improved temporal consistency.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

### [17] [EgoSocial: Benchmarking Proactive Intervention Ability of Omnimodal LLMs via Egocentric Social Interaction Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13105)
*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces EgoSocial dataset and EgoSoD method to improve intervention timing in egocentric social perception; demonstrates current omnimodal LLMs lag in recognizing when to intervene and how to assess social cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AR/VR becomes part of daily life, AI assistants must understand and appropriately intervene in social interactions from an egocentric perspective; current LLMs often respond in socially inappropriate ways, disrupting conversation and user focus.

Method: Create EgoSocial, a large-scale dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs to benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. Analyze omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) for social cue detection. Propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method that fuses multimodal cues (audio, video) into a social thinking graph to model participants/interactions and predict optimal intervention timing and social interactions.

Result: OLLMs perform poorly at intervention timing (e.g., 14.4% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). EgoSoD improves Intervention Timing Phi-4 by 45.6% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9%, and improves overall Social Interaction Phi-4 by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9%. Dataset and code will be released.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable egocentric benchmark and an end-to-end method that enhances AI social intervention decisions, with substantial performance gains on timing and social interaction metrics; dataset/code release planned.

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

### [18] [DriveCritic: Towards Context-Aware, Human-Aligned Evaluation for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13108)
*Jingyu Song,Zhenxin Li,Shiyi Lan,Xinglong Sun,Nadine Chang,Maying Shen,Joshua Chen,Katherine A. Skinner,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveCritic proposes a context-aware, human-aligned evaluation for autonomous driving planners by introducing the DriveCritic dataset (contextual, pairwise human preferences) and DriveCritic model (a Vision-Language Model fine-tuned via supervised and RL) to judge trajectory pairs. It outperforms existing metrics like EPDMS in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving metrics (e.g., EPDMS) lack context awareness and nuanced judgment in challenging scenarios, leading to misalignment with human preferences. There is a need for a dataset and model that capture context and human judgments.

Method: 1) Construct DriveCritic dataset with challenging scenarios annotated with pairwise human preferences. 2) Develop DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model evaluated on trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. 3) Train with a two-stage pipeline: supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning to align model judgments with human preferences.

Result: DriveCritic substantially outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and exhibits strong context awareness, indicating more reliable alignment with human judgments for autonomous driving evaluation.

Conclusion: Incorporating context-rich data and human preferences yields a more reliable, human-aligned framework for evaluating autonomous driving systems, addressing limitations of context-agnostic metrics like EPDMS.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

### [19] [VPREG: An Optimal Control Formulation for Diffeomorphic Image Registration Based on the Variational Principle Grid Generation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13109)
*Zicong Zhou,Baihan Zhao,Andreas Mang,Guojun Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPreg is a diffeomorphic image registration framework that enforces positive Jacobians and an accurate inverse by using a Variational Principle (VP) grid, achieving superior Dice scores and inverse consistency on OASIS-1 vs ANTs-SyN, FreeSurfer-Easyreg, FSL-Fnirt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In neuroimaging, registration must be accurate yet topologically valid; existing methods sometimes yield non-diffeomorphic transformations or weak inverses; reliable inverse maps are crucial for many workflows.

Method: Introduces VPreg with VP-based grid generation that constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl; yields diffeomorphic spatial transformations; computes an accurate inverse within diffeomorphism group; evaluates on 150 registrations from OASIS-1; compares Dice across 35 ROIs with baselines.

Result: VPreg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Dice, transformation regularity, and inverse accuracy/consistency; outperforms ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, FSL-Fnirt.

Conclusion: VPreg demonstrates that diffeomorphic registration with VP-generated grids can achieve high accuracy while preserving topological guarantees and providing a reliable inverse map, beneficial for computational anatomy and morphometry.

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter) to bridge text-image entropy gap using LLM-driven text expansion and hypergraph-based cross-modal connections, achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on Flickr30K and MS-COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address imbalance in cross-modal retrieval caused by differing information entropy between text and image modalities; leverage open semantic knowledge from LLMs and a hypergraph adapter to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) a prompt template that uses an LLM to enrich the text's polysemy without domain-specific knowledge, increasing text entropy relative to visuals; 2) a hypergraph adapter to form multilateral connections between text and image in a shared embedding space, correcting positive/negative matching for synonymous semantics and reducing noise by mapping reduced dimensions back to original dimensions.

Result: 16.8% gains in text-to-image and 40.1% gains in image-to-text cross-modal retrieval on Flickr30K and MS-COCO; achieves new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Entropy-enhanced alignment via LLM-driven description and hypergraph connectivity yields substantial improvements in cross-modal semantic alignment and retrieval performance.

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

TL;DR: 3D CNNs outperform LSTMs in ASL recognition accuracy (92.4% vs 86.7%) but incur higher per-frame latency; a hybrid 3D CNN-LSTM is also explored. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy and real-time efficiency for edge-ready ASL recognition, guiding architecture choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how spatiotemporal feature extractors (3D CNNs) compare with temporal sequence models (LSTMs) for real-time ASL recognition, and to provide benchmarks for edge-deployed assistive technologies.

Method: Dataset of 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes was used to compare three architectures—3D CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid 3D CNN-LSTM—under similar training conditions. Metrics included recognition accuracy, computational efficiency, and per-frame latency to assess suitability for real-time edge deployment.

Result: 3D CNN achieved 92.4% accuracy but required 3.2% more processing time per frame than LSTMs. LSTMs achieved 86.7% accuracy with lower resource consumption. The hybrid 3D CNN-LSTM performed decently.

Conclusion: Architecture choice should be context-dependent for practical real-time ASL systems, particularly in edge computing. The work provides benchmarks that help balance recognition precision against latency and resource use.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances steganography in visuals by using efficient latent representations and foveated rendering to boost payload capacity from 100 to 500 bits, while maintaining low error rates and competitive perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steganography in visual media is used for metadata and watermarking, but existing capacity limits constrain practical payloads and reliability. Improving capacity without sacrificing visual quality is desirable for robust secret communication and watermarking.

Method: Train models leveraging efficient latent representations and foveated rendering to create multi-modal latent representations for steganography. Evaluate on a 200K-bit test set, measure capacity (bits), error rate (1 bit error per 2000 bits), and perceptual quality (PSNR and LPIPS).

Result: Capacity increased from 100 to 500 bits. Error rate improved to at most 1 failure bit per 2000 bits at 200K test bits. Visual quality remains competitive with 31.47 dB PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS.

Conclusion: Novel perceptual design enabling multi-modal latent representations can significantly boost steganographic capacity while preserving perceptual quality and reliability.

Abstract: Steganography finds its use in visual medium such as providing metadata and
watermarking. With support of efficient latent representations and foveated
rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to
500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000,
at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB
PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in
creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.

*Meng Yang,Kecheng Chen,Wei Luo,Xianjie Chen,Yong Jia,Mingyue Wang,Fanqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dictionary-driven prior regularization with test-time adaptation (DP-TTA) for transient EM denoising, using a dictionary-encoded intrinsic TEM prior to guide dynamic adaptation and improve cross-region robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TEM signals have region-dependent noise, but intrinsic physical traits (like exponential decay and smoothness) are consistent across regions; leveraging these priors can improve denoising under different noise conditions.

Method: Develop DTEMDNet augmented with a dictionary-learning module that encodes intrinsic TEM characteristics as a prior; integrate this prior during training; at test time, adapt the model live by minimizing self-supervised losses based on dictionary-driven consistency and one-order signal variation.

Result: Empirical results show DP-TTA achieves substantially better denoising performance than existing TEM denoising methods and traditional test-time adaptation approaches.

Conclusion: Utilizing region-invariant, physics-based priors via dictionary-driven regularization enables effective test-time adaptation and robust TEM denoising across diverse environments.

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a GS-oriented edge training framework (STT-GS) for edge Gaussian splatting, featuring sample-then-transmit data collection, feature-domain clustering for representative samples, pilot transmission time minimization, and a joint client selection/power control (JCSPC) solved via PAMM, yielding improved GS quality under communication constraints with low sampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the causality dilemma between GS objective and data availability: aims to maximize Gaussian splatting quality by weighting heterogeneous client contributions in a distributed, communication-constrained edge setting.

Method: STT-GS: each client provides a small pilot subset to predict loss; feature-domain clustering (FDC) selects representative samples; pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) reduces pilot overhead; a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework optimizes the GS-oriented objective under communication constraints; a penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm solves the nonconvex optimization.

Result: Experiments show the proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks on real-world datasets; the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (about 10%); the method achieves a favorable tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.

Conclusion: The STT-GS strategy, with FDC and PTTM and PAMM-based JCSPC, provides an effective approach for GS-focused edge Gaussian splatting, enabling accurate loss prediction from small pilots and efficient resource allocation to maximize global splatting quality.

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

*Rongtao Xu,Jinzhou Lin,Jialei Zhou,Jiahua Dong,Changwei Wang,Ruisheng Wang,Li Guo,Shibiao Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIGOcc uses multi-level feature fusion and SAM distillation to boost camera-based occupancy prediction, achieving state-of-the-art on SemanticKITTI without extra training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit diverse 2D image features via representation fusion, addressing the limitations of architecture-centric improvements in camera-based 3D occupancy prediction.

Method: A two-stage framework that extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image, applies a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three feature types, and incorporates knowledge distillation from SAM; designed to improve accuracy without increasing training costs.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI occupancy benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-level 2D feature representations with SAM guidance via deformable fusion significantly enhances 3D occupancy prediction from images, highlighting the value of representation fusion.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

### [26] [Paper Copilot: Tracking the Evolution of Peer Review in AI Conferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13201)
*Jing Yang,Qiyao Wei,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper Copilot creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across computer-science venues, releasing an open dataset and infrastructure to enable reproducible research on the evolution of peer review, demonstrated through a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews over multiple years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI conferences strains the peer-review system, causing heavy workloads, expertise mismatches, inconsistent standards, superficial reviews, and limited accountability. There is a lack of transparency on how acceptance decisions evolve year to year.

Method: Develop Paper Copilot to (1) archive peer reviews across venues, (2) release an open dataset of reviews, and (3) conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews across multiple years.

Result: Provision of durable infrastructure for archiving reviews and an open dataset; a multi-year empirical analysis of ICLR reviews; enabling reproducible research and evidence-based study of peer-review evolution.

Conclusion: The resources enable the community to track changes, diagnose failure modes, and inform improvements toward a more robust, transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

### [27] [MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13208)
*Lianlian Liu,YongKang He,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MimicParts introduces region-aware style encoding and part-specific denoising to generate expressive 3D motion from speech, guided by rhythm and emotion cues, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current style encoding oversimplifies stylistic diversity and ignores regional body motion differences; motion must dynamically adapt to speech rhythm and emotion, motivating region-based and cue-guided modeling.

Method: Divide the body into regions; apply part-aware style injection to encode localized motion styles; employ a part-aware denoising network and a part-aware attention block that uses rhythm and emotion cues to guide each region's motion.

Result: Experimental results indicate MimicParts outperforms existing methods in naturalness and expressiveness of 3D human motion sequences.

Conclusion: Region-aware style encoding and cue-guided denoising enable fine-grained, rhythm- and emotion-consistent stylized motion from speech.

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

### [28] [Prompt-based Adaptation in Large-scale Vision Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13219)
*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Lin Zhao,Yiyang Liu,Xiaoying Liao,Zheda Mai,Xingjian Li,Xiao Wang,Hao Xu,Jihun Hamm,Xue Lin,Min Xu,Qifan Wang,Tianyang Wang,Cheng Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified Prompt-based Adaptation (PA) framework that subsumes Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), offering a taxonomy and a comprehensive survey of methods and applications, benchmarks, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve blurred boundaries between VP and VPT, provide a principled, unified framework, and guide researchers in adapting large vision models across domains with clarity and standardized concepts.

Method: Introduce PA as a unifying framework; categorize prompt methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts; organize by injection granularity (pixel-level vs token-level); survey applications across domains, examine test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI, summarize benchmarks, and outline challenges and future directions.

Result: Clarifies conceptual distinctions between VP and VPT, presents a structured taxonomy and unified framework (PA), maps methods to prompt types and granularities, surveys cross-domain applications, discusses practical aspects like test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI, and identifies benchmarks and gaps.

Conclusion: PA serves as a cohesive umbrella for VP/VPT, enabling clearer understanding and exploration of prompt-based adaptation; the survey provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners and highlights directions for standardized benchmarks and future work.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

### [29] [Sample-Centric Multi-Task Learning for Detection and Segmentation of Industrial Surface Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13226)
*Hang-Cheng Dong,Yibo Jiao,Fupeng Wei,Guodong Liu,Dong Ye,Bingguo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sample-centric multi-task learning framework for industrial surface defect inspection that jointly performs sample-level defect classification and pixel-level localization, with new decision-linked metrics to align evaluation with QC decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QC requires reliable sample-level decisions under extreme foreground-background imbalance, sparse and long-tailed defect distributions, and low contrast. Pixel-wise metrics (e.g., mIoU) can mislead optimization and overlook per-sample reliability; there is a mismatch between optimization objective and QC decision granularity.

Method: A shared-encoder architecture with two tasks: (1) sample-level defect classification and (2) pixel-level defect mask localization. Sample-level supervision modulates feature distribution and, at the gradient level, boosts recall for small/low-contrast defects; the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to improve per-sample decision stability. Evaluation introduces decision-linked metrics Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall that tie localization quality to sample-level decisions.

Result: On two benchmark datasets, the approach substantially improves the reliability of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization. The new Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall metrics mitigate biases caused by empty/truth-negative samples and better reflect end-to-end QC performance.

Conclusion: The paper presents a sample-centric, multi-task framework that aligns optimization with sample-level QC decisions and provides decision-linked metrics to evaluate localization quality in conjunction with per-sample decisions, addressing imbalance, sparsity, and low-contrast defects for more reliable industrial defect inspection.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

### [30] [What "Not" to Detect: Negation-Aware VLMs via Structured Reasoning and Token Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13232)
*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact, two-pronged approach tackles negation bias in vision-language models by (1) building CoVAND for high-quality, instance-grounded negation data and (2) introducing NegToMe, a token-merging module with LoRA fine-tuning to preserve negation polarity and boost negation understanding in DOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models exhibit affirmative bias and struggle with negation, especially in described object detection. This limits real-world detection performance and reliability when negation cues are present. A high-quality negation-focused dataset and a lightweight architectural fix are needed to improve robustness with limited data.

Method: 1) CoVAND: a dataset pipeline using systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a VQA-based process to generate instance-grounded negation data. 2) NegToMe: a token merging module that groups negation cues with attributes to form coherent semantic phrases, preserving polarity at the input level. It binds tokens like 'not' and 'girl' into a single token to prevent misinterpretation, and it is integrated with a parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning regime.

Result: Significant gains on negation benchmarks with reduced false positives, notably up to +10.8 NMS-AP on OVDEval, and demonstrated generalization to state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: The work advances negation understanding in real-world detection by combining a high-quality negation-focused dataset with a lightweight architectural fix, offering practical gains and generalization potential for current VLMs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

### [31] [UniVector: Unified Vector Extraction via Instance-Geometry Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13234)
*Yinglong Yan,Jun Yue,Shaobo Xia,Hanmeng Sun,Tianxu Ying,Chengcheng Wu,Sifan Lan,Min He,Pedram Ghamisi,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVector is a unified vector extraction framework that uses instance-geometry interaction with structured queries and iterative refinement, enabling a single model to extract polygons, polylines, and line segments. It introduces a Multi-Vector dataset and achieves state-of-the-art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector extraction (VE) methods typically specialize in one vector type (polygons, polylines, or line segments) and treat instance attributes and geometric attributes separately. This limits their ability to capture complex, multi-structure representations in a single model.

Method: UniVector encodes vector elements as structured queries containing both instance-level and geometry-level information. It iteratively updates these queries via an interaction module that facilitates cross-level semantic-spatial context exchange, inspired by human visual perception. A dynamic shape constraint further refines global structures and key points. The approach is evaluated on a newly proposed Multi-Vector dataset comprising polygons, polylines, and line segments.

Result: Experiments show UniVector achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-structure and multi-structure VE tasks. The authors also introduce a dataset to benchmark multi-structure VE, and promise code and dataset releases.

Conclusion: A unified VE framework leveraging instance-geometry interaction can effectively extract diverse vector types within one model, and the Multi-Vector dataset provides a benchmark for multi-structure VE, indicating strong generalization and performance gains.

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

### [32] [EPIPTrack: Rethinking Prompt Modeling with Explicit and Implicit Prompts for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13235)
*Yukuan Zhang,Jiarui Zhao,Shangqing Nie,Jin Kuang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIPTrack is a unified multimodal tracking framework that uses explicit and implicit prompts to dynamically model targets, guided by CLIP for alignment, and augmented by a Discriminative Feature Augmentor; it achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static textual descriptions from large language models are insufficient for real-time target state changes in tracking and can hallucinate; there is a need for a dynamic, adaptable, and discriminative multimodal approach to improve perception and tracking performance.

Method: Introduce explicit prompts that convert spatial motion into natural language descriptions for spatiotemporal guidance; introduce implicit prompts using pseudo-words plus learnable descriptors to form individualized appearance knowledge representations; dynamically adjust both prompts via the CLIP text encoder to respond to target state changes; incorporate a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers across diverse scenarios, demonstrating robust adaptability and superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates explicit/implicit prompts with CLIP-guided dynamic adjustments and feature augmentation to improve multimodal tracking performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

### [33] [Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13237)
*Haochuan Xu,Yun Sing Koh,Shuhuai Huang,Zirun Zhou,Di Wang,Jun Sakuma,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA) for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, a model-agnostic patch attack that disrupts visual-text latent alignment to induce task failure; paired with an adversarial fine-tuning defense for the visual encoder; validated on LIBERO with notable robustness degradation and its mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models enable natural language-driven robotic tasks, but their adversarial robustness is underexplored. Patch-like attacks that can be deployed in camera views threaten real-world performance; there is a need for defenses to safeguard perception-action pipelines.

Method: EDPA places patches within the camera view to disrupt semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations and maximize the discrepancy between adversarial and clean visual inputs. It is model-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of model architecture or controlled manipulator. A defense via adversarial fine-tuning trains the visual encoder to produce similar latent representations for clean and perturbed inputs. Evaluation is conducted on the LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark.

Result: EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of contemporary VLA models, demonstrating a significant vulnerability. The proposed adversarial fine-tuning defense mitigates this degradation. Code is released at the given URL.

Conclusion: The work reveals a practical vulnerability of VLA systems to patch-based adversarial attacks and provides an effective countermeasure through adversarial encoder fine-tuning, highlighting the need for robust perception in robot learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

### [34] [Through the Lens of Doubt: Robust and Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13464)
*Emily Miller,Michael Milford,Muhammad Burhan Hafez,SD Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces three training-free uncertainty metrics (Similarity Distribution, Ratio Spread, Statistical Uncertainty) to estimate VPR prediction confidence purely from similarity score distributions, generalizing across datasets and methods without training or geometric verification; shows improved discrimination of correct vs. incorrect matches with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR struggles under appearance changes, lighting, seasonality, and viewpoint shifts; reliable estimation of place-matching uncertainty is crucial for loop closure in SLAM. Existing approaches often require training data or expensive geometric verification. There is a need for training-free, method-agnostic uncertainty measures that work in real time across diverse conditions.

Method: Three metrics computed from similarity score distributions: SD quantifies separation between candidate matches; RS assesses competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; SU combines SD and RS into a unified measure that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data. No training, architectural changes, or geometric verification needed.

Result: Empirical evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets shows the metrics effectively discriminate between correct and incorrect VPR matches and consistently outperform existing approaches, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: These training-free metrics enable robust, real-time uncertainty estimation for VPR across varied environments, improving precision-recall performance without additional training or verification, and are broadly compatible with diverse VPR methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

TL;DR: FlyAwareV2 is a multimodal UAV dataset (RGB, depth, semantic labels) with real and synthetic urban imagery, spanning diverse conditions, offering real-depth estimates, benchmarks, and synthetic-to-real domain-adaptation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field needs large-scale, richly annotated UAV datasets for urban perception, which are costly to collect; existing data are limited in modality, environmental variation, and domain transfer, hindering robust model development for 3D urban understanding.

Method: Develop a new dataset FlyAwareV2 building on SynDrone and FlyAware, collecting/curating multimodal data (RGB, depth, semantic labels) across diverse weather and daytime settings; compute depth maps for real samples via monocular depth estimation; provide semantic segmentation benchmarks on standard architectures; perform synthetic-to-real domain adaptation experiments to evaluate generalization.

Result: Introduces a new multimodal UAV dataset with real and synthetic urban imagery, including RGB, depth, and semantic labels across varied conditions; real-depth is derived via monocular estimation; establishes segmentation benchmarks on common architectures; presents insights into how synthetic data can transfer to real scenes.

Conclusion: FlyAwareV2 is a valuable resource for advancing UAV-based urban scene understanding, enabling multimodal segmentation research and domain adaptation studies, and potentially reducing annotation costs while improving generalization to real-world conditions.

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

### [36] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comparative study of GPU vs FPGA acceleration for feature detectors in a Visual SLAM pipeline on modern SoCs. Non-learning detectors (FAST, Harris) favor GPU acceleration in runtime and energy; a learning-based detector (SuperPoint) benefits from FPGA acceleration. Overall, GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate; FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve comparable runtime in some cases. Hardware acceleration can further boost performance by enabling less frequent global bundle adjustment without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance and energy trade-offs of hardware-accelerated feature detectors within a Visual SLAM pipeline on contemporary SoCs, guiding design choices for SLAM acceleration.

Method: Experimental evaluation comparing GPU- and FPGA-accelerated implementations of FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint on Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal. Metrics include runtime, energy efficiency, FPS, and accuracy across multiple dataset sequences. Analysis of impact on the SLAM pipeline, including bundle adjustment frequency.

Result: For non-learning detectors (FAST, Harris), GPU implementations and GPU-accelerated V-SLAM outperform FPGA counterparts in run-time and energy efficiency. For the learning-based detector SuperPoint, FPGA implementation outperforms GPU in run-time (up to 3.1x) and energy efficiency (up to 1.4x). FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM achieves comparable run-time to GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 of 5 sequences. In terms of accuracy, GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is generally more accurate than FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. Hardware acceleration can improve overall V-SLAM performance by allowing the global bundle adjustment module to be invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The results suggest a heterogeneous design strategy: use GPU acceleration for non-learning feature detectors and FPGA acceleration for learning-based detectors within V-SLAM on modern SoCs. While GPU-based V-SLAM is generally more accurate, FPGA-based acceleration can offer significant gains for learning-based detectors and can match or exceed GPU performance in some sequences. This motivates co-design of SLAM pipelines and potential adjustments to bundle adjustment cadence to exploit hardware acceleration without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

*Li Liang,Bo Miao,Xinyu Wang,Naveed Akhtar,Jordan Vice,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchSem3D introduces the first large-scale outdoor 3D semantic scene benchmark generated from abstract sketches and pseudo-labeled satellite annotations, plus CymbaDiff, a diffusion model that enforces structured spatial coherence for realistic 3D landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available, well-annotated datasets for outdoor 3D semantic scene generation, hindering standardized evaluation and progress in applications like urban simulation and autonomous driving.

Method: Propose SketchSem3D with two subsets (Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360) and Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff). CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, cylindrical continuity, and vertical hierarchy to preserve local neighborhood relations and global context in generated scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments show CymbaDiff yields superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization on SketchSem3D.

Conclusion: The dataset and CymbaDiff enable standardized, rigorous evaluation of outdoor 3D scene generation from sketches; code and data will be released to foster future research.

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

*Zhiyuan Zhao,Yubin Wen,Siyu Yang,Lichen Ning,Yuandong Liu,Junyu Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stem-encoder-decoder crowd counting model tailored for embedded real-time inference, delivering state-of-the-art speed with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the demand for real-time crowd counting on embedded systems where existing models are too large or computationally heavy, hindering deployment in security, urban planning, and public safety contexts.

Method: A stem-encoder-decoder architecture employing large convolution kernels in the stem to enlarge receptive fields, a low-cost encoder using conditional channel weighting and a multi-branch local fusion block to fuse multi-scale features, and feature pyramid networks to improve feature fusion at the top.

Result: The method achieves the fastest inference among state-of-the-art methods, with 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1, while maintaining competitive accuracy across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The network is suitable for super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, achieving real-time performance with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

### [39] [Map the Flow: Revealing Hidden Pathways of Information in VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13251)
*Minji Kim,Taekyung Kim,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLLMs reason temporally through a two-stage information flow: early cross-frame interactions drive temporal reasoning, followed by middle-layer video-language alignment enabling integration, with answer generation in middle-to-late layers; performance can be preserved by pruning attention pathways (around 58%), revealing interpretable information routes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how VideoLLMs process and propagate video and textual information for temporal reasoning, advancing interpretability and generalization.

Method: Apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to trace information flow across layers in VideoLLMs during VideoQA tasks; analyze cross-frame interactions, alignment between video representations and temporal linguistic concepts, and gatekeeping of attention edges; quantify edge suppression (e.g., ~58% in a given model) and assess impact on performance; report findings and provide a project page.

Result: Identified consistent patterns across tasks: early cross-frame interactions seed temporal reasoning; middle layers integrate video and language; output generation occurs in middle-to-late layers; robust performance is achievable by using effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial portion of attention edges (e.g., 58%), offering a blueprint for temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides a blueprint for understanding temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs, delivering practical insights for interpretability and generalization; the approach enables targeted pathway pruning without sacrificing performance; project page available.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

*Chunhao Lu,Qiang Lu,Meichen Dong,Jake Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDM introduces a unified end-to-end multi-modal diffusion framework using a Mamba-based diffusion model and a unified variational autoencoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional data and long sequences, while remaining competitive with top multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end multi-modal systems use separate encoders/decoders for different modalities, hindering joint representation learning and efficient cross-modal reasoning. A unified processing approach is desired to improve performance and efficiency across modalities.

Method: Propose MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba), a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model that progressively generates and refines modality-specific information through a single unified variational autoencoder that handles both encoding and decoding across modalities.

Result: MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (e.g., MonoFormer, LlamaGen, Chameleon) and is competitive with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral across tasks including image generation, image captioning, VQA, text comprehension, and reasoning, while maintaining computational efficiency and excelling with high-resolution images and long text sequences.

Conclusion: The study validates that unifying multi-modal processes within a diffusion-based framework is effective and opens a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

*Keyan Zhou,Zecheng Tang,Lingfeng Ming,Guanghao Zhou,Qiguang Chen,Dan Qiao,Zheming Yang,Libo Qin,Minghui Qiu,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLongCite introduces a benchmark to evaluate long-context faithfulness in multimodal LVLMs, across 8 tasks, 6 context-length intervals, and modalities including text, images, and videos, revealing limited fidelity of SOTA models in long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the mismatch between expanded context windows of LVLMs and their actual ability to utilize long multimodal context; existing long-context evaluations are mostly text-only, with short-context multimodal assessments.

Method: Construct MMLongCite with 8 distinct tasks spanning 6 context-length intervals and multiple modalities; evaluate state-of-the-art LVLMs on fidelity of long-context understanding; analyze influence of context length and content position on faithfulness.

Result: SOTA LVLMs exhibit limited faithfulness in long multimodal contexts; fidelity degrades as context length increases; the position of crucial content significantly impacts model performance.

Conclusion: Long-context fidelity remains a challenge; calls for improved evaluation protocols and model strategies to better utilize long multimodal histories and content-aware reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [42] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training (MaskDCPT) jointly learns degradation-type classification and high-quality restoration from masked low-quality inputs, yielding robust universal restoration and strong generalization, with notable PSNR and PIQE gains and a large-scale dataset release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degradation types are diverse and data for restoration are limited. Conventional pretraining lacks supervision about degradation types and may not optimally support restoration tasks. A method that uses degradation-type labels as weak supervision while leveraging masked image modeling and reconstruction can improve robustness and generalization.

Method: An encoder processes masked low-quality images. Two decoders branch from the features: a classification decoder predicts the degradation type, while a reconstruction decoder restores a high-quality image. The model trains with masked image modeling and contrastive cues, using degradation-type supervision as weak labels. The approach supports both CNNs and Transformers and is evaluated with a large-scale UIR-2.5M dataset (2.5M paired samples across 19 degradation types and 200 levels).

Result: MaskDCPT yields substantial gains across architectures: a minimum PSNR improvement of 3.77 dB on a 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE under real-world degradations, along with strong generalization to unseen degradation types. The UIR-2.5M dataset, source code, and models are released to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: MaskDCPT offers a simple yet effective pre-training paradigm for universal image restoration by combining masked image modeling with weak degradation supervision, resulting in robust representations usable by CNNs and Transformers. The large UIR-2.5M dataset further supports reproducibility and broad applicability.

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

TL;DR: A real-time document classification system detects text in images and classifies documents into four categories (Invoice, Report, Letter, Form) using DBNet++ for detection and BART for classification, robust to challenging imaging conditions, with ~92.9% detection accuracy on Total-Text, and a PyQt5 UI for offline and live capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automatic, robust classification of documents captured from diverse sources (offline images and real-time camera feeds) under challenging imaging conditions such as variable illumination, orientation, occlusions, and low resolution.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: (1) image capture and preprocessing, (2) text detection with DBNet++ detector, (3) text classification with a BART classifier, integrated in a Python PyQt5 UI, supporting offline and real-time capture.

Result: Text detection accuracy reported around 92.88% on the Total-Text dataset under challenging conditions, indicating robustness; system effectively enables practical mixed-source document categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective and practical solution for automatic document classification in unconstrained imaging environments, combining state-of-the-art text detection with transformer-based classification in a user-friendly interface.

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

### [44] [Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation via Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13307)
*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework for 3D Novel Class Discovery in point cloud segmentation, learning causal representations of base classes and using a prototype graph to reason about novel classes, achieving superior performance on 3D/2D NCD segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To segment unseen (novel) 3D classes using only base-class supervision, avoiding confounding correlations from coarse statistical learning by enforcing causal relationships that reveal true class-relevant representations.

Method: Formalize 3D-NCD with SCM; identify and remove hidden confounders in base representations through a causal representation prototype; model causal links between base prototypes and novel prototypes via a graph to enable causal reasoning from base to novel classes.

Result: Extensive experiments and visualizations on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the method's superiority over baselines.

Conclusion: A causal-representation-based joint learning approach can better discover and transfer information from base to novel classes in 3D-NCD, mitigating confounding factors and enabling more accurate segmentation of novel classes.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

### [45] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free decoding strategy for LVLMs that uses self-augmentation prompting and adaptive thresholding to reduce hallucinations and improve factual consistency, validated across multiple models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs inherit hallucination tendencies from language models, and existing visual decoding methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore the specific query context, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Introduce two components: (1) self-augmentation prompting that leverages the model's intrinsic knowledge to dynamically align the semantics between the user query and the visual augmentation; (2) adaptive thresholding that adjusts the next-token candidate size based on output sparsity by leveraging the full logit distribution, without any training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four LVLMs and seven benchmarks shows the proposed decoding significantly improves factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods.

Conclusion: Integrating query-dependent augmentation with entropy-aware decoding is crucial for enhancing the factual accuracy and effective generation of LVLMs, even without additional training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

### [46] [InstantSfM: Fully Sparse and Parallel Structure-from-Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13310)
*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPU-accelerated, unified global Structure-from-Motion (InstantSfM) that speeds up BA and GP using sparse-aware optimization, achieving up to 40x speedups over COLMAP on large-scale datasets while maintaining comparable or improved accuracy and enabling flexible optimization options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale SfM faces a speed-accuracy trade-off: CPU-heavy BA/GP slows down, traditional instruments like COLMAP/GLOMAP have limited flexibility, and deep-learning SfM methods struggle with thousands of views due to GPU memory. A flexible, fast, scalable SfM pipeline is needed.

Method: Extend sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization to accelerate both BA and global positioning (GP) within a unified global SfM framework. Leverage GPU parallel computation to accelerate all critical stages of the SfM pipeline, enabling scalable performance on large datasets (e.g., ~5000 images).

Result: Significant speedups (up to ~40x) over COLMAP with reconstruction accuracy that is consistently comparable or better. The approach handles large-scale input where DL-based methods fail due to memory, showing robust performance across varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: A GPU-based, flexible SfM framework that matches or exceeds COLMAP in accuracy while delivering substantial speedups and scalability, demonstrating the viability of GPU-accelerated sparse optimization for large-scale SfM.

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o shows partial alignment with human judgments on visual interestingness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods; can label image pairs for training a learning-to-rank model to predict interestingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well large multimodal models capture the perceptual concept of visual interestingness and how their predictions compare to human judgments, with implications for data labeling and ranking tasks.

Method: Compare human assessments of image interestingness with GPT-4o predictions through a comparative analysis; evaluate alignment; select image pairs with agreed-upon interestingness to serve as training data and distill this into a learning-to-rank model.

Result: Partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o; GPT-4o best among current methods at capturing the concept of visual interestingness; can effectively label image pairs by interestingness, enabling training data for a learning-to-rank model.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of human interest in visuals and demonstrates a practical approach to leveraging LMM predictions for labeling and distilling ranking models, paving the way for deeper exploration of visual interestingness.

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

### [48] [Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317)
*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a training approach that eliminates the cost volume from optical flow estimators during training, yielding faster, lower-memory models with competitive accuracy; produces three budgeted variants; the top model matches state-of-the-art accuracy while being 1.2× faster and using 6× less memory, and the fastest model processes Full HD at 20 FPS with 500 MB GPU memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cost volumes are computationally and memory-intensive in optical flow methods, often bottlenecking speed and input resolution. The authors observe that cost volumes lose importance as other network components are sufficiently trained, suggesting they can be removed during training without sacrificing performance.

Method: Propose a training strategy that trains optical flow networks (e.g., RAFT-based) without using cost volumes, and instantiate three models for different compute budgets. Evaluate against baselines to demonstrate speed/memory gains while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Result: The training strategy yields three budgeted models. The top model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being 1.2× faster and using 6× less memory than comparable models. The fastest model can process Full HD frames at 20 FPS with 500 MB of GPU memory.

Conclusion: Cost-volume-free training is effective for optical flow, enabling faster, memory-efficient deployment without sacrificing accuracy, and is viable across multiple compute budgets.

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Top Vision-Language Models perform best with simple prompts for zero-shot posture classification; adding descriptive detail can degrade performance (prompt overfitting); a weaker model (SigLip) may benefit from richer, body-cue prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how prompt design affects zero-shot recognition of visually similar actions (sitting, standing, walking) in VLMs, addressing a gap in how linguistic cues influence fine-grained posture inference.

Method: Systematic evaluation on a small COCO-derived dataset (n=285) using three-tiered prompt designs with three models (OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2, SigLip) across three posture classes; report multi-class accuracy and analyze prompt-depth effects.

Result: Highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2; OpenCLIP) achieve best accuracy with the simplest prompts; adding descriptive detail leads to notable drop (e.g., MetaCLIP 2 multi-class accuracy from 68.8% to 55.1%); phenomenon termed 'prompt overfitting'. Lower-performing SigLip improves performance on ambiguous classes with more descriptive prompts.

Conclusion: Prompt design effects in VLM zero-shot classification are non-monotonic; simple prompts can outperform richer ones for top models, while richer prompts may aid weaker models. This calls for careful prompt design and possibly model-specific guidance when targeting fine-grained, visually similar categories.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

### [50] [DEF-YOLO: Leveraging YOLO for Concealed Weapon Detection in Thermal Imagin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13326)
*Divya Bhardwaj,Arnav Ramamoorthy,Poonam Goyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A YOLOv8-based detector (DEF-YOLO) for thermal concealed weapon detection, integrating deformable convolutions at the SPPF, multi-scale feature extraction, and focal loss; plus a new TICW dataset; claims real-time, privacy-preserving performance and new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concealed weapon detection requires fast, accurate, and privacy-preserving surveillance. Thermal imaging offers privacy and cost advantages but lacks a large benchmark dataset and architectures tailored to the unique challenges of thermal imagery (e.g., homogeneous regions, low contrast). The paper aims to address these gaps by proposing a specialized detector and a large-scale dataset.

Method: Proposes DEF-YOLO, a YOLOv8-based architecture augmented with deformable convolutions in the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features; employs backbone/neck enhancements to capture low-, mid-, and high-level features for improved localization in thermal-homogeneous regions; incorporates focal loss to mitigate severe class imbalance; introduces TICW, a large-scale thermal imaging concealed weapon dataset to train/evaluate the model.

Result: Extensive experiments show DEF-YOLO sets a new benchmark for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery, achieving effective localization in challenging thermal regions while maintaining real-time speed and throughput.

Conclusion: DEF-YOLO, together with the TICW dataset, offers a practical, fast, privacy-preserving solution for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery and establishes a new standard in this niche; potential avenues include cross-modality validation and further refinements to handle diverse thermal conditions.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

*Hong-Kai Zheng,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group-VQ proposes group-wise codebook optimization and training-free codebook resampling to address codebook collapse in VQ-VAEs, improving reconstruction quality and codebook flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome codebook collapse and limited learning in standard VQ-VAE approaches that rely on static or fully learned codebooks, which constrain reconstruction quality.

Method: Divide codebook into groups; optimize each group independently with joint optimization within a group; introduce training-free codebook resampling to adjust codebook size post-training.

Result: Experiments on image reconstruction show improved reconstruction metrics and better codebook utilization; resampling offers post-training size adjustment.

Conclusion: Group-VQ enhances the trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction quality; resampling adds flexibility; potential applicability beyond the tested settings.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

*Sipeng Yang,Jiayu Ji,Qingchuan Zhu,Zhiyao Yang,Xiaogang Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A rendering-oriented NR-VQA dataset with a tailored metric that factors image quality and temporal stability; achieves better correlation with human judgments on rendered videos and supports benchmarking rendering techniques like supersampling and frame generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-VQA datasets emphasize camera-captured videos and often fail to capture temporal artifacts common in rendered content, leading to biased quality predictions. There is a need for a rendering-focused dataset and a no-reference metric that aligns with human perception for rendered videos.

Method: Create a large dataset of rendered videos covering diverse 3D scenes and rendering settings; annotate quality scores for multiple displays; design and calibrate an NR-VQA metric that combines image quality and temporal stability; compare to existing NR-VQA metrics on rendered videos; demonstrate utility by benchmarking supersampling methods and real-time frame-generation strategies.

Result: The proposed NR-VQA metric shows superior correlation with subjective judgments on rendered videos compared to existing NR-VQA metrics; the dataset provides extensive subjective annotations across scenes and display types; the metric is applicable for benchmarking rendering pipelines (supersampling and frame generation) in real-time rendering.

Conclusion: A rendering-focused NR-VQA dataset and metric address biases in existing NR-VQA tools, enabling more accurate assessment of rendered video quality and practical benchmarking of rendering techniques in real-time applications.

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthVLA adds a pretrained depth module to Vision-Language-Action models via a mixture-of-transformers with shared attention, improving spatial reasoning and achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world and simulated tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs struggle with precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial grounding inherited from VLMs and reliance on extensive action-data pretraining for 3D grounding, which hurts efficiency and generalization.

Method: A mixture-of-transformers architecture unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions. A pretrained depth prediction module is incorporated to supply spatial cues, enabling end-to-end training of the model.

Result: DepthVLA outperforms prior methods across tasks: real-world progress 78.5% vs 65.0%; LIBERO simulator 94.9% vs 93.6%; Simpler simulator 74.8% vs 58.8%. Code will be released.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating depth-based spatial awareness via a shared-attention, end-to-end DepthVLA design yields improved spatial reasoning in VLA tasks and demonstrates strong cross-domain performance; beneficial for efficient grounding without large action-data pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

### [54] [Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13381)
*Siddharth Tourani,Jayaram Reddy,Akash Kumbar,Satyajit Tourani,Nishant Goyal,Madhava Krishna,N. Dinesh Reddy,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework combines Signed Distance Functions with 3D Gaussian Splatting to model dynamic urban scenes, reducing reliance on LiDAR and 3D motion labels while achieving high-quality rendering; enables scene editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGaussian Splatting (3DGS) based dynamic scene methods for urban scenes require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations, and motion data (tracklets or templates). The work aims to relax these constraints by using 2D object-agnostic priors (depth, point tracking) and an SDF representation for dynamic objects.

Method: Joint optimization that fuses Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), integrating depth cues and 2D point tracking as priors to improve geometry and deformation modeling, yielding a unified framework for robust object representation.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering metrics without LiDAR on urban scenes; when LiDAR is available, it further improves reconstruction and novel-view synthesis across diverse object categories, without requiring ground-truth 3D motion annotations.

Conclusion: The SDF–3DGS integration provides a more adaptable and precise representation, enabling scene editing (decomposition and composition) and relaxing data requirements for dynamic urban scene modeling.

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

*Tiancheng Gu,Kaicheng Yang,Kaichen Zhang,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Yueyi Zhang,Weidong Cai,Jiankang Deng,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal multimodal embedding framework (UniME-V2) uses MLLMs as judges to mine hard negatives with soft semantic scores, aligns similarity with soft labels, and includes a reranker; achieves state-of-the-art results on MMEB and other retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of in-batch negative mining—insufficient semantic discrimination, lack of negative diversity, and brittle one-to-one mappings—by leveraging advanced MLLMs to provide semantic guidance for hard negative mining and supervision.

Method: 1) Build potential hard negatives via global retrieval. 2) Use MLLM-as-a-Judge to produce soft semantic matching scores for query-candidate pairs. 3) Use these scores to mine diverse, high-quality hard negatives and as soft labels to relax the one-to-one constraint. 4) Align the similarity matrix with the soft score matrix to improve semantic discrimination. 5) Train UniME-V2 and a UniME-V2-Reranker via joint pairwise/listwise optimization on mined negatives.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on average across the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic-guided hard negative mining with soft labels and a reranking stage significantly improves discriminative capability of universal multimodal embeddings, mitigating false negatives and benefiting diverse tasks.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLSDA is a generalization framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition that leverages pre-trained large models to improve in-domain and cross-domain performance through semantic alignment and a lightweight distillation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSI-based gesture recognition suffers from domain sensitivity and limited semantic expressiveness; large foundation-model semantics can provide robust priors for gesture categories.

Method: A dual-path CSI encoding (CSI-Ratio phase, Doppler spectrogram) feeds a Multiscale Semantic Encoder with cross-modal attention; Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision encodes inter-class relations; Robust Dual-Distillation compresses teacher into a lightweight student with feature and soft-label distillation.

Result: On Widar3.0, GLSDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and cross-domain gestures, with reduced model size and lower latency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that integrating large-model semantic priors with RF sensing yields improved generalization and deployability for RF-based gesture interfaces in AIoT.

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A four-quadrant Spatial-DISE benchmark for intrinsic/extrinsic and static/dynamic spatial reasoning in VLMs, with 559 eval pairs and 12K+ training pairs, validated across 28 models, highlighting large gaps to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to capture intrinsic-dynamic spatial reasoning; a cognitively grounded, scalable benchmark is needed to advance real-world VLM applications (robotics, AR, navigation).

Method: Propose a four-quadrant taxonomy (Intrinsic-Static, Intrinsic-Dynamic, Extrinsic-Static, Extrinsic-Dynamic); develop an automated pipeline to generate diverse, verifiable spatial reasoning questions; assemble Spatial-DISE Bench (559 VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs); evaluate 28 state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: Found strong human-vs-model gaps, especially on multi-step, multi-view spatial reasoning; current VLMs lag behind humans across the benchmark.

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE provides a robust framework and dataset to drive future work toward human-like spatial intelligence; benchmark, dataset, and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An agent-based streaming FER benchmark reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blur interact to shape recognition robustness. It shows asymmetric degradation across cultures (Asian JAFFE vs Western KDEF) and indicates mixed cultures produce intermediate patterns; interaction structure influences robustness under degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER systems must be robust to cultural variation and perceptual degradation, but existing evaluations are often on homogeneous, high-quality data. A dynamic, cross-cultural benchmark can reveal biases and robustness characteristics that static tests miss.

Method: An agent-based simulation where agents operate in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move on a 5x5 lattice and receive sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur inputs. Populations include monocultural (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed (balanced 5/5, imbalanced 8/2 and 2/8) with varying spatial contact structures.

Result: Results show asymmetric degradation: JAFFE (Asian) maintains higher performance at low blur but drops sharply at intermediate blur, while KDEF (Western) degrades more uniformly. Mixed populations yield intermediate patterns; balanced mixtures mitigate early degradation; imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur.

Conclusion: Cultural composition and interaction structure meaningfully influence FER robustness under deteriorating perceptual conditions. The benchmark quantifies biases related to culture and interaction topology, informing design of fairer, more robust FER systems. Limitations include synthetic agent-based setup and reliance on a fixed CLIP feature space.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask-GRPO applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL to masked generative models for text-to-image generation, reframing unmasking as a multi-step decision process and achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for text-to-image generation has largely focused on diffusion or autoregressive models. Masked generative models remain underexplored for RL, representing a promising alternative that could leverage their unmasking dynamics and efficiency.

Method: Redefine the transition probability for the unmasking process and formulate it as a multi-step decision-making problem. Employ GRPO-based RL, with strategies such as removing the KL constraint, applying a reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Evaluate by improving a base model (Show-o) on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment.

Result: Mask-GRPO yields substantial improvements over the base model Show-o on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: This work is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL into masked generative models for text-to-image generation, showing that reframing unmasking as multi-step decisions and employing practical RL strategies can achieve strong performance and alignment with human preferences; code is released.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

*Jianhui Zhang,Sheng Cheng,Qirui Sun,Jia Liu,Wang Luyang,Chaoyu Feng,Chen Fang,Lei Lei,Jue Wang,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter introduces a two-stage adapter framework to enable 4K+ text-guided inpainting by decoupling global structural coherence from local detail refinement, achieving state-of-the-art results on OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based inpainting methods struggle with high-resolution, texture-rich images, facing content inconsistency and prompt misalignment as resolution increases. There is a need for scalable approaches that extend 1K models to 4K+ without major architectural overhauls.

Method: A two-stage adapter design: (1) Dual Context Adapter operates at reduced resolutions to enforce global coherence between masked and unmasked regions, establishing global structural consistency; (2) Reference Patch Adapter performs patch-level attention at full resolution, enabling adaptive feature fusion to preserve local detail fidelity during full-resolution inpainting. This decouples global semantics from localized refinement while avoiding structural changes to the diffusion model.

Result: Experimental results show reduced artifacts in large-scale inpainting and state-of-the-art performance on OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket, in terms of perceptual quality and alignment with text prompts.

Conclusion: The dual-stage Patch-Adapter addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by separating global structure from local details, enabling 4K+ inpainting with better content fidelity and prompt adherence without requiring rearchitecting the diffusion model.

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

TL;DR: CoDS introduces domain-separation-based feature alignment for heterogeneous multi-agent perception, using LSCR and DADS with a DAMI loss in a fully convolutional architecture to improve robustness and efficiency.


<details>

Motivation: Real-world collaborative perception faces encoder heterogeneity and domain gaps; aligning to a single ego feature is vulnerable to noise and domain shifts, and transformer-based adapters are inefficient for mobile deployment.

Method: Two alignment modules: LSCR (lightweight spatial-channel resizer) aligns neighbor features with lightweight convolutions; DADS provides encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation to remove domain-dependent information while preserving task-related signals; DAMI loss maximizes mutual information between aligned features to reinforce alignment; the model is fully convolutional for fast inference.

Result: Experiments indicate CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a favorable trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: CoDS enables robust, efficient collaborative perception under encoder heterogeneity by combining domain separation and mutual-information-guided alignment, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

*Pavithra Elumalai,Mohammad Bashiri,Goirik Chakrabarty,Suhas Shrinivasan,Fabian H. Sinz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A differentiable rendering approach learns 3D, deformable mesh stimuli to maximize neural responses, enabling MEIs in 3D to probe 3D scene factors (pose, lighting) in V4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D pixel-based methods cannot disentangle selectivity to 3D scene properties; there is a need for physically interpretable stimuli to understand how visual neurons encode shape, pose, and lighting.

Method: The authors use a differentiable rendering pipeline to optimize deformable meshes, parameterized with radial basis functions, learning vertex offsets and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric regularity. This yields MEIs directly in 3D and is applied to models of monkey area V4 to probe selectivity to interpretables like pose and lighting.

Result: The approach enables probing neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors (pose, lighting) and provides a bridge between inverse graphics and systems neuroscience, enabling 3D stimuli beyond conventional pixel-based methods.

Conclusion: This framework offers a physically grounded 3D stimulus paradigm for studying visual cortical selectivity, with potential applicability to other brain regions and a range of 3D scene factors.

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

### [63] [CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13669)
*Zian Li,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanvasMAR adds a canvas-based global prior to masked autoregressive video generation to overcome slow-start and error accumulation, using a blurred canvas as a starting point, compositional classifier-free guidance to expand spatial/temporal conditioning, and noise-based canvas augmentation. It achieves high-quality video with fewer autoregressive steps, performing well on BAIR and Kinetics-600 and rivaling diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAR-based video generation struggles with a weak global prior at early sampling and error accumulation across space and time. The paper aims to provide an explicit, global initial prediction (canvas) to bootstrap generation and improve coherence and efficiency.

Method: Introduce a canvas mechanism: a blurred, global prediction of the next frame used as the starting point for masked generation. Enhance conditioning with compositional classifier-free guidance to jointly enlarge spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning. Use noise-based canvas augmentation to improve robustness.

Result: Experiments on BAIR and Kinetics-600 show high-quality video generation with fewer autoregressive steps. CanvasMAR achieves strong performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 and rivals diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: The canvas mechanism successfully mitigates slow-start and error accumulation in video MAR, enabling faster, more coherent video synthesis and competitive performance compared to diffusion models; the approach demonstrates the value of explicit global priors in autoregressive video generation.

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

### [64] [Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis -- Improving Algorithms and Methodologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13452)
*Ole-Christian Galbo Engstrøm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint spatio-spectral CNNs outperform traditional spatial CNNs and PLS for NIR-HSI food quality tasks; adding a spectral convolution layer to 2D CNNs helps mimic expert spectral preprocessing; PLS matches mean chemical content but struggles for spatial maps; some results remain inconclusive due to dataset limitations; two open-source tools for PLS and fast model validation released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how near-infrared hyperspectral imaging can be leveraged for food quality analysis by comparing CNN-based joint spatio-spectral models with traditional PLS methods, and to explore spectral preprocessing and spatial mapping challenges, while contributing open-source tools.

Method: Four studies with five hypotheses using NIR-HSI data; comparisons between CNNs and PLS for modeling chemico-physical parameters; 2D CNNs augmented with an initial spectral convolution layer; use of bulk mean references for spatial maps in pork fat content; analysis incorporating NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI for barley germination; development of two open-source Python packages for fast PLS modeling and cross-validation of PLS with other classical models.

Result: Joint spatio-spectral CNNs outperformed analyses using only spatial CNNs or PLS-based spectral modeling for parameters where chemical/physical visual information is informative. Augmenting 2D CNNs with a spectral convolution layer improved chemical-parameter predictions by mimicking spectral preprocessing. PLS-based spectral models were competitive for mean chemical content but produced non-smooth spatial maps and out-of-range predictions in fat-content mapping, which the 2D CNN with spectral convolution mitigated. The barley germination study remained inconclusive due to dataset limitations. Two open-source Python packages were released: one for fast PLS-based modeling and another for very fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical ML models with a new algorithm.

Conclusion: For NIR-HSI food-quality analyses, joint spatio-spectral CNNs offer the strongest predictive gains when chemical/visual cues are informative, while PLS remains a solid baseline for mean-content predictions. Spectral preprocessing via an initial spectral convolution layer is beneficial for 2D CNNs. Spatial mapping remains challenging due to reference-data limitations. The work also contributes practical tools that facilitate rapid PLS modeling and cross-validation.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

### [65] [MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering and Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13702)
*Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Sooyeon Go,Jin-Hwa Kim,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVCustom unifies multi-view generation and customization using a diffusion-based framework that learns geometry and identity via a feature-field, with depth-aware rendering and consistent-aware latent completion to ensure pose control and customization fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work treats multi-view generation and customization separately, suffering from geometric inconsistency or lack of explicit viewpoint control, and is data-hungry due to reliance on large datasets.

Method: MVCustom uses a diffusion backbone (text-to-video with dense spatio-temporal attention) to learn subject identity and geometry via a feature-field representation during training. Inference adds depth-aware feature rendering to enforce geometric consistency and consistent-aware latent completion for accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject with surroundings.

Result: Experiments show MVCustom is the sole framework reported to simultaneously achieve faithful multi-view generation and customization, addressing both geometry-consistent views and customization fidelity.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified, diffusion-based approach that achieves joint multi-view consistency and customization, indicating strong potential for controllable, geometry-aligned generative modeling.

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

### [66] [VIST3A: Text-to-3D by Stitching a Multi-view Reconstruction Network to a Video Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13454)
*Hyojun Go,Dominik Narnhofer,Goutam Bhat,Prune Truong,Federico Tombari,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST3A stitches a latent text-to-video generator with a 3D decoder, then fine-tunes via rewards to align latents with decodable, coherent 3D geometry. It eliminates label requirements and beats Gaussian-splat baselines, and can yield high-quality text-to-pointmaps with the right base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality text-to-3D generation by leveraging powerful pretrained text-to-video models while preserving their knowledge and avoiding labeled data, ultimately improving geometric coherence in 3D reconstructions.

Method: 1) Model stitching: locate a compatible layer in the 3D decoder that matches the latent representation from the text-to-video generator and connect them using an unlabeled, small dataset. 2) Alignment: apply direct reward finetuning to align the generator outputs with the stitched 3D decoder so that latents decode into convincing 3D geometry. 3) Evaluation across multiple video generators and 3D decoders.

Result: All tested pairings significantly outperform prior text-to-3D approaches that produce Gaussian splats. With an appropriate 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Conclusion: VIST3A provides a general, data-efficient framework for combining latent text-to-video generation with 3D decoding, yielding improved 3D content from text and expanding capabilities to pointmaps when a suitable 3D base model is selected.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces LSGC for ViG to cap long-range links; LogViG with multi-scale HR fusion achieves stronger accuracy with fewer parameters/GMACs than existing ViG/CNN/ViT; small Ti-LogViG reaches 79.9% top-1 on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KNN-based graph construction for Vision Graph Networks is computationally expensive on large images. SVGA's fixed step scale can cause over-squashing and miss important long-range connections, limiting ViG performance. There is a need for scalable, efficient long-range connectivity to improve ViG effectiveness.

Method: Propose Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to limit the number of long-range links. Develop LogViG, a hybrid CNN-GNN model that uses LSGC. Introduce a high-resolution (HR) branch and fuse features between HR and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network.

Result: LogViG outperforms existing ViGs, CNNs, and ViTs in accuracy, GMACs, and parameter count on image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks. The smallest variant, Ti-LogViG, achieves 79.9% average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (std 0.2), which is 1.7% higher than Vision GNN, with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and a 35.3% reduction in GMACs.

Conclusion: LSGC-enabled long-range connectivity can surpass current state-of-the-art Vision GNNs; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

*Deeptimaan Banerjee,Prateek Gothwal,Ashis Kumer Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-MoE model (ExpressNet-MoE) for facial emotion recognition that uses multi-scale feature extraction and a Mixture of Experts to adaptively select relevant features, aiming to improve generalization across datasets; achieves strong results on AffectNet, RAF-DB, and FER-2013 with publicly available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER performance collapses in real-world conditions due to pose, occlusion, illumination, and demographic diversity; existing models struggle with generalization and engagement detection scenarios in education and customer service; a flexible, adaptive architecture could better handle diverse data.

Method: Proposes ExpressNet-MoE, a hybrid architecture that combines multiple CNN-based feature extractors, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module for adaptive feature selection, and a residual network backbone for deep representation learning, with multi-scale feature extraction to capture global and local facial cues; evaluated end-to-end on standard FER datasets.

Result: Achieves 74.77% on AffectNet v7, 72.55% on AffectNet v8, 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013; demonstrates adaptability and improved generalization; provides reproducible code at GitHub.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpressNet-MoE offers an adaptable, end-to-end FER solution that generalizes across multiple datasets and conditions, showing promise for practical deployment in education, healthcare, security, and HCI applications.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

*Junhong Shen,Mu Cai,Bo Hu,Ameet Talwalkar,David A Ross,Cordelia Schmid,Alireza Fathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE introduces derendering to executable code as a verifiable modality for visual reasoning. The framework generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce an image, uses a critic to select and iteratively refine the best reconstruction, turning perceptual tasks into verifiable symbolic ones and enabling precise calculations. It achieves strong improvements on chart/geometry benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with precise reasoning on structured visuals (charts/diagrams) because pixel-based perception lacks verifiability. A symbolic, executable representation can enable verification and precise inference.

Method: RECODE is an agentic framework that (1) generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image, (2) employs a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction, and (3) iteratively refines the code, converting perceptual tasks into verifiable symbolic processes.

Result: On CharXiv, ChartQA, Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms baselines that do not leverage code or use code only for drawing auxiliary lines/cropping, demonstrating the value of code-grounded perception for verifiable reasoning.

Conclusion: Grounding visual perception in executable code enables verifiable, accurate multimodal reasoning and facilitates precise calculations and logical inferences on structured visuals.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 4D fMRI -> 2D flat-map video inputs for ViT using spatiotemporal MAE; trained on 2.3k hours from HCP; data-size follows a strict power-law in performance; representations support cross-subject state decoding and subject-specific trait decoding; open-science foundation-model effort for fMRI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images and develop foundation models for brain imaging; understand how data quantity affects representation learning and transfer across subjects.

Method: Convert 4D fMRI data into 2D flat-map video sequences; train Vision Transformers with a spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) on 2.3k hours from the Human Connectome Project; evaluate on downstream classification tasks measuring state and trait decoding.

Result: Masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size following a strict power scaling law; learned representations support fine-grained state decoding across subjects and subject-specific trait decoding across brain-state changes.

Conclusion: Progress toward foundation models for fMRI with scalable data; code and datasets released to support open science and reproducibility.

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

*Thibault Geoffroy,gauthier Gerspacher,Lionel Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incremental emotion recognition using Action Unit features to curb catastrophic forgetting, achieving 0.75 accuracy on CFEE with a lightweight model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning and the need for semantically meaningful, transferable features in emotion recognition; Action Units offer non-transient, interpretable cues across tasks.

Method: Train on basic emotions, then incrementally incorporate complex/compound emotions. Use Action Units as the primary features, showing they outperform CNN-derived features. Results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Result: Achieves 0.75 accuracy on CFEE; favorable comparison to state-of-the-art results; model is lightweight with small memory usage.

Conclusion: Using AU-based, semantically meaningful features supports robust incremental learning for complex emotions, reducing forgetting and enabling efficient, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

*Maximilian Weiherer,Antonia von Riedheim,Vanessa Brébant,Bernhard Egger,Christoph Palm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Localized implicit breast shape model (liRBSM) using region-local neural SDFs anchored to anatomical landmarks, integrated with a consumer-grade SfM pipeline to reconstruct high-quality 3D breast geometry from monocular RGB video in under six minutes, with error <2 mm; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a low-cost, accessible alternative to expensive 3D breast scanning by leveraging off-the-shelf video and standard SfM, addressing the gap in accurate, metrically-correct breast surface reconstruction.

Method: Develop a parametric 3D breast model with multiple local neural SDFs (localized iRBSM) anchored at anatomical landmarks. Use a standard SfM pipeline to derive geometry from RGB video, mapping to the local SDFs for robust, metric reconstruction and comparing against a global SDF approach (iRBSM).

Result: The localized model yields higher surface detail and accuracy than the global iRBSM, achieving reconstruction errors under 2 mm and completing the process in under six minutes; the pipeline is fast, transparent, and open-source.

Conclusion: Localized implicit modeling significantly improves 3D breast surface reconstruction from monocular video, offering a practical, low-cost solution with public release for researchers and clinicians.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at

*Yi Zhang,Bolin Ni,Xin-Sheng Chen,Heng-Rui Zhang,Yongming Rao,Houwen Peng,Qinglin Lu,Han Hu,Meng-Hao Guo,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Honey-Data-15M: a large 15M QA SFT dataset with dual-level CoT; HoneyPipe/DataStudio data-curation pipeline; Bee-8B trained on it achieves SOTA among fully open MLLMs and rivals some semi-open models; full-stack resources released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open multimodal LLMs lag behind proprietary models largely due to data quality gaps in supervised fine-tuning. Open datasets are noisy and lack complex reasoning data (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), hindering advanced capabilities.

Method: Create Honey-Data-15M by cleaning and enriching ~15M QA pairs with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT strategy. Develop HoneyPipe data-curation pipeline and DataStudio framework for transparent, adaptable curation. Train Bee-8B (8B parameters) on Honey-Data-15M. Provide training recipes, evaluation harness, and model weights.

Result: Bee-8B achieves new state-of-the-art performance among fully open MLLMs, competitive with—often surpassing—recent semi-open models like InternVL3.5-8B.

Conclusion: A principled focus on data quality, supported by a full-stack data curation pipeline and released resources, is a key driver for advancing fully open MLLMs to be competitive with semi-open counterparts.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

*Huawei Sun,Zixu Wang,Xiangyuan Peng,Julius Ott,Georg Stettinger,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XD-RCDepth is a lightweight radar-camera depth estimator that reduces parameters by 29.7% relative to a strong lightweight baseline while maintaining accuracy, enhanced by two distillation strategies—explainability-aligned distillation and depth-distribution distillation—to improve MAE and enable real-time performance on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires robust and accurate depth estimation. Radar-camera fusion provides complementary geometric cues and robustness under adverse conditions. A compact, interpretable model is needed for real-time deployment.

Method: Introduce XD-RCDepth, a lightweight architecture that trims parameters by 29.7% while preserving accuracy. Propose two knowledge-distillation strategies: (1) explainability-aligned distillation that transfers the teacher’s saliency structure to the student to improve interpretability; (2) depth-distribution distillation that casts depth regression as soft classification over discretized depth bins. These strategies work together to preserve performance under compression.

Result: The combination yields a 7.97% MAE improvement over direct training without distillation. The model delivers competitive accuracy with real-time efficiency on the nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets, while maintaining substantially reduced parameters compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that targeted distillation strategies can enhance both accuracy and interpretability of compressed radar-camera depth estimation models, achieving real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

*Xinchen Zhang,Xiaoying Zhang,Youbin Wu,Yanbin Cao,Renrui Zhang,Ruihang Chu,Ling Yang,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose Generative Universal Verifier (GUV) and its ecosystems (ViVerBench, OmniVerifier-7B, and OmniVerifier-TTS) to enable reflection and refinement in multimodal reasoning, achieving notable gains and enabling scalable test-time refinement and broader world-modeling applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models currently lack reliable visual verification during reasoning, leading to gaps between model outputs and real visual outcomes. There is a need for automated data generation, universal visual verification, and test-time refinement to close the performance gap toward human-level reliability.

Method: 1) Build ViVerBench, a 16-category benchmark to evaluate visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. 2) Create two automated pipelines to generate large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier for universal visual verification. 3) Introduce OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that uses the universal verifier to link image generation and editing within unified models, plus analysis of three atomic capabilities and extension to world-modeling interleaved reasoning.

Result: OmniVerifier-7B achieves +8.3 on ViVerBench; OmniVerifier-TTS yields improvements on T2I-ReasonBench (+3.7) and GenEval++ (+4.3), outperforming parallel methods like Best-of-N. The work identifies three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrates their synergistic interactions.

Conclusion: Endowing multimodal reasoning with a universal verifier enables reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, advancing trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems with broader applicability to image generation/editing and world-modeling scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

### [76] [Fusion Meets Diverse Conditions: A High-diversity Benchmark and Baseline for UAV-based Multimodal Object Detection with Condition Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13620)
*Chen Chen,Kangcheng Bin,Ting Hu,Jiahao Qi,Xingyue Liu,Tianpeng Liu,Zhen Liu,Yongxiang Liu,Ping Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new high-diversity UAV RGB-IR dataset (ATR-UMOD) with 6 condition attributes is introduced, and a prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) method is proposed to adaptively fuse multimodal data based on textual condition prompts, with a condition-decoupling module to operate without annotations at test time; experiments show its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV-multimodal datasets and fusion methods struggle to capture real-world variability across diverse imaging conditions (altitude, angle, weather, illumination) and lack robust, condition-aware fusion strategies.

Method: 1) Create ATR-UMOD, a RGB-IR dataset collected from 80–300 m altitude, 0–75° viewing angles, with all-day/all-year variations and 6 annotated condition attributes per image pair. 2) Propose PCDF, which encodes imaging conditions as text prompts to drive a soft-gating mechanism that reweights RGB vs IR contributions. 3) Introduce a prompt-guided condition-decoupling module to enable deployment without condition annotations. 4) Validate on ATR-UMOD showing improved robustness/effectiveness of PCDF.

Result: PCDF effectively models the relationship between imaging conditions and modality contributions, improving robust multimodal fusion under diverse conditions as demonstrated on the ATR-UMOD dataset.

Conclusion: The combination of a diverse UAV RGB-IR dataset and a prompt-guided condition-aware fusion strategy yields robust multimodal detection across variable conditions, with practical applicability thanks to a condition-decoupling module that removes annotation requirements at test time.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

### [77] [AVAR-Net: A Lightweight Audio-Visual Anomaly Recognition Framework with a Benchmark Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13630)
*Amjid Ali,Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan,Altaf Hussain,Muhammad Munsif,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AVAR-Net for robust multimodal anomaly recognition using audio-visual features; introduces VAAR dataset; achieves strong results on VAAR and XD-Violence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overreliance on visual data causes unreliability under occlusion, low light, and adverse weather; lack of large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets hinders multimodal anomaly recognition progress; propose an efficient framework for real-world environments.

Method: Four-module architecture: Wav2Vec2-based audio feature extractor, MobileViT-based video extractor, early fusion, Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) for long-range temporal modeling; end-to-end pipeline; introduction of Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset with 3,000 synchronized video-audio samples across 10 anomaly classes; evaluations on VAAR and XD-Violence.

Result: 89.29% accuracy on VAAR; 88.56% Average Precision on XD-Violence; +2.8 percentage points over state-of-the-art; demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization; positions VAAR as a benchmark.

Conclusion: AVAR-Net is effective and efficient for real-world multimodal anomaly recognition; VAAR provides a valuable benchmark to advance multimodal anomaly recognition research.

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

*Chun Wai Chin,Haniza Yazid,Hoi Leong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISMA-based systematic review of 39 studies on medical image enhancement. Conventional methods predominate, deep learning growing, MRI and multi-modal imaging receive most attention. Highlights evaluation metrics and gaps in underexplored modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address noise, artifacts, and low contrast in medical imaging and to evaluate how enhancement methods are assessed across modalities using diverse IQA metrics.

Method: PRISMA-guided systematic review of 39 peer-reviewed studies, classifying techniques as 29 conventional, 9 deep learning, and 1 hybrid; analyzing imaging modalities and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics; synthesizing limitations and future directions.

Result: Key challenges include low contrast and noise; MRI and multi-modal imaging are most studied; specialized modalities like histopathology, endoscopy, and bone scintigraphy are underexplored; 65 IQA metrics introduced (mostly non-reference-based); 18 studies use both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 use reference-based only, 12 use non-reference-based only.

Conclusion: The review identifies current limitations and research gaps, and outlines potential directions for advancing medical image enhancement, including diversifying modalities studied and standardizing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

### [79] [Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13643)
*Akib Mohammed Khan,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGDIv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors (AnomalyDINO) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and their anomaly scores are poorly calibrated; applying post-hoc Platt scaling improves calibration and enables detection of adversarial inputs via increased predictive entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand robustness of foundation-model–based few-shot anomaly detectors to adversarial perturbations and to assess whether their anomaly scores provide calibrated uncertainty, addressing safety-critical deployment concerns.

Method: Attach a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features to enable white-box gradient attacks. Use FGSM to craft perturbations on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets. Evaluate performance (F1, AUROC, AP, G-mean). Apply post-hoc Platt scaling to anomaly scores for uncertainty estimation. Compare calibrated vs. raw scores in terms of entropy and calibration error (ECE).

Result: FGSM perturbations consistently degrade detection metrics (F1, AUROC, AP, G-mean). Raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated. Platt scaling yields calibrated posteriors with higher entropy on adversarial inputs, enabling attack flagging and reducing ECE. Establishes evaluation protocol and a simple baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are essential for trustworthy, real-world deployment of anomaly detectors based on foundation models; the proposed baseline (Platt-calibrated scores) offers a practical step toward reliability and safety.

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

*Sanchar Palit,Subhasis Chaudhuri,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based super-resolution framework that uses Local-Global Context-Aware Attention and pixel-space distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning to produce high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions that are structurally consistent with the original content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained text-to-image diffusion models are powerful but can fail on diverse, highly degraded images—causing noise amplification or incorrect content. There is a need to preserve both local pixel relationships and global structure while maintaining perceptual fidelity in SR tasks.

Method: Introduce Local-Global Context-Aware Attention to maintain local and global pixel relationships, and a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to capture fine-grained representations and progressively refine structural information from local details to global composition. The method leverages pretrained text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for SR, and improves inference to generate content-consistent, artifact-free reconstructions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate improved fidelity and perceptual accuracy, with reduced artifacts and better structural consistency compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively preserves local and global content, enhances perceptual fidelity, and yields high-quality, structurally consistent SR results across diverse degraded inputs, indicating strong potential for diffusion-based SR methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

*Huaizhi Qu,Ruichen Zhang,Shuqing Luo,Luchao Qi,Zhihao Zhang,Xiaoming Liu,Roni Sengupta,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditCast3D uses video-generation foundation models to propagate a single-frame edit across a dataset for 3D reconstruction, augmented with a view-selection strategy to ensure consistency and enable fast, refinement-free reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models enable powerful image/video editing but are expensive or restricted; naive per-frame edits harm multi-view consistency and require costly refinement. A dataset-level, efficient 3D editing approach is needed.

Method: Propagate edits from a first frame to the entire dataset using video-generation models; introduce a view-selection mechanism to identify consistent and reconstruction-friendly views; perform feedforward reconstruction without expensive per-frame refinement; reduce reliance on costly image editing and API constraints.

Result: Empirical evaluation on standard 3D editing benchmarks shows EditCast3D achieves higher editing quality and efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: EditCast3D offers a scalable, general approach for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines, with code available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

*Hongyu Qu,Jianan Wei,Xiangbo Shu,Yazhou Yao,Wenguan Wang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniGaze is a semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation leveraging large-scale unlabeled data with a reward-based pseudo-labeling scheme and multimodal cues to improve cross-domain generalization and enable zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D gaze estimation suffers from limited annotated data and domain bias; unlabeled data from diverse real-world environments can broaden the training distribution and improve generalization.

Method: Collect diverse unlabeled facial images; perform pseudo-labeling of 3D gaze directions; use a reward model incorporating visual embeddings and semantic cues from a Multimodal LLM to score pseudo-label reliability; select high-quality pseudo labels and weight them during training; train to predict 3D gaze including direction vectors, leveraging unlabeled data to reduce domain bias; evaluate on five datasets (in-domain and cross-domain) and test zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain settings; demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: OmniGaze effectively leverages unlabeled data to generalize 3D gaze estimation in the wild and can serve as a scalable data engine for gaze estimation.

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

### [84] [Seeing and Knowing in the Wild: Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition with Large-scale Knowledge Graphs via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13675)
*Hongkuan Zhou,Lavdim Halilaj,Sebastian Monka,Stefan Schmid,Yuqicheng Zhu,Jingcheng Wu,Nadeem Nazer,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KnowCoL: a knowledge-guided contrastive learning framework that aligns images and text in a Wikidata-grounded semantic space for open-domain visual entity recognition, achieving strong unseen-entity performance with a compact model on OVEN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-domain visual recognition must handle open-set, long-tail concepts with limited supervision and semantic ambiguity. Wikidata provides rich structured knowledge (descriptions, hierarchies, relations) to support disambiguation and zero-shot recognition.

Method: Train a shared semantic space for visual and textual inputs grounded in Wikidata, leveraging entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context. Use contrastive learning to align multimodal representations and enable zero-shot entity recognition on OVEN (Wikidata ID label space). Evaluate a range of model sizes, reporting improvements for unseen entities.

Result: Incorporating visual, textual, and structured knowledge yields higher accuracy, particularly for rare and unseen entities. The smallest model improves unseen-entity accuracy by 10.5% over the state of the art, while being 35x smaller.

Conclusion: Knowledge-guided multimodal learning with structured knowledge from Wikidata effectively supports open-domain visual entity recognition, especially for unseen concepts, and offers a scalable and efficient approach with room for expanding knowledge sources and grounding.

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

### [85] [FlashWorld: High-quality 3D Scene Generation within Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13678)
*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld is a fast 3D scene generator that outputs multi-view-consistent 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt, achieved by a dual-mode diffusion model with cross-mode distillation, bridging MV-oriented and 3D-oriented paradigms for high-quality results at 10–100x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing trade-off between MV-oriented approaches (which optimize multi-view consistency by reconstructing 3D from multiple views) and 3D-oriented approaches (which directly generate 3D representations but often suffer from lower visual quality). The goal is to deliver fast, high-quality, 3D scene generation from minimal input while ensuring 3D consistency and broad generalization.

Method: 1) Pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model that supports both MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation. 2) Use a cross-mode post-training distillation to align the distribution of the 3D-oriented mode with the high-quality MV-oriented mode, improving visual quality and 3D consistency while reducing denoising steps. 3) Leverage video diffusion priors and large-scale single-view images/text prompts to enhance generalization to out-of-distribution inputs.

Result: Empirical results show FlashWorld achieves 10–100× speedups over prior methods with superior rendering quality, maintains 3D consistency, and reduces inference denoising steps. The approach also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FlashWorld successfully bridges MV-oriented and 3D-oriented paradigms via dual-mode pre-training and cross-mode distillation, delivering fast, high-quality 3D scene generation from images or prompts, while improving 3D consistency and generalization.

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

### [86] [Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684)
*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) can generate healthy counterfactuals of pathology images by conditioning on both a healthy initial image and a synthetic pathological final image, improving anatomical preservation and pathology removal, outperforming previous diffusion and supervised methods in segmentation and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable analysis tools designed for healthy scans and anomaly detection by producing plausible, subject-specific healthy counterfactuals from pathological images. The challenge is to remove pathology while preserving individual anatomy, a balance difficult for existing diffusion models trained only on healthy data or guided by synthetic pathology.

Method: Apply denoising diffusion bridge models that condition the diffusion process on a pair: the healthy source image and a final synthetic pathological image. Treat the pathological image as a structurally informative prior to steer generation toward a plausible healthy counterfactual that retains subject-specific features while removing pathology.

Result: The DDBM approach outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised methods on segmentation and anomaly detection tasks, producing accurate healthy counterfactuals that preserve anatomy while removing pathology.

Conclusion: Conditioning diffusion on both the healthy and final pathological endpoints provides a principled prior for generating healthy counterfactuals, yielding better balance between anomaly removal and anatomical preservation and improving downstream segmentation and anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS) to enhance cross-modal attention toward safety-critical image regions, enabling fast, query-level risk assessment and safe, helpful responses without iterative output adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety in multimodal AI: models are vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts, safety training is costly, and existing inference-time defenses can cause excessive refusals and slowdowns. A need for efficient, reliable risk assessment at inference time.

Method: Reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, use the assessed risk to adaptively steer activations, and generate safe, helpful responses without iterative adjustments.

Result: RAS substantially reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance, and improves inference speed compared with prior inference-time defenses across multiple multimodal safety/utility benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAS offers an effective, efficient inference-time safety mechanism for multimodal models by aligning activations to safety-critical regions based on query-level risk, reducing harm while maintaining utility.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

*Fabio Musio,Norman Juchler,Kaiyuan Yang,Suprosanna Shit,Chinmay Prabhakar,Bjoern Menze,Sven Hirsch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thinning-based skeletonization to extract Circle of Willis centerlines from TopCoW; combines U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection to produce accurate centerline graphs and robust morphometric features; evaluation shows anatomical plausibility and dataset release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome difficulties in reliable centerline extraction due to CoW geometry and lack of public datasets; enable automated CoW assessment via centerlines and features.

Method: Apply thinning-based skeletonization to 200 TopCoW stroke patients with MRA and CTA; train/use a U-Net to generate skeletons, connect them with A* to form centerline graphs; extract features (radius, length, bifurcation ratios); evaluate on held-out data and analyze downstream tasks.

Result: Graph topology reconstructed with high accuracy (F1=1); average node distance <1 voxel; median relative errors <5%; Pearson correlations >0.95 for features.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the value of learning-based skeletonization with graph connection for plausible CoW centerlines; highlights importance of anatomical accuracy and feature robustness; dataset and baseline released for further research.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiFMCR introduces a dual-camera light field registration dataset with synchronized MLA-based cameras and 6-DoF ground-truth poses, plus baselines (RANSAC cross-view alignment and plenoptic PnP) that leverage the plenoptic camera model for accurate multi-view registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration by providing synchronized data and precise external ground truth, addressing limitations of single-camera datasets lacking GT.

Method: Dataset: synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras with 6-DoF poses from a Vicon system. Baselines: (i) RANSAC-based robust 3D transformation estimation using cross-view point clouds; (ii) plenoptic PnP estimating extrinsic 6-DoF from single light field images. Both include the plenoptic camera model.

Result: Experiments show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view light field processing.

Conclusion: LiFMCR provides a valuable benchmark and baseline methods for evaluating multi-camera light field registration and enables rigorous multi-view processing of light fields; project page provided.

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

### [90] [Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735)
*Zhenxuan Zhang,Peiyuan Jing,Zi Wang,Ula Briski,Coraline Beitone,Yue Yang,Yinzhe Wu,Fanwen Wang,Liutao Yang,Jiahao Huang,Zhifan Gao,Zhaolin Chen,Kh Tohidul Islam,Guang Yang,Peter J. Lally*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cycle-consistent diffusion framework (CSS-Diff) for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI, featuring a cycle constraint, a slice-wise gap perception module with contrastive learning, and a local structure correction module, achieving state-of-the-art quantitative metrics and improved anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI offers cost, accessibility, and safety advantages but suffers from low resolution and poor SNR. Translating to high-field MRI is clinically desirable but often introduces fidelity gaps in anatomy and contrast; preserving anatomical fidelity while bridging domain gaps is essential for reliable synthesis.

Method: Proposes CSS-Diff, a diffusion-based synthesis method with cycle-consistency constraints to preserve anatomy during generation. It includes two novel components: (1) a slice-wise gap perception network that aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning, and (2) a local structure correction network that enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked/perturbed patches.

Result: Experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks show state-of-the-art performance (e.g., PSNR 31.80 ± 2.70, SSIM 0.943 ± 0.102, LPIPS 0.0864 ± 0.0689). Anatomical fidelity improves, with left cerebral white matter error dropping from 12.1% to 2.1% and cortex error from 4.2% to 3.7%. The method yields images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.

Conclusion: CSS-Diff can synthesize high-field MRI from low-field data with strong quantitative accuracy and preserved anatomical structures, reducing the need for costly data and bridging domain gaps in image contrast.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

*Tianshuo Xu,Kai Wang,Zhifei Chen,Leyi Wu,Tianshui Wen,Fei Chao,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli is a diffusion-based framework that jointly learns column-level recognition and generation for Chinese calligraphy, tying recognition and style/layout generation together to improve both tasks, with a new dataset and cross-script applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either produce high-quality isolated characters while missing page-level aesthetics or synthesize pages but sacrifice calligraphic accuracy. A unified, jointly trained approach could leverage mutual feedback to improve both recognition and generation, especially in limited-data regimes.

Method: Propose UniCalli, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Train recognition and generation jointly so the generator preserves character structure and the recognizer benefits from generated layouts. Use asymmetric noise and a rasterized box map as spatial priors. Train on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. Curate a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces (≈4,000 densely annotated). Extendable to other scripts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with improved ligature continuity and layout fidelity, and stronger recognition. Demonstrates robustness in limited-data regimes and generalizes to other ancient scripts (Oracle bone inscriptions, Egyptian hieroglyphs). Code and data are available online.

Conclusion: Joint recognition-generation with spatial priors fosters concept-level abstractions that benefit both tasks, yielding better page-level calligraphy synthesis without compromising character accuracy, and enabling cross-script applicability.

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified 4–8B parameter omni-modal LLM (InteractiveOmni) for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, built by integrating vision, audio, LLM, and speech decoder, trained in multi-stage fashion, with multi-turn memory benchmarks; it outperforms open-source peers, with 4B rivaling larger models and achieving strong memory and generation across modalities, all open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for lightweight yet capable omni-modal models that can actively understand and reason across vision, audio, and language in multi-turn interactions, including long-term memory. Open-source, scalable solutions with strong memory and generation across modalities are highly valuable for research and deployment.

Method: - Build a unified model that fuses a vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder. - Employ a multi-stage training strategy: pre-train for omni-modal understanding, then post-train with speech conversations and audio-visual interactions. - Curate a multi-turn training dataset to enhance long-term conversational ability. - Create evaluation benchmarks for multi-modal multi-turn memory and multi-turn speech interaction to measure memory and speech capabilities.

Result: InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models in multi-turn audio-visual tasks, with strong long-term memory. The 4B variant InteractiveOmni-4B approaches the performance of the 7B+ model Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and can retain about 97% of the 8B model’s performance while using only 50% of the size. It achieves state-of-the-art results among similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation, positioning it as a capable, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni offers an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems, delivering strong cross-modal understanding and long-term multi-turn memory, with competitive performance at lightweight model scales.

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks treat vision understanding and generation in isolation or ignore tasks that inherently couple them. There is a need to systematically study how these abilities reinforce one another in unified models.

Method: Introduce Uni-MMMU with eight reasoning-centered tasks where each task is bidirectionally coupled. Models must use conceptual understanding to guide visual synthesis or use generation to support analytical reasoning. The benchmark includes verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Extensive evaluation compares unified, generation-only, and understanding-only models.

Result: The evaluation uncovers substantial performance disparities between model types and unveils cross-modal dependencies. It demonstrates how generation and understanding reinforce each other in certain scenarios and provides a robust foundation for evaluating and advancing unified multimodal models.

Conclusion: Uni-MMMU offers a reliable and discipline-aware foundation for developing and evaluating truly integrated multimodal models, clarifying when and how generation and understanding should cooperate across diverse domains.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

### [94] [Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787)
*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVC adapts diffusion-based story continuation by using CLIP-based retrieval to reuse prior frames when relevant and limiting prior influence when not, improving coherence and fidelity; enhanced supervision via LLM-based captioning; outperforms baselines, especially with conflicting visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core challenge in story continuation is leveraging prior visual context while maintaining semantic alignment with the current textual input; naive conditioning can inject misleading information from past frames, harming coherence.

Method: Introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual Conditioning) for diffusion-based story continuation. Use CLIP to retrieve the most semantically aligned previous frame; if no sufficiently relevant image is found, adaptively restrict the influence of prior visuals to the early steps of diffusion. Also improve textual supervision by re-captioning a noisy dataset with large language models. Evaluate with quantitative metrics and human judgments.

Result: AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared with strong baselines, especially in scenarios where prior visuals conflict with the current input.

Conclusion: Adaptive visual conditioning enables diffusion models to leverage visual context when beneficial while avoiding misleading priors, and enhanced captions further strengthen semantic alignment, yielding more coherent and faithful story continuations.

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Method: Embed a watermark by tying the diffusion's initial seed (noise) to a hash-modulated sampling process, making seed recovery and substitution infeasible; prove authorship via zero-knowledge proofs without revealing the seed; verify using only the seed and the content, independent of model weights.

Result: Demonstrates NoisePrints across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos with efficient verification that relies solely on the seed and output, without model weights.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable watermarking approach for diffusion models that enables robust, privacy-preserving ownership verification and reduces barriers to provenance authentication.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

### [96] [Reasoning in Space via Grounding in the World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13800)
*Yiming Chen,Zekun Qi,Wenyao Zhang,Xin Jin,Li Zhang,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-contained 3D LLM, GS-Reasoner, with a dual-path pooling to fuse semantic, geometric, and positional cues into a unified patch-based 3D representation, enabling autoregressive grounding without external modules; coupled with the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding and enhanced spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D LLMs lack a unified 3D representation that jointly encodes semantic and geometric information, leading to weak grounding or over-reliance on external tools and hindering seamless grounding-spatial reasoning integration.

Method: Introduce a dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with semantic and positional cues to form a single image patch-based 3D representation without increasing input tokens; enable autoregressive grounding without external modules; curate the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset with 3D bounding boxes and step-by-step grounding-centric reasoning paths.

Result: GS-Reasoner achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on 3D visual grounding and substantially improves spatial reasoning; demonstrates fully autoregressive grounding without external modules; GCoT dataset supports the integrated grounding-and-reasoning approach and validates performance gains.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified, self-contained framework for 3D spatial reasoning; the dual-path representation and the GCoT dataset offer a pathway toward tighter integration of grounding and reasoning in 3D LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

### [97] [Trace Anything: Representing Any Video in 4D via Trajectory Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13802)
*Xinhang Liu,Yuxi Xiao,Donny Y. Chen,Jiashi Feng,Yu-Wing Tai,Chi-Keung Tang,Bingyi Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Trajectory Field representation for videos and a one-pass neural network, Trace Anything, that predicts per-pixel 3D trajectories via B-spline control points; achieves state-of-the-art on a new trajectory-field benchmark, is competitive elsewhere, and enables emergent skills with efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture continuous spatio-temporal dynamics at the pixel level (3D trajectories) and overcome per-pixel optimization limits by providing a dense, predictive, and efficient representation through a single forward pass.

Method: Represent a video as a dense Trajectory Field mapping each pixel to a time-parametric 3D trajectory. Introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that outputs per-pixel B-spline control points, enabling 3D positions at arbitrary times. Train on large-scale 4D data, including a new platform, leveraging a one-pass inference paradigm.

Result: Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new trajectory-field benchmark and is competitive on established point-tracking benchmarks. It delivers significant efficiency gains by avoiding iterative optimization and auxiliary estimators, and exhibits emergent abilities such as goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Conclusion: The trajectory-field paradigm and Trace Anything offer an effective, efficient framework for comprehensive spatio-temporal video understanding, with promising emergent capabilities and potential for broad applicability and future research directions.

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

### [98] [VisCoP: Visual Probing for Video Domain Adaptation of Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13808)
*Dominick Reilly,Manish Kumar Govind,Le Xue,Srijan Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisCoP adds a compact set of learnable visual probes to a vision encoder, enabling efficient, parameter-efficient domain adaptation for Vision-Language Models. It achieves strong target-domain performance while preserving source-domain knowledge, outperforming existing methods across diverse domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs perform well on general tasks but suffer sharp performance drops under distribution shifts. Fine-tuning components often yields limited domain-specific learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior capabilities. A lightweight, parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism is needed to adapt to new domains without erasing prior knowledge.

Method: Introduce Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP) by augmenting the vision encoder with a compact set of learnable visual probes. These probes enable domain-specific feature learning with minimal modification to pretrained parameters, providing contextualized visual representations that adapt to target domains.

Result: Across three challenging domain-adaptation settings—cross-view (exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human understanding to robot control)—VisCoP consistently outperforms existing adaptation strategies, delivering superior target-domain performance while retaining source-domain knowledge.

Conclusion: VisCoP offers a simple, effective, and parameter-efficient approach to domain adaptation for VLMs, generalizing across views, modalities, and tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving broad capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

*Sihui Ji,Xi Chen,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysMaster introduces PhysEncoder to inject physical priors into video generation, trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (Direct Preference Optimization) to enhance physics-awareness, aiming to be a plug-in generic solution for physics-aware video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation often produces visually realistic outputs but lacks adherence to physical laws; there is a need for physics-aware world models and priors, with supervision beyond appearance.

Method: Treats video generation as image-to-video task; uses PhysEncoder to extract and supply physical information from the input image as an extra conditioning signal; applies reinforcement learning with human feedback (DPO) to learn physical representations end-to-end.

Result: Shows a feasible approach to improve physics-awareness, validated on a simple proxy task, and claims generalizability to diverse physical scenarios, positioning PhysMaster as a plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation.

Conclusion: PhysMaster unifies representation learning for physical processes within an RL framework to enable broad, plug-in improvements in physics-aware video generation and related applications.

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Train robotic grasping on randomly assembled toy objects made from four primitives, enabling strong zero-shot generalization to real-world objects with a 67% grasp success on YCB; key idea is an object-centric representation from a detection pooling mechanism; scalable using varying toy diversity and demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to generalize grasping to novel objects. Cognitive science suggests generalizable skills can be learned from simple toys. This work investigates whether similar toy-based generalization can transfer to real-world manipulation.

Method: Train grasping policies on randomly assembled objects composed of spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. Introduce a detection-pooling module to produce object-centric visual representations. Evaluate in simulation and on physical robots, measuring zero-shot transfer to real-world objects (YCB). Systematically vary the number/diversity of training toys and demonstrations per toy.

Result: Achieves 67% real-world grasping success on the YCB dataset in zero-shot transfer, outperforming state-of-the-art methods that use more in-domain data. Demonstrates robust generalization driven by the object-centric representation. Provides analysis on how performance scales with toy diversity and demonstrations.

Conclusion: Toy-based training with a detection-pooling induced object-centric representation offers a scalable path to generalizable robotic manipulation, enabling strong zero-shot performance with limited in-domain data. Resources (videos, code, dataset) are provided on the project page.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration

### [101] [Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces as Control Barrier Functions for Safe Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12919)
*Mouhyemen Khan,Tatsuya Ibuki,Abhijit Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified GPIS-based approach to synthesize Gaussian CBFs, with a sparse variant to scale, validated on 7-DOF manipulator and quadrotor for collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine level-set safety methods with implicit surface representations using Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPIS). Leverage GP uncertainty to provide robust safety margins and address GP scalability with a sparse solution.

Method: Condition the GPIS on sensor-derived safety samples to produce a GP posterior. The posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface (safety belief) and the posterior variance provides a safety margin. Introduce sparse Gaussian CBFs to reduce cubic computational cost. Validate on collision avoidance tasks for a simulated 7-DOF manipulator around the Stanford bunny and a quadrotor around a physical chair.

Result: Gaussian CBFs, with and without sparsity, enable safe interaction and collision-free trajectories that would otherwise intersect objects in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The implicit surface-as-CBF via GPIS is a viable, uncertainty-aware framework for safety-critical robotic planning, with sparsity offering scalable computation for larger systems.

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GMPPI is a geometric SE(3)-aware, sampling-based MPC for UAVs that improves agile tracking and obstacle avoidance, outperforming MPPI and enabling high-speed operation with a stereo camera.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, obstacle-aware autonomous UAV flight in cluttered environments by combining geometric SE(3) control with MPPI and online sensing.

Method: Generate many rollout trajectories; use geometric SE(3) to generate part of rollouts; vary rollout step length and dynamic cost/noise; integrate stereo depth camera for online obstacle avoidance; average rollouts to form nominal control; evaluate in simulation and real-world experiments.

Result: Matches geometric SE(3) tracking error; avoids obstacles in simulation up to 13 m/s; real-world experiments up to 10 m/s; outperforms state-of-the-art obstacle-aware planner in simulation.

Conclusion: GMPPI extends MPPI with geometry-aware planning, enabling high-speed, obstacle-avoiding UAV flight in complex environments; validated in both simulation and real-world tests.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

*Michal Minařík,Vojtěch Vonásek,Robert Pěnička*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A library of past 6D path plans for solid objects is reused to accelerate planning for new, similar objects by using approximate paths and adapting them to new configurations, improving performance in narrow passages and often solving cases where traditional planners fail; open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce planning time and increase robustness in 3D rigid-object motion planning by reusing past experiences across similar objects, addressing the difficulty of narrow passages and the inefficiency of starting planning from scratch for each object in environments like bin-picking.

Method: Build a library of solved paths for various objects. When planning for a new object, select the most similar object from the library and use its path as an approximate solution, adjusting for potential mutual transformations. Sample the configuration space along these approximate paths to guide planning. Compare against OMPL planners in narrow passages and evaluate speedups.

Result: Significant speedups reported (up to 85% reduction in planning time). The method often finds solutions where other planners fail in narrow passages. The authors released an open-source implementation.

Conclusion: Experience-based reuse of past path solutions enables faster and more robust planning for 3D solid objects in 6D configuration spaces, especially in environments with narrow passages; open-source release facilitates adoption and further research.

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

TL;DR: Omega turns for elongate limbless robots are achieved by prescribing the omega turn as a superposition of two traveling waves, enabling robust turning in cluttered environments, and generalizing to elongate multi-legged robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elongate limbless robots require robust, effective turning in tight, cluttered spaces for search-and-rescue and industrial inspection; current turning strategies are limited; insights from C. elegans omega turns inspire a wave-based approach.

Method: Propose omega turn as a superposition of two traveling waves guided by wave equations; design a controller for limbless robots to execute this turning; validate in lab and cluttered field; test generalization to elongate multi-legged robots.

Result: Demonstrates robust and effective turning in laboratory and cluttered environments; omega turn controllers generalize to elongate multi-legged robots; demonstrates a body-driven turning strategy for elongated robots with and without limbs.

Conclusion: A wave-based prescription of omega turns provides a general, robust turning strategy for elongate robots, transferable to multi-legged designs and cluttered environments.

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Motivation: To enable transferable 6-DoF robotic manipulation with minimal human data by extracting actionable cues (geometry, appearance, affordances) from uncalibrated RGB videos of humans, thereby building a reusable skill memory.

Method: Introduce a Neural Affordance Function (NAF) as an object-centric representation that distills geometry, appearance, and affordances from diverse uncalibrated videos into a lightweight neural network forming a memory bank of manipulation skills. During deployment, retrieve relevant affordance functions and transfer 6-DoF policies via coarse-to-fine optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded in the neural functions.

Conclusion: Actron3D enables efficient transfer of manipulation skills from minimal human data, demonstrating strong cross-task performance and practical potential for real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only

object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UNCAP enables scalable, safe cooperative planning for connected autonomous vehicles by using uncertainty-aware, lightweight natural language messages within a two-stage communication protocol, achieving substantial bandwidth reductions and safety gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAV coordination either relies on high-bandwidth raw sensor data or ignores perception/perception uncertainties, hindering scalability and safety. There is a need for efficient, interpretable communication that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in shared data.

Method: Two-stage protocol: (i) the ego vehicle selects the subset of other vehicles most relevant for information exchange; (ii) the selected vehicles transmit messages expressed in natural language that quantitatively describe their perception uncertainty. Messages are fused by selecting signals that maximize mutual information to improve decision-making, leveraging vision-language model-based planning.

Result: The approach yields a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth, a 31% improvement in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided natural language communication enables scalable and reliable cooperative planning for CAVs by combining interpretable messaging with uncertainty-aware decision-making, showing strong potential for safer, bandwidth-efficient multi-vehicle coordination.

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a ground-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed to emulate In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) using a 6-DOF UR3e arm mounted on a satellite bus with a 1-DOF guide rail, enabling validation of space-motion, serial manipulation, and contact dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAM operations on satellites involve complex 6-DOF dynamics and perturbations that are difficult to test on-orbit; there is a need for experimentally validated models of space motion, robotic manipulation, and contact interactions.

Method: Develop a hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup in which a 6-DOF UR3e robotic arm is mounted on a satellite bus, which is itself mounted on a 1-DOF guide-rail to allow constrained linear motion, enabling ground-based emulation of ISAM scenarios and testing of dynamical/models related to space motion, manipulation, and contact mechanics.

Result: The abstract presents design and development of the HIL testbed but does not report empirical results; it outlines the system and its intended validation capabilities for space-motion, manipulation, and contact dynamics.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that this HIL emulation system will enable exploration and validation of ISAM models related to space motion, serial manipulation, and contact mechanics.

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

*Minghao Guo,Victor Zordan,Sheldon Andrews,Wojciech Matusik,Maneesh Agrawala,Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An automatic framework that synthesizes functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models, optimizing spatial placements to ensure sound attachments over motion and to meet user-defined functional goals, via a kinematics-aware attachment energy and an annealed Riemannian Langevin sampler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid, functional assembly of articulated assets by reusing existing parts, bridging geometry-aware matching with functionality-driven design, and improving over baselines in geometric, kinematic, and functional metrics.

Method: Given a kinematic graph and a small set of articulated parts, jointly optimize the placement of each part so attachments stay geometrically valid across motion and the assembled object achieves specified goals (e.g., collision-free actuation, reachability, trajectory following). Use a kinematics-aware attachment energy based on vector distance function features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. Solve with an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that treats functionality objectives as energies, enabling robust global search and handling non-differentiable constraints.

Result: The method yields diverse assembled articulated shapes (e.g., trash-can wheels on car bodies, multi-segment lamps, gear-driven paddlers, reconfigurable furniture) and shows strong quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric, kinematic, and functional metrics.

Conclusion: By tightly coupling articulation-aware geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, the framework bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, enabling rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

*Ankit Goyal,Hugo Hadfield,Xuning Yang,Valts Blukis,Fabio Ramos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A simple text-based action representation (VLA-0) for Vision-Language-Action models achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIBERO and strong real-world results, despite no specialized action tokens or heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether representing actions as plain text—without modifying VLM vocab or adding action heads—can match or exceed more complex VLA designs, reducing architectural complexity and data requirements.

Method: Introduce VLA-0 by encoding actions as textual prompts within a VLA framework. Identify design choices and training techniques that unlock high performance (e.g., prompt design, alignment strategies, data handling) to enable effective grounding of actions in language-visual priors.

Result: On LIBERO, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data (e.g., pi_0.5-KI, OpenVLA-OFT, SmolVLA) and even surpasses some models trained on large-scale robotic data (e.g., pi_0.5-KI, pi_0, GR00T-N1, MolmoAct). In real-world tests, it outperforms SmolVLA pre-trained on large-scale real data.

Conclusion: Text-only action representations can be surprisingly powerful for VLAs when paired with the right design, challenging the need for action-specific vocabularies or heads and suggesting a simpler, data-efficient path to strong robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

*Yangtao Chen,Zixuan Chen,Nga Teng Chan,Junting Chen,Junhui Yin,Jieqi Shi,Yang Gao,Yong-Lu Li,Jing Huo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboHiMan presents a hierarchical evaluation framework and HiMan-Bench to study compositional generalization and robustness in long-horizon robotic manipulation, revealing gaps in current models and guiding planning–execution improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for models that can flexibly schedule and compose learned skills under diverse perturbations and across long horizons, beyond what end-to-end or current hierarchical methods achieve, and existing benchmarks inadequately probe compositional generalization and planning–execution dynamics.

Method: Introduce RoboHiMan with HiMan-Bench containing atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations, plus a multi-level training dataset for progressive data scaling, and three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled) to analyze skill composition and bottlenecks in hierarchical architectures.

Result: Experiments show clear capability gaps across representative models and architectures, highlighting bottlenecks in hierarchical approaches and underscoring the need for models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation; benchmarks and evaluation protocols reveal where planning and execution diverge and where compositional generalization fails.

Conclusion: RoboHiMan provides a systematic platform to study compositional generalization in long-horizon manipulation, enabling more robust planning–execution architectures and offering datasets, protocols, and code to drive progress in this area.

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

TL;DR: ALOHA2 is a dual-arm teleoperation robot that improves on the original ALOHA with higher performance, robustness, and ergonomics. It retains a two-gripper end-effector setup and includes two ViperX 6-DoF arms and two smaller WidowX arms.

featuring higher performance and robustness compared to the original design,
while also being more ergonomic. Like ALOHA, ALOHA2 consists of two grippers
and two ViperX 6-DoF arms, as well as two smaller WidowX arms. Users control
the follower mechanical arms by operating the leader mechanical arms through
back-driving. The device also includes cameras that generate images from

### [112] [DAMM-LOAM: Degeneracy Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13287)
*Nishant Chandna,Akshat Kaushal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAMM-LOAM introduces degeneracy-aware LiDAR odometry by classifying points into surface-based categories, using a degeneracy-weighted ICP for pose estimation, and employing a Scan Context loop-closure backend to improve mapping, especially in indoor scenarios with sparse/repetitive features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-only SLAM struggles with pose estimation degeneracy in sparse features, repetitive structures, and high-frequency motion. Existing methods often rely on extra sensing modalities; a robust LiDAR-only solution is needed to improve 6-DOF pose accuracy and mapping reliability.

Method: 1) Classify point clouds into ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar using surface normals and neighborhood analysis to establish more reliable correspondences. 2) Apply a degeneracy-based weighted least squares ICP to estimate odometry, mitigating degeneracy in uncertain directions. 3) Use a Scan Context based back-end to enable robust loop closures.

Result: DAMM-LOAM achieves significant improvements in odometry accuracy, particularly in indoor environments (e.g., long corridors), by improving data association and loop-closure robustness.

Conclusion: A degeneracy-aware multi-metric LiDAR odometry and mapping framework (DAMM-LOAM) can substantially enhance LiDAR-only SLAM performance in challenging environments by leveraging surface-based classifications, degeneracy-aware optimization, and a scan-context loop-closure backend.

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

### [113] [Tactile-Conditioned Diffusion Policy for Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13324)
*Erik Helmut,Niklas Funk,Tim Schneider,Cristiana de Farias,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM) introduces a diffusion-based imitation learning framework that uses tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, enabling a force-based action space for manipulation; demonstrates superior performance across force-demanding tasks and provides open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of explicit force control in imitation learning, especially for fragile or deformable objects, by leveraging high-dimensional tactile sensing to ground force decisions.

Method: Collect demonstrations with a GelSight Mini-tactile sensor on a handheld UMI gripper; train a diffusion-based FARM policy to jointly predict pose, grip width, and grip force; deploy using an actuated UMI gripper with matching geometry; operate in a force-grounded action space conditioned on tactile input.

Result: Outperforms baselines across three tasks with high, low, and dynamic force requirements, validating the benefits of tactile-grounded observations and a force-based control space.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile information to infer force signals improves manipulation performance; the approach is open-source and ready for replication and further study.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced
and available at https://tactile-farm.github.io .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MODUR introduces dual-level reconfiguration in Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robots: high-level reconfiguration among modules plus per-module shape change using compact connectors and scissor-linkage actuators, forming a parallel mechanism for decoupled connector motion and adjacent position migration; workspace analysis and experimental validation underpin the design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance adaptability and robustness of MSRRs by integrating reconfigurable mechanisms at both the module and system level, enabling versatile configurations and basic motions across varying environments.

Method: Design of MODUR with a compact connector and scissor linkage groups that actuate a parallel mechanism, enabling connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration; theoretical workspace analysis accounting for interdependent connectors; experimental validation of MODUR motion.

Result: MODUR demonstrates dual-level reconfiguration: high-level module reconfiguration to form different configurations and per-module shape change for basic motions; the parallel mechanism achieves motion decoupling and position migration; workspace analysis supports the design, and experiments validate motion.

Conclusion: MODUR offers a theoretical and experimental foundation for dual-level MSRRs, enabling flexible configurations and motion. The approach enhances adaptability and robustness by integrating reconfigurable mechanisms at both module and system levels.

Abstract: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent
connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for
the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is
validated through a series of experiments.

*Shingo Ayabe,Hiroshi Kera,Kazuhiko Kawamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline-to-online adversarial fine-tuning improves robustness to action-space perturbations for offline-trained policies, using a performance-aware, EMA-based curriculum to balance robustness with nominal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL is sample-efficient but policies trained on static data are brittle to actuator faults and action perturbations. There is a need to enable online adaptability without sacrificing offline efficiency.

Method: Train on clean data offline, then perform adversarial fine-tuning by injecting perturbations into executed actions to elicit compensatory behavior. Use a performance-aware curriculum with an exponential-moving-average (EMA) signal to adjust perturbation probability during training. Evaluate on continuous-control locomotion tasks and compare to offline-only baselines and scratch training.

Result: Robustness to action-space perturbations improves over offline-only baselines and converges faster than training from scratch. Aligning fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields strongest robustness; the EMA-based curriculum prevents nominal performance degradation observed with a linear curriculum.

Conclusion: Adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive, robust control under uncertainty, bridging offline data efficiency with online adaptability.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

*Mojtaba Mollahossein,Gholamreza Vossoughi,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Transfer-learning pipeline using a lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM to predict knee angles from EMG across datasets, achieving strong generalization with few gait cycles; gains from including history angles and, on an exoskeleton, additional inputs (kinematics, interaction force) yield state-of-the-art NMAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate, real-time knee angle prediction from EMG with limited subject-specific data and good cross-dataset/device generalization for rehabilitation and assistive devices.

Method: Pre-train a lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM on the Georgia Tech EMG dataset; transfer/finetune to the UCI and SMLE datasets with four knee-related EMG channels. Evaluate EMG-only predictions (one-step and 50-step horizons); augment with historical knee angles; on SMLE, fuse EMG with kinematic and interaction force inputs to further improve accuracy.

Result: EMG-only NMAE: 6.8% (one-step) and 13.7% (50-step) for abnormal subjects. Adding historical knee angles reduces NMAE to 3.1% (one-step) and 3.5% (50-step) for normal subjects, and 2.8% (one-step) and 7.5% (50-step) for abnormal subjects. With SMLE multimodal inputs (EMG + kinematics + interaction force), NMAE improves to 1.09% (one-step) and 3.1% (50-step). Demonstrates robust generalization across short- and long-horizon predictions and rehab scenarios.

Conclusion: The transfer-learning framework achieves strong cross-dataset/device generalization for knee-angle prediction from EMG, with significant performance gains when incorporating history information and multimodal inputs, highlighting potential for real-time rehabilitation tools with limited new-subject data.

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-trained quadruped locomotion on an oscillating bridge yields more robust gait policies; zero-shot sim-to-real transfer demonstrated for navigating vibrating terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots struggle with vertical ground perturbations from oscillating surfaces; improving robustness on vibrating terrains is essential for real-world rough terrains and structures like bridges.

Method: Train 15 locomotion policies for a Unitree Go2 on MuJoCo using PPO. Gaits: trot, pace, bound, free, default. Training conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridges with distinct height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Bridge: 13.24 m, steel-concrete, 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency. Domain randomization to enable zero-shot transfer to the real bridge.

Result: Policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit greater stability and adaptability under dynamic perturbations than those trained on rigid surfaces. Zero-shot transfer to the real bridge is achieved, with robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.

Conclusion: Simulation-based RL with domain randomization effectively yields robust quadruped locomotion in vibrating environments and can inform design strategies for traversing vibrating terrains in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

*Wentao Guo,Yizhou Wang,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An underactuated adaptive robotic hand (Hockens-A) uses the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage, and a four-bar linkage to enable three adaptive grasp modes (parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, enveloping) with a single actuator. It leverages passive mechanical intelligence for compliance in unstructured environments, validated via kinematic optimization, simulations, and a 3D-printed prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable versatile, compliant grasping in unstructured environments with minimal actuation by exploiting passive mechanisms and carefully designed linkages.

Method: Integrate the Hoeckens mechanism with a double-parallelogram linkage and a four-bar amplification system; perform kinematic optimization of push angle and linkage lengths; analyze fingertip motion and mode transitions via simulations; analyze grasping force with power equations; fabricate a 3D-printed prototype and experimentally validate the three grasp modes under environmental constraints.

Result: The hand achieves three grasp modes—parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping—with smooth transitions and stable grasps demonstrated in simulations and experimental tests on a 3D-printed prototype, indicating broad applicability.

Conclusion: A single-actuator, underactuated hand utilizing passive components and carefully integrated linkages can realize versatile grasping across object geometries, suggesting generalizable design principles for compliant, adaptable grippers.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

*Wentao Guo,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A compact underactuated gripper (Hoecken-D Hand) combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring to achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke adaptation to irregular objects, enabling single-actuator drive and maintaining fingertip parallelism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a simple, low-cost, robust gripper capable of handling irregular/thin objects in unstructured environments without multiple actuators or complex control.

Method: Reconfigures Hoecken linkage by replacing one member with differential links; uses a double-parallelogram for fingertip parallelism; integrates a differential mechanism that allows one finger to wrap inward upon obstacle; prototypes with PLA 3D printing; analyzes kinematics and forces; tests with simulations and physical prototypes; each finger can be driven by a linear actuator.

Result: Achieves a linear pinching span of ~200 mm; reliable grasping in both pinch modes across diverse geometries; demonstrates stability and adaptability; compact, adaptable and cost-effective.

Conclusion: The Hoecken-D Hand offers a versatile, low-complexity gripper design suitable for manipulation in unstructured environments, balancing parallel pinching with obstacle-adaptive behavior without requiring additional actuators.

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in
unstructured environments.

### [120] [Development of an Intuitive GUI for Non-Expert Teleoperation of Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13594)
*Austin Barret,Meng Cheng Lau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Designing a scalable, non-expert-friendly GUI for teleoperation of humanoid robots on a FIRA obstacle course, using UI/HRI principles to enable intuitive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap where many humanoid-robot systems lack non-expert-centered interfaces, hindering broader usability, training, and safety in teleoperation.

Method: Apply established UI development practices and HRI concepts to create a new interface aimed at non-expert teleoperation, focusing on simplicity and scalability for FIRA obstacle-course tasks.

Result: No empirical results are reported; the work outlines a design framework and development plan for a non-expert teleoperation GUI.

Conclusion: If implemented and validated, the GUI could lower barriers for non-experts to operate humanoid robots and potentially improve performance in obstacle-course tasks; future work should include usability studies and performance evaluations.

Abstract: The operation of humanoid robotics is an essential field of research with
many practical and competitive applications. Many of these systems, however, do
not invest heavily in developing a non-expert-centered graphical user interface
(GUI) for operation. The focus of this research is to develop a scalable GUI
that is tailored to be simple and intuitive so non-expert operators can control
the robot through a FIRA-regulated obstacle course. Using common practices from
user interface development (UI) and understanding concepts described in
human-robot interaction (HRI) and other related concepts, we will develop a new
interface with the goal of a non-expert teleoperation system.

### [121] [Active Tactile Exploration for Rigid Body Pose and Shape Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13595)
*Ethan K. Gordon,Bruke Baraki,Hien Bui,Michael Posa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A tactile-only learning and exploration framework to infer the shape and pose of rigid objects (cuboids and convex polyhedra) with minimal data, using active information-gain-driven exploration to accelerate learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based object manipulation struggles with occlusions and unseen objects. Tactile sensing offers robustness but data is temporally sparse; there's a need for data-efficient, physically plausible models and exploration strategies that minimize robot motion during contact.

Method: Introduce a loss that enforces physical constraints without rigid-body contact stiffness, learned from tactile data only. The framework identifies geometry (cuboid/convex polyhedra) from first contact with less than tens of seconds of random data, and uses an exploration policy that maximizes Expected Information Gain to speed up learning.

Result: Achieves rapid learning from minimal tactile data (under 10 seconds after first contact) in both simulation and real-robot experiments, accurately recovering simple convex geometries and their location.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a data-efficient tactile-only approach to object shape and pose estimation with active exploration; promising for robust manipulation with limited data, though currently demonstrated on simple convex shapes and may require extension to more complex geometries and non-convex objects.

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

### [122] [PlanarMesh: Building Compact 3D Meshes from LiDAR using Incremental Adaptive Resolution Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13599)
*Jiahao Wang,Nived Chebrolu,Yifu Tao,Lintong Zhang,Ayoung Kim,Maurice Fallon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PlanarMesh introduces an incremental, adaptive, planar-mesh LiDAR reconstruction method that couples plane modeling with meshing to deliver accurate, compact, real-time surface maps using a BVH-accelerated, multi-threaded implementation; it achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods while producing dramatically smaller outputs and running near real-time (~2 Hz on a 64-beam LiDAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is online 3D LiDAR mapping that is both detailed and computationally efficient. Existing approaches (e.g., TSDF, occupancy grids, voxel meshes) trade off accuracy, memory, or real-time performance. A representation that adapts mesh resolution and leverages plane geometry can yield detailed surfaces with smaller data footprints.

Method: Introduce planar-mesh representation combining planar modeling and mesh-based reconstruction. Incrementally update using local surface curvature and free-space constraints from sensor data. Use a multi-threaded architecture with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for storage and fast queries. Adapt mesh resolution to balance detail and efficiency.

Result: Achieves reconstruction accuracy comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods (TSDF, occupancy mapping, voxel-based meshing) while producing output files about 10x smaller than raw LiDAR input and over 5x smaller than mesh-based methods. Real-time performance around 2 Hz for a 64-beam sensor.

Conclusion: PlanarMesh provides a scalable, efficient online LiDAR mapping framework that merges plane modeling with mesh reconstruction and BVH acceleration to deliver accurate, compact reconstructions in real time, suitable for robotics and mapping tasks.

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file
sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than
mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a
64-beam sensor).

### [123] [Efficient Force and Stiffness Prediction in Robotic Produce Handling with a Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13616)
*Preston Fairchild,Claudia Chen,Xiaobo Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A low-cost flexible pressure sensor integrated into both rigid and soft robotic grippers enables gentle, adaptive grasping of diverse produce, with a fast estimation method to infer steady-state force from transient data for real-time use; additionally provides estimates of size, stiffness, and ripeness for quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safely handling delicate produce to prevent bruising while enabling automated harvesting and processing; need force feedback across varying shapes, sizes, and mechanical properties.

Method: Develop a flexible pressure sensor; integrate with rigid gripper and pneumatically actuated soft finger; propose algorithm to accelerate estimation of steady-state sensor output from transient response; validate via grasping experiments with produce of unknown sizes and stiffnesses.

Result: Sensor successfully enables feedback for grasping diverse produce; can estimate size, stiffness, and ripeness; supports force feedback across variable stiffness; demonstrates potential for quality control and selective distribution based on ripeness.

Conclusion: The integrated sensor provides practical, low-cost tactile feedback to improve automatic produce handling and quality assessment, with applicability to future automatic identification and distribution based on ripeness and bruising.

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

### [124] [Characterizing Lidar Point-Cloud Adversities Using a Vector Field Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13619)
*Daniel Choate,Jason Rife*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An offline visualization method using a vector-field plot to reveal local discrepancies between registered LiDAR point clouds, guiding a human analyst to classify and remove adversity mechanisms; demonstrated on simulation and field data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist human analysts in diagnosing and classifying adversity modes that degrade LiDAR scan matching, capturing patterns not easily discernible in raw point clouds in offline analysis.

Method: Generate a vector-field representation of local misalignments between registered point clouds (offline). Apply to two proof-of-concept datasets (simulation and field experiment). A human analyst interprets the plots to identify adversity mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data to expose smaller discrepancies.

Result: The vector-field plots reveal patterns that are hard to discern from raw data, enabling an analyst to identify and remove adversity mechanisms, focusing on progressively smaller discrepancies in both proof-of-concept datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a viable offline visualization tool for classifying adversity modes in LiDAR scan matching and demonstrates potential to improve data quality by guiding human-in-the-loop refinement; applicable to simulation and field data.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

### [125] [A Modular Object Detection System for Humanoid Robots Using YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13625)
*Nicolas Pottier,Meng Cheng Lau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A YOLOv9-based general vision module for robotics (ROS1) trained on FIRA Hurocup data; evaluated against a geometric vision baseline; achieves comparable precision but at higher computational cost, with improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision is a major bottleneck in robotics; need robust, efficient perception in resource-constrained environments. The work aims to integrate a strong deep-learning detector (YOLOv9) into ROS1 via a virtual environment, and to assess trade-offs with existing geometric methods on a target robotics task (FIRA Hurocup).

Method: Train YOLOv9 on a dataset tailored to FIRA robotics Hurocup. Implement a ROS1 vision module using a virtual environment to enable YOLO compatibility. Evaluate performance with FPS and mAP, and compare against an existing geometric framework in static and dynamic contexts.

Result: The YOLO model achieved comparable precision to the geometric model but with higher computational cost, and provided improved robustness.

Conclusion: A generalized YOLOv9-based vision module can deliver robustness with similar accuracy to geometric approaches at the expense of higher compute. This indicates a trade-off between accuracy/robustness and efficiency, motivating further optimization for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Within the field of robotics, computer vision remains a significant barrier
to progress, with many tasks hindered by inefficient vision systems. This
research proposes a generalized vision module leveraging YOLOv9, a
state-of-the-art framework optimized for computationally constrained
environments like robots. The model is trained on a dataset tailored to the
FIRA robotics Hurocup. A new vision module is implemented in ROS1 using a
virtual environment to enable YOLO compatibility. Performance is evaluated
using metrics such as frames per second (FPS) and Mean Average Precision (mAP).
Performance is then compared to the existing geometric framework in static and
dynamic contexts. The YOLO model achieved comparable precision at a higher
computational cost then the geometric model, while providing improved
robustness.

*Senyu Fei,Siyin Wang,Junhao Shi,Zihao Dai,Jikun Cai,Pengfang Qian,Li Ji,Xinzhe He,Shiduo Zhang,Zhaoye Fei,Jinlan Fu,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Top Visual-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation are highly brittle: modest perturbations in viewpoints or initial robot states cause performance to collapse (from ~95% to <30%), while language inputs have little effect as models often ignore them, calling benchmark scores into question.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether high benchmark performance of VLA models reflects true competence or hidden brittleness, and to quantify robustness under realistic environmental and task perturbations.

Method: Systematically perturb seven factors (objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, lighting, background textures, sensor noise) and evaluate multiple state-of-the-art VLA models to measure performance degradation and sensitivity, with additional tests on sensitivity to language variations.

Result: Models exhibit extreme brittleness: sensitivity to camera viewpoints and robot initial states; performance drops from ~95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations and tend to ignore language instructions.

Conclusion: High benchmark scores do not guarantee true competence. Evaluation methods must assess reliability under realistic variation; there is a need for robustness-focused benchmarks and training incentives to ensure models attend to and correctly execute language instructions in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

TL;DR: A vision-based autonomous drone racing system is evaluated in both controlled (with external tracking) and uninstrumented environments, achieving parity with professional pilots, with public release of flight data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between lab performance and real-world applicability of autonomous drone systems; current methods rely on controlled settings; need robust perception-based autonomy for unstructured environments.

Method: Vision-based autonomy approach; experiments in controlled environment with ground-truth via external tracking; field tests in challenging uninstrumented environment without ground-truth; comparison to a world-class human pilot; data release of flights.

Result: Matches professional pilots in both scenarios; demonstrates competitive performance; public data release.

Conclusion: Vision-based autonomy is viable for real-world drone racing and potentially broader fields; emphasizes transparency and benchmarking through data release; further work to expand to varied contexts.

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

TL;DR: A scalable macroscale fabrication framework using voxelized lattices, hierarchical blocking, mobile robots, and a live digital twin to plan and coordinate assembly, validated on meter-scale objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Desktop-scale fabrication is mature, but large-scale structures remain complex, expensive, and unreliable. The work seeks a simpler, scalable, and cost-effective pathway to meter-scale construction using modular lattice blocks and mobile robots.

Method: Voxelize the target structure and populate it with an architected lattice. Group voxels into larger interconnected blocks produced by standard digital fabrication. Use mobile robots to traverse the structure and place blocks to reach meter-scale assemblies. Introduce a live digital twin for global planning and live user interaction. Develop a modular assembly robot for hierarchical voxel handling. Validate via voxelization, hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of meter-scale objects.

Result: Demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline: voxelization, hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic assembly enabling the construction of meter-scale objects, supported by a live digital twin for control and coordination.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable macroscale fabrication with simpler components and programmable coordination, leveraging modular blocks, digital fabrication of blocks, and robot-assisted assembly guided by a live digital twin; potential improvements focus on throughput, robustness, and autonomy for larger or more complex structures.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
meter-scale objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A spatial grounding guided training framework (InternVLA-M1) unifies spatial reasoning with action for scalable robot instruction following, achieving improvements across multiple benchmarks and simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, general-purpose robots that can translate natural language instructions into embodied actions with reliable spatial grounding, bridging the gap between where to act and how to act.

Method: Two-stage approach: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on 2.3M data to determine where to act by aligning instructions with visual/embodiment-agnostic positions; (ii) spatially guided action post-training to generate embodiment-aware actions via plug-and-play spatial prompts. Additionally, a simulation engine collected 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes to enable synthetic co-training; evaluation includes 200 tasks and 3K+ objects; real-world clustering tests; long-horizon reasoning scenarios; and open-source code/modeled intended.

Result: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its non-spatial variant by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka; shows stronger spatial reasoning in box, point, and trace prediction. In simulation, 244K episodes yield a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. Real-world clustered pick-and-place improves by 7.3%, and synthetic co-training yields +20.6% on unseen objects and configurations. In long-horizon reasoning scenarios, it surpasses existing works by over 10%.

Conclusion: Spatially guided training serves as a unifying, scalable principle for resilient generalist robots, enabling improved instruction following across diverse settings. The authors provide open-source code and models.

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

*Junqing Huang,Haihui Wang,Michael Ruzhansky*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Variational semi-sparsity framework for denoising 3D meshes via higher-order operators, solved with multi-block ADMM, preserving sharp features while smoothing, validated on synthetic and real data with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising irregular triangulated meshes while preserving sharp features is challenging due to nonuniform sampling; need higher-order differential operators and regularization that promote piecewise-smooth surfaces.

Method: Introduce discrete higher-order differential operators on triangle meshes; formulate semi-sparsity regularized minimization for mesh denoising; solve via multi-block ADMM.

Result: Achieves high-quality simultaneous fitting; preserves sharp features; yields piecewise-polynomial smoothing; shows competitive/superior results vs. state-of-the-art on synthetic and real scans, both visually and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively denoises triangulated meshes with robust feature preservation and smoothing, offering a practical and superior alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new variational framework for 3D surface
denoising over triangulated meshes, which is inspired by the success of
semi-sparse regularization in image processing. Differing from the uniformly
sampled image data, mesh surfaces are typically represented by irregular,
non-uniform structures, which thus complicate the direct application of the
standard formulation and pose challenges in both model design and numerical
implementation. To bridge this gap, we first introduce the discrete
approximations of higher-order differential operators over triangle meshes and
then develop a semi-sparsity regularized minimization model for mesh denoising.
This new model is efficiently solved by using a multi-block alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and achieves high-quality simultaneous
fitting performance -- preserving sharp features while promoting
piecewise-polynomial smoothing surfaces. To verify its effectiveness, we also
present a series of experimental results on both synthetic and real scanning
data, showcasing the competitive and superior results compared to
state-of-the-art methods, both visually and quantitatively.

### [131] [Local Timescale Gates for Timescale-Robust Continual Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12843)
*Ansh Tiwari,Ayush Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-Gate enables dual-timescale neuron dynamics with a local gate and a variance-based homeostatic regularization to improve continual learning in spiking neural networks; shows hardware-friendly improvements on a temporal benchmark, compatible with Loihi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stability-plasticity dilemma in spiking neural networks for continual learning, enabling fast adaptation while preserving slow contextual information without relying on external replay or expensive orthogonalization.

Method: Each spiking neuron maintains parallel fast and slow activity traces (two time constants). A learned local gate modulates their influence to balance plasticity and stability. A variance-tracking regularizer stabilizes firing activity. The approach is designed for neuromorphic hardware and leverages multiple synaptic traces with different decays (as on Intel's Loihi).

Result: On a challenging temporal classification benchmark, final accuracy reaches about 51 percent with LT-Gate, outperforming a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline (~46 percent) and older SNN methods.

Conclusion: Multi-timescale gating with local adaptation and homeostatic regularization substantially improves continual learning in SNNs and narrows the gap to conventional deep networks, while remaining hardware-friendly and suitable for on-chip learning.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

*Liangwei Nathan Zheng,Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pseudo-Alignment in LLM-based time-series models results from an interaction between the cone effect in pretrained LLMs and the low-dimensional nature of time-series data; a new method TimeSUP expands the time-series manifold to better fit language embeddings, improving long-horizon forecasting and enabling integration across pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why pseudo-alignment occurs in LLM4TS models and identify a practical mitigation that improves forecasting performance.

Method: Analyze the root causes by linking pseudo-alignment to the cone effect in pretrained LLM components and the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold of time-series data; propose TimeSUP to expand the time-series manifold to align with language embedding dimensions; evaluate across four LLM4TS pipelines and multiple long-term forecasting benchmarks.

Result: TimeSUP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and lightweight baselines on long-term forecasting; it preserves distinct time and language token features while enabling high cosine similarity in a unified embedding space; it is compatible with four existing LLM4TS pipelines and yields significant forecasting gains.

Conclusion: Pseudo-alignment stems from the cone effect interacting with low-dimensional time-series manifolds; TimeSUP mitigates this by enlarging the time-series manifold to better match language embeddings, yielding improved forecasting and easy integration across pipelines.

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

### [133] [FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927)
*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated class incremental learning framework (FedGTEA) that uses Gaussian task embeddings and 2-Wasserstein-based alignment to capture task knowledge, control forgetting, and preserve privacy with fixed-size representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scalability, heterogeneity, and privacy challenges in federated class incremental learning by using fixed-size probabilistic task representations and a probabilistic alignment objective.

Method: Client: Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) outputs Gaussian task embeddings of fixed size; captures task knowledge, uncertainty, and data heterogeneity. Server: uses 2-Wasserstein distance between Gaussian embeddings to measure inter-task gaps and applies a Wasserstein loss to enforce separation; avoids transmitting latent embeddings to preserve privacy.

Result: Empirical results on standard benchmarks show superior classification performance and significantly reduced forgetting, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: FedGTEA provides a scalable, privacy-conscious framework for federated class incremental learning with improved task separation and reduced forgetting; potential future work includes tighter privacy guarantees and further efficiency gains.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

### [134] [Learning at the Speed of Physics: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12934)
*Alex Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines enables competitive supervised learning with high accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, robust to hardware imperfections, suggesting EBMs can be realized on physical energy-descent hardware for fast, energy-efficient neuromorphic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical energy-descent systems offer a direct route to accelerate machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) map energy-based models to GHz dynamics and, with intrinsic noise, resemble Langevin sampling. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies optimization and learning on a single energy landscape with local rules, enabling training without backpropagation.

Method: Apply Equilibrium Propagation to OIMs and evaluate their learning performance on standard image classification benchmarks (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST). Assess robustness to hardware constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. Report accuracy and discuss implications for neuromorphic hardware.

Result: MNIST accuracy ~97.2 ± 0.1%; Fashion-MNIST accuracy ~88.0 ± 0.1%. Performance remains robust under realistic hardware constraints like quantization and phase noise.

Conclusion: OIMs trained with EP offer a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning, with EBMs potentially realizable on physical hardware whose dynamics perform the optimization.

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

### [135] [Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939)
*James Pedley,Benjamin Etheridge,Stephen J. Roberts,Francesco Quinzan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pruning improves robustness and can even enhance clean performance in adversarial RL; theoretical framework shows pruning tightens robustness bounds for SA-MDPs; three-term regret decomposition reveals a performance-robustness frontier; empirical results identify moderate sparsity sweet spots where robustness increases with little to no cost to performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning policies deployed in the real world face adversarial perturbations and over-parameterization; there is limited understanding of how pruning affects robustness in adversarial RL. This work develops a theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in SA-MDPs and provides empirical guidance.

Method: Develop theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in SA-MDPs; analyze Gaussian and categorical policies with Lipschitz networks; prove that element-wise pruning tightens robustness bounds; derive a three-term regret decomposition; empirically evaluate magnitude and micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with policy-aware adversaries.

Result: Element-wise pruning cannot reduce robustness bounds; pruning yields robustness gains; decomposition exposes robustness-robust frontier; empirical results show reproducible sweet spots at moderate sparsity where robustness improves substantially and clean performance is preserved or improved.

Conclusion: Pruning serves as a structural intervention for robust RL beyond compression, enabling controlled trade-offs between task performance and robustness, with practical guidelines for leveraging pruning to achieve robust policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

*Sana Tonekaboni,Lena Stempfle,Adibvafa Fallahpour,Walter Gerych,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes black-box privacy tests to measure memorization risks in EHR foundation models, auditing embedding and generative levels, distinguishing memorization from generalization, validated on a public EHR model, with an open-source privacy-assessment toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models trained on large-scale EHRs risk memorizing patient data, posing privacy threats. There is a need for practical, black-box methods to evaluate memorization, protect vulnerable subgroups, and enable reproducible privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Method: A suite of black-box evaluation tests probing memorization at embedding and generative levels, designed to separate generalization from harmful memorization. Framework contextualizes privacy risk in clinical settings and subgroups, and is validated on a publicly available EHR foundation model. An open-source toolkit is released to enable reproducible privacy assessments.

Result: Demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed tests on a public EHR foundation model and released an open-source toolkit to facilitate privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, reproducible approach to assess and mitigate privacy risks from memorization in EHR foundation models, aiding safer deployment and protecting patient privacy.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

### [137] [A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in Deep Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12957)
*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal XAI framework for bias detection and mitigation using attention-based fusion, Grad-CAM++ explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop; shows improved accuracy, F1, and explanation fidelity on multimodal MNIST variants, with ablations highlighting benefits of interpretability for robustness and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks like MNIST often hide latent biases and complex multimodal interactions, reducing trust in deep models for high-stakes tasks. A combined emphasis on performance, transparency, and fairness is needed.

Method: Proposes an integrated framework combining (1) attention-augmented feature fusion for multimodal inputs, (2) Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and (3) a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop to detect and mitigate biases. Evaluated on multimodal MNIST extensions with metrics including accuracy, F1, and IoU-based explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI).

Result: On multimodal MNIST, achieved 93.2% accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1% IoU-XAI explanation fidelity, outperforming unimodal and non-explainable baselines. Ablation studies show that coupling interpretability with bias-aware learning improves robustness and alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: Integrating interpretability with bias-aware learning can enhance trustworthiness, offering a practical path toward performance, transparency, and fairness in sensitive AI domains.

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

### [138] [Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967)
*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CI-EX offers an outlier-informed, iterative RI method that labels rejected loans close to the accepted distribution, improving RI metrics (Kickout, Area under Kickout) with competitive AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reject inference suffers from sample bias due to distributional differences between accepted and rejected applicants; blind extrapolation from accepted to rejected can mislead risk models.

Method: Iteratively identify the rejected-sample distribution with an outlier detector and label rejected individuals closest to the accepted distribution using probabilities from a supervised classifier; repeat to refine labels.

Result: Evaluated on two large real-world credit datasets: CI-EX improves RI-specific metrics and maintains competitive AUC, outperforming existing RI models in RI metrics.

Conclusion: CI-EX mitigates extrapolation bias in reject inference, delivering better RI metrics without substantially sacrificing predictive performance; demonstrates promise for credit risk and other domains with biased samples.

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

### [139] [A Connection Between Score Matching and Local Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12975)
*Eric Yeats,Aaron Jacobson,Darryl Hannan,Yiran Jia,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Denoising score matching loss can serve as a scalable estimator of local intrinsic dimension (LID), since LID is a lower bound of this loss; the implicit score matching loss similarly approximates LID and relates to FLIPD. Experiments on a manifold benchmark and Stable Diffusion 3.5 show DSML-based LID estimation is accurate and memory-efficient as problem size and quantization grow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying LID in high-dimensional data is challenging. Diffusion-model-based insights reveal LID, but existing estimators require many forward passes or gradient computations, making them impractical in compute/memory-constrained environments. A scalable, memory-efficient estimator is highly desirable.

Method: Prove that LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss and propose using this loss as an LID estimator. Show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss approximates LID via the normal dimension and connects to FLIPD. Validate the approach on a manifold benchmark and with Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Result: The denoising score matching loss emerges as a highly competitive and scalable LID estimator, delivering superior accuracy and reduced memory footprint as problem size and quantization increase.

Conclusion: Denoising score matching loss provides an effective, scalable tool for estimating LID in high-dimensional data, enabling practical LID estimation in resource-constrained settings and linking to related estimators like FLIPD.

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

### [140] [Reference-Specific Unlearning Metrics Can Hide the Truth: A Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12981)
*Sungjun Cho,Dasol Hwang,Frederic Sala,Sangheum Hwang,Kyunghyun Cho,Sungmin Cha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FADE is a distributional alignment metric for unlearning that compares bidirectional likelihoods between an unlearned model and a reference model across generated samples, addressing blind spots in reference-based evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning metrics rely on reference outputs or classifiers, which may not guarantee true unlearning. Models can retain unwanted knowledge that is retrievable via alternative prompts or attacks, making existing metrics misleading.

Method: FADE computes distributional similarity by evaluating bidirectional likelihood assignments over generated samples between the unlearned model and a reference (gold) model, capturing alignment across the entire output distribution without relying on fixed references.

Result: In TOFU (LLM unlearning) and UnlearnCanvas (text-to-image diffusion unlearning), methods that score near-optimal on traditional metrics often fail to achieve distributional equivalence; some become farther from the gold standard after unlearning, revealing gaps in current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: FADE offers a principled, robust evaluation framework for genuine unlearning by measuring distributional equivalence, guiding the development of truly effective unlearning methods beyond reference-based metrics.

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

### [141] [Max It or Miss It: Benchmarking LLM On Solving Extremal Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12997)
*Binxin Gao,Jingjun Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExtremBench introduces a dataset of 93 standardized extrema-finding problems derived from inequality exercises used in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad, revealing that LLMs' extremal solving does not consistently track with general mathematical reasoning benchmarks like AIME-25 and MATH-500, and highlighting gaps in current evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the sources and limits of LLMs' reasoning, particularly for optimization under constraints, is critical as test-time scaling and chain-of-thought capabilities improve. Extremal optimization underpins planning, control, and resource allocation, yet mainstream benchmarks may not adequately probe this capability.

Method: Transform inequality exercises into 93 standardized extrema-finding problems, creating ExtremBench. Evaluate multiple open-source model families (e.g., Qwen3, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek) on ExtremBench and compare performance to standard math benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500 to assess alignment between extremal-solving and general mathematical reasoning.

Result: Findings show that extremal-solving abilities in LLMs do not consistently align with broader mathematical benchmarks. Some models exhibit strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, while others excel at extremal tasks despite weaker general reasoning. This mismatch indicates that existing benchmarks may not fully capture the spectrum of mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Current evaluation practices overlook the specific skill of extremal optimization. ExtremBench provides a targeted benchmark to probe this capability, revealing gaps that call for more comprehensive and diverse evaluation suites to better understand and improve LLM reasoning in constrained optimization contexts.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid DL architecture CSI-4CAST with a large-scale CSI-RRG benchmark for robust and efficient CSI prediction in mMIMO; achieves high accuracy with lower FLOPs; strong generalization across TDD/FDD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robustness to non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and computational efficiency in DL-based CSI prediction, and to establish a standardized benchmark for evaluation.

Method: A four-component hybrid DL design incorporating CNN residuals, adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers; training and evaluation on a large-scale CSI-RRG benchmark with >300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic TDD/FDD scenarios, covering multiple channel models, delay spreads, user velocities, and noise types; public release of dataset and protocols.

Result: CSI-4CAST achieves superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost, outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenarios; it provides the best performance among evaluated models and reduces FLOPs by 5x and 3x compared to LLM4CP (strongest baseline). The CSI-RRG benchmark also yields insights into how channel factors affect performance and generalization.

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST and CSI-RRG establish a robust, efficient, and generalizable framework for CSI prediction in mMIMO and offer a standardized platform to benchmark and spur further research on robust CSI forecasting across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

TL;DR: Introduces two SGD-based optimizers, IAGD and NRSGD, to accelerate training and regularize gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow convergence and overfitting in SGD by leveraging second-order information (Newton interpolation) and controlled noise regularization.

Method: Proposes Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) using Newton interpolation to exploit gradient relations across iterations; introduces Noise-Regularized SGD (NRSGD) that adds controlled noise to gradients as a regularizer; evaluates on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using CNNs in Keras, comparing against classical optimizers.

Result: Empirical experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show that IAGD and NRSGD are viable improvements to SGD, with potential performance gains over traditional optimizers.

Conclusion: IAGD and NRSGD appear to be promising SGD enhancements for CNN training; further validation, ablation studies, and hyperparameter tuning are warranted to establish consistent benefits.

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

### [144] [AMORE: Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network for Stiff Chemical Kinetics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12999)
*Kamaljyoti Nath,Additi Pandey,Bryan T. Susi,Hessam Babaee,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMORE is an adaptive multi-output neural operator framework (DeepONet/FNO) for stiff thermochemical kinetics that predicts all species/thermochemical states from initial conditions, enforces mass-fraction unity exactly, and uses adaptive losses and a Unity-satisfying trunk; demonstrated on syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states), with two-step training, aiming to accelerate CFD simulations in combustion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time integration of stiff reactive systems is computationally expensive due to widely separated time scales, making explicit schemes costly and implicit schemes heavy. Neural operators offer a surrogate alternative but require reliable learning across multiple outputs with proper error handling and physical constraints (e.g., mass conservation).

Method: AMORE introduces an operator that outputs multiple thermochemical states from initial conditions; employs two adaptive loss functions that account for per-state and per-sample errors; designs the trunk to satisfy Partition of Unity; enforces unity mass-fraction constraint via an invertible map turning the n-dimensional mass-fraction vector into an (n-1)-dimensional space for training; uses a two-step training scheme for DeepONet with multiple outputs and extends adaptive losses to trunk and branch training; demonstrates with DeepONet and also with FNO.

Result: Empirical validation on syngas with 12 states and GRI-Mech 3.0 with 24 active species (out of 54) shows the framework can learn multiple outputs reliably and enforce mass conservation exactly, suggesting AMORE as a viable backbone to accelerate turbulent combustion simulations in CFD.

Conclusion: AMORE provides a general, adaptable framework for reliable multi-output operator learning in stiff chemical kinetics, with built-in physical constraints and adaptive loss design; applicable to DeepONet and FNO, and positioned as a foundation for faster CFD studies in combustion and related reactive transport systems.

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

### [145] [Escaping Local Optima in the Waddington Landscape: A Multi-Stage TRPO-PPO Approach for Single-Cell Perturbation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13018)
*Francis Boabang,Samuel Asante Gyamerah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage, data-driven reinforcement learning framework to model single-cell perturbations that uses a curvature-aware, natural gradient initialization via Fisher-vector products and KL-constrained optimization, followed by proximal policy optimization, yielding improved generalization and more plausible cell-lineage predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven perturbation models (e.g., VAEs, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and transformer-based models) often get trapped in local optima within the nonconvex Waddington landscape, producing implausible or spurious differentiation outcomes. Fully data-driven approaches lack robust initialization to escape these optima and converge to correct lineages.

Method: First, compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a curvature-aware initialization. Then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates on minibatches to refine the policy.

Result: The proposed initialization substantially improves generalization on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) perturbation analyses.

Conclusion: A fully data-driven RL framework with a principled, curvature-aware initialization can help escape local optima in cell-fate trajectories and deliver better perturbation predictions, with the two-stage RL approach effectively initializing and refining the policy for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

### [146] [Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study of learning from streaming data via time-varying optimization with a weight-based objective. Uniform weights yield tracking error (TE) that decays as O(1/t); discounted weights create a nonzero error floor depending on the discount factor and gradient updates. The paper provides tight TE bounds and corroborates them with simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision-making in dynamic environments by explicitly modeling the streaming-data origin of time-varying objectives, and to understand how different weighting of past data affects the ability of gradient descent to track the time-varying optimum.

Method: Introduce a structured weight-based formulation where the objective at each time is a weighted average of past losses. Analyze two weighting schemes: (i) uniform weights and (ii) discounted (geometrically decaying) weights. Derive tight bounds on tracking error (TE) under gradient descent updates, showing distinct asymptotic behaviors. Validate results with numerical simulations.

Result: Analytically, TE vanishes asymptotically as O(1/t) under uniform weighting; with discounted weighting, TE has a nonzero floor determined by the discount factor and the number of gradient updates per time step. The bounds are tight and supported by simulations.

Conclusion: Weight choice critically affects tracking performance in streaming-data time-varying optimization: uniform weighting ensures vanishing TE, while discounted weighting yields a persistent error floor; the work provides precise TE bounds and guidance for selecting weighting schemes in dynamic learning settings.

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

*Joshua R. Tempelman,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end ML workflow for automated ultrasonic weld inspection in realistic industrial settings, using a reduced-order Helmholtz/Lamb wave model to generate data, transfer learning from 3D elastodynamic simulations, and diffusion-guided domain alignment with U-Net-based segmentation/inversion to handle noisy, out-of-distribution LDV measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDE weld inspections face data scarcity and environmental noise; there is a need for a robust, end-to-end ML pipeline that can operate on real industrial data.

Method: Use a reduced-order Helmholtz model (based on Lamb wave theory) to generate a comprehensive training dataset across weld heterogeneity and crack defects; refine with transfer learning using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations; apply guided diffusion to map out-of-distribution LDV scans into in-distribution representations; process with a U-Net for segmentation and inversion.

Result: The framework is proposed as an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data, integrating data generation, domain alignment, and inversion under noisy industrial conditions.

Conclusion: An integrated workflow combining reduced-order modeling, diffusion-based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation/inversion can address data curation and signal corruption challenges, enabling automated weld inspection in realistic settings.

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

### [148] [Information Shapes Koopman Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025)
*Xiaoyuan Cheng,Wenxuan Yuan,Yiming Yang,Yuanzhao Zhang,Sibo Cheng,Yi He,Zhuo Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An information-theoretic framework for Koopman learning that balances simplicity and expressiveness via latent mutual information and von Neumann entropy, yielding stable, interpretable finite-dimensional representations with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman modeling is powerful but requires finite subspaces; deep architectures struggle due to suboptimal representations. This is linked to the information bottleneck, which trades compression against predictive power. A principled balance is needed to avoid collapse while preserving mode diversity.

Method: Introduce an information-theoretic Lagrangian that explicitly balances latent mutual information (simplicity) and von Neumann entropy (expressiveness). Propose an optimization algorithm based on this Lagrangian, analyze and visualize learned manifolds, and validate on diverse dynamical systems. Code is released.

Result: Empirically improves performance over existing Koopman learning methods, yielding stable and interpretable finite-dimensional Koopman representations. The latent space avoids collapse and maintains mode diversity, with learned manifolds aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: An information-theoretic Lagrangian provides a principled, generalizable approach to learning finite Koopman subspaces, balancing simplicity and expressiveness for stability and interpretability across dynamical systems; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

*Pouria Behnoudfar,Charlotte Moser,Marc Bocquet,Sibo Cheng,Nan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explainable AI framework that fuses coarse idealized models with high-res Earth system models via a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique to improve CMIP6 El Niño simulations with interpretable corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution Earth system models exhibit persistent biases, especially for extreme events and distributions. Idealized models capture fundamental processes and can be calibrated precisely; bridging model hierarchies can leverage complementary strengths.

Method: Develop a bridging model with a reconfigured latent data assimilation that exploits sparse outputs from idealized models, yielding a high-resolution, globally accurate emulator. The AI component is designed to be interpretable, enabling physics-based understanding and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Significant bias corrections in CMIP6 simulations of El Niño spatiotemporal patterns using information from idealized models, demonstrating improved global accuracy and effective physics-assisted digital twins.

Conclusion: Pushing idealized model development and cross-community communication is crucial; the framework provides an efficient, interpretable route to combining models of varying complexity for better Earth system emulation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

*Konstantinos Barmpas,Na Lee,Alexandros Koliousis,Yannis Panagakis,Dimitrios A. Adamos,Nikolaos Laskaris,Stefanos Zafeiriou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroRVQ introduces a codebook-based EEG tokenizer that preserves high-frequency dynamics via multi-scale features, hierarchical RVQ codebooks, and phase-aware loss, enabling efficient compression and superior reconstruction; it outperforms prior large brainwave models and supports broader brainwave modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural tokenizers for EEG foundation models struggle to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting reconstruction fidelity and downstream performance; a scalable tokenizer with high fidelity is needed for robust brainwave representations and multimodal integration.

Method: Develop NeuroRVQ with (i) multi-scale feature extractors covering the full neural frequency spectrum, (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding, and (iii) a phase- and amplitude-aware loss function; evaluate on reconstruction and downstream tasks within a large brainwave model framework.

Result: Achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing large brainwave models across downstream tasks; demonstrates efficient EEG compression and accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, enabling robust generative masked modeling.

Conclusion: Codebook-based tokenizers provide a strong prior for general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling, and multimodal biosignal integration.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

*Nikita Kachaev,Daniil Zelezetsky,Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovelev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can be strong baselines for online model-free RL in continuous control, provided careful design of inputs, shared actor-critic components, and sequential data handling; empirical results show stability and competitiveness across fully/partially observable and vector/image settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexploration of transformers in online model-free RL due to sensitivity to training setups and architecture, and to identify practical design choices that yield competitive performance.

Method: Systematically study key design questions: input conditioning, sharing components between actor and critic, and how to slice and present sequential data during training. Conduct extensive experiments across fully and partially observable tasks and both vector- and image-based observations to derive stable architectural and training strategies.

Result: Identified stable architectural and training strategies that enable transformers to achieve competitive performance across a range of online model-free RL tasks, including both vector- and image-based settings and fully/partially observable scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for applying transformers in online RL and support broader adoption by clarifying design choices that matter for performance and stability.

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

*Yubo Zhang,Xiao-Yang Liu,Xiaodong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised DL-based downlink beamforming for large-scale MU-MISO using a Transformer-based learning-to-optimize framework, with curriculum learning, semi-amortized updates, and sliding-window training; achieves near-WMMSE performance with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time, scalable downlink beamforming in large MU-MISO systems while reducing computational complexity compared with iterative optimization, by learning offline and deploying lightweight inference.

Method: An unsupervised, offline-trained, multi-layer Transformer with residual connections refines channel and beamformer features under a learning-to-optimize paradigm. Training is enhanced via curriculum learning (to improve early convergence and avoid local optima), semi-amortized updates (a few gradient ascent steps per Transformer block), and sliding-window training (train only a subset of blocks at a time).

Result: The approach outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely matches WMMSE at high SNRs, while offering substantially faster inference than both iterative methods and online learning approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Transformer-based L2O framework is effective for downlink beamforming in large-scale MU-MISO, delivering strong performance with real-time inference and scalable training strategies that stabilize optimization.

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Operational global ML nowcasting (Global MetNet) delivering 12h, ~5km, 15-min precipitation forecasts; outperforms hourly forecasts, especially in data-sparse regions, with real-time latency and wide deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional NWP (high latency, coarse resolution, global gaps) and extremely sparse radar coverage in the Global South; provide timely, high-resolution precipitation nowcasting to reduce forecast disparities.

Method: A global ML model using CORRA precipitation data, geostationary satellite data, and global NWP inputs to forecast 12 hours ahead at ~0.05 deg (~5 km) resolution with 15-minute steps; validated against ground radar and satellite data; deployed to millions via Google Search.

Result: Significantly outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts; higher skill (critical success index, fractions skill score) across all rates and lead times; performs better in data-sparse regions than the best high-resolution NWP in the US; forecasts generated in under a minute; deployed for millions of users.

Conclusion: A key step toward reducing global forecast disparities by integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations into weather forecasting and enabling real-time, wide-coverage nowcasting.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masked diffusion models for text can reason in parallel and are theoretically equivalent to polynomially-padded PLTs in finite-precision log-width; they can simulate CoT-augmented transformers and are faster on some problems (e.g., regular languages).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize what reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and their efficiency, by linking them to CoT and PLTs.

Method: Theoretical analysis in finite-precision log-width; establish equivalence between MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs; show capability to solve CoT-augmented transformer problems; identify problem classes where MDMs offer parallel-speed advantages.

Result: MDMs are equivalent to polynomially-padded PLTs; they can solve all problems solvable by CoT-augmented transformers; for certain classes (including regular languages) MDMs achieve substantially faster reasoning due to parallel generation.

Conclusion: MDMs offer a provably powerful and potentially more efficient alternative for reasoning tasks, bridging diffusion-based and transformer-based reasoning frameworks; results delineate when to prefer parallel, non-autoregressive approaches.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

*Anupam Nayak,Tong Yang,Osman Yagan,Gauri Joshi,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL-regularized learning in two-player and Markov games enables sample-efficient algorithms whose regret scales as O(log T / beta) plus the usual O~(sqrt(T)) term, via OMG and SOMG using best-response sampling and optimistic bonuses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the theoretical benefits of KL regularization with a fixed reference policy in game-theoretic RL, motivated by preserving reference traits and leveraging prior knowledge (e.g., pretrained models) and improving sample efficiency.

Method: Introduce OMG for matrix games and SOMG for Markov games, both using best-response sampling and optimistic bonuses; derive regret bounds showing log(T)/beta scaling in addition to the standard O~(sqrt(T)) regret; handle regularized and unregularized settings.

Result: Achieve logarithmic regret in T that scales inversely with beta, along with the standard O~(sqrt(T)) regret independent of beta, in both regularized and unregularized settings.

Conclusion: KL regularization with a fixed reference policy can improve sample efficiency in game-theoretic RL; the proposed algorithms provide formal regret guarantees and leverage prior knowledge or pretrained models as reference policies; future work may explore broader environments or tighter bounds.

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplicial embeddings provide a geometric inductive bias that yields sparse, discrete features, improving sample efficiency and final performance of actor-critic RL methods (FastTD3, FastSAC, PPO) without increasing runtime, across both continuous and discrete tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale environment parallelization in RL can still require many interactions to reach target performance; structured representations can improve generalization and sample efficiency.

Method: Introduce simplicial embeddings—lightweight layers constraining embeddings to simplicial structures to create sparse, discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. Apply this representation to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO across varied environments.

Result: Consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and final performance across continuous and discrete control tasks, with no deterioration in runtime speed.

Conclusion: Simplicial embeddings serve as a beneficial geometric inductive bias for RL representations, enhancing learning efficiency and final performance for multiple actor-critic algorithms without added computational cost.

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

*Haolin Pan,Jinyuan Dong,Hongbin Zhang,Hongyu Lin,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a quasi-dynamic program representation by probing IR with diverse optimization sequences to build a Program Behavior Spectrum, discretized via Product Quantization and learned with a multi-task PQ-BERT, improving static baselines on Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static program representations are efficient but miss behavioral insights under transformations, while dynamic representations convey performance but are costly and nondeterministic. The paper aims to bridge this gap with a scalable, low-overhead quasi-dynamic approach that captures optimization sensitivity.

Method: 1) Define Program Behavior Spectrum by applying diverse optimization sequences to the program's IR and measuring how static features change. 2) Encode the high-dimensional spectrum using Product Quantization to obtain discrete compositional sub-words. 3) Pre-train a multi-task Transformer (PQ-BERT) to learn the grammar of these behavioral codes for downstream tasks (Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction). 4) Evaluate against static baselines on two compiler optimization tasks.

Result: PQ-BERT with the Program Behavior Spectrum outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines on both tasks. The authors provide public code at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Conclusion: A quasi-dynamic, compositional representation via the Program Behavior Spectrum and PQ-BERT offers improved predictive performance for compiler optimization tasks, suggesting a viable path beyond purely static or dynamic representations and enabling scalable, robust compiler analyses.

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

TL;DR: Proposes absolute cluster validity indices for compactness and separability, using per-cluster compactness and neighbor-based margins to identify the true number of clusters; evaluated on synthetic and real data and compared with standard indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cluster validity indices are relative and data-structure dependent, which makes reliably determining the true number of clusters across different datasets and algorithms difficult.

Method: Introduce a compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for cluster pairs. Use these to compute per-cluster compactness, the overall compactness distribution, and a margin between clusters. Use the absolute measures to infer the true number of clusters and validate via experiments.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the performance of the proposed absolute indices and their comparisons with widely-used cluster validity indices.

Conclusion: Absolute compactness and separability indices provide a robust means to assess clustering structure and can help identify the true number of clusters, showing favorable performance relative to traditional indices.

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge-guided weak supervision model CleverCatch for fraudulent prescription detection that embeds expert rules in a neural embedding space; achieves better AUC/Recall and interpretability than baselines on large real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome label scarcity and evolving fraud patterns in healthcare, while maintaining interpretability; combine domain expertise with data-driven learning to detect complex anomalies.

Method: Hybrid architecture where encoders are trained jointly on synthetic data representing compliant and violative behavior; learns soft rule embeddings that align with data samples in a shared embedding space; integrates structured domain knowledge as weak supervision to guide learning.

Result: Outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, with average improvements of 1.3 percentage points in AUC and 3.4 percentage points in recall on a large real-world dataset; ablation confirms usefulness of expert rules and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: Embedding expert rules into the learning process enhances accuracy and transparency, yielding a practical, adaptable framework for healthcare fraud detection that bridges heuristics and machine learning.

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

### [160] [DeepCausalMMM: A Deep Learning Framework for Marketing Mix Modeling with Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13087)
*Aditya Puttaparthi Tirumala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven, deep-learning–based MMM framework (DeepCausalMMM) that jointly learns temporal dynamics (adstock/lag) and causal structure (DAG) while modeling diminishing returns via Hill saturation, with multi-region support and extensive visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome traditional MMM limitations—linear/nonlinear, independent channels, and simplistic carryover—by learning hyperparameters from data, capturing temporal patterns and causal relationships, and supporting scalable, region-aware budget optimization.

Method: GRU-based temporal modeling to learn adstock and lag effects; DAG learning (NOTEARS) to infer causal channel relationships; Hill equation saturation curves to model diminishing returns; robust loss (Huber) and regularization; multi-region framework with shared and region-specific parameters; response-curve analysis and a large visualization suite (14+ dashboards).

Result: The abstract claims improved modeling of temporal dynamics, non-linear channel effects, and causal inference capabilities, plus data-driven hyperparameter estimation, multi-region applicability, robust statistics, and rich visualization.

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM proposes an integrated, data-driven MMM framework that combines deep learning, causal discovery, and saturation modeling to enable more accurate effect estimation and budget optimization across multiple regions, with substantial tooling for interpretation.

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

### [161] [Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112)
*Andrey Bryutkin,Youssef Marzouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse triangular transport maps with MRNN exploit lattice conditional independence to enable scalable, parallelizable normalizing flows for lattice field theories; balances exact vs approximate sparsity to achieve linear-time complexity in lattice size N, evaluated on phi^4 in 2D and compared to HMC and RealNVP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling Boltzmann distributions on lattice field theories is hard due to multimodality and long-range correlations; normalizing flows offer a promising alternative but face memory and expressivity constraints on large lattices.

Method: Introduce sparse triangular transport maps that exploit conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). Develop a framework navigating exact sparsity (respecting marginal conditional independence) and approximate sparsity (tractable with fill-ins). Restrict each triangular map component to a local past to enable site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size N while preserving invertible structure. Use phi^4 theory in two dimensions as a testbed; analyze impact of node labelings (orderings) on sparsity and performance; compare with Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and RealNVP.

Result: Shows a principled trade-off between exact and approximate sparsity, enabling scalable and expressive triangular maps. Local-past restriction yields site-wise parallel evaluation and linear-time scaling in N. Node ordering significantly affects sparsity and performance. Empirical comparisons with HMC and RealNVP illustrate improvements in scalability and sampling efficiency on the chosen testbed.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse triangular transport maps framework enables scalable, expressive normalization flows for lattice field theories by leveraging conditional independence to achieve controllable sparsity. Exact vs approximate sparsity offers a practical trade-off between fidelity and tractability. Node ordering is a key design choice influencing performance; the approach competes with HMC and standard flows, showing promise for large lattices.

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERA provides a principled, abstention-capable framework for reducing LM errors via optimized steering, improving performance and enabling safe abstention, while augmenting existing steering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, manually tuned steering strengths in existing methods often cause under- or oversteering and can degrade performance. There is a need for a principled approach that optimizes the direction of intervention and calibrates when/how much to steer, with an abstention option when corrections are uncertain.

Method: MERA optimizes the intervention direction and calibrates when and how aggressively to steer. It includes an abstention mechanism for when confident correction is not possible. It is designed to improve performance provably and can be applied on top of existing steering techniques. Experiments span diverse datasets and LM families, showing safe, effective, non-degrading error correction and compatibility with other methods.

Result: MERA achieves safe, effective, non-degrading error correction and outperforms existing baselines across datasets and LM families. It also serves as a plug-in to enhance existing steering approaches, demonstrating generality and efficiency.

Conclusion: MERA provides a general-purpose, efficient framework for mechanistic activation steering, enabling optimized intervention and abstention. It can augment existing steering techniques to improve LM error correction without degrading performance.

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

*Jieping Luo,Qiyue Li,Zhizhang Liu,Hang Qi,Jiaying Yin,Jingjin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoDa-FL (Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware Federated Learning) reduces total training time in MEC-based FL with dependent multi-task settings by clustering clients using EMD on data distributions and scheduling dependent tasks via a DAG. It derives a direct relation between intra-cluster EMD and required rounds, achieving faster convergence, lower communication/computation costs, and higher accuracy than benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mobile edge computing environments, FL faces heterogeneity in local data and task dependencies, which prolong training and increase costs. There is a need for a principled framework that leverages data distribution similarity and task dependency to minimize total time to convergence.

Method: Introduce CoDa-FL: cluster-oriented, dependency-aware framework. Use Earth Mover's Distance to cluster clients by local data distributions; perform cluster-based client selection and dependent task assignment; apply directed acyclic graph-based scheduling to manage task dependencies; derive an explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and convergence rounds; validate via numerical experiments.

Result: Derived a direct relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of training rounds for convergence; experiments show CoDa-FL achieves faster convergence, lower communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under heterogeneous MEC settings compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoDa-FL effectively reduces total time to converge in FL with dependent multi-task settings by combining EMD-based clustering and DAG-based task scheduling, offering improved convergence speed, cost efficiency, and accuracy.

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

*Antonio Álvarez-López,Martín Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unbiased dropout-like estimator for continuous-time models using random-batch sampling; establishes trajectory-level (O(h)) and distribution-level (O(h^{1/2})) convergence, Pontryagin adjoint bounds for training, and a closed-form optimal sampling interval h; recovers Bernoulli dropout as a special case and validates on single-layer neural ODEs with practical efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable principled dropout regularization in continuous-time neural dynamics with theoretical guarantees while controlling computational cost by leveraging random-batch sampling (from interacting particle systems).

Method: Introduce an unbiased estimator via neuron batch sampling over time intervals of length h. Provide trajectory-wise convergence with linear rate in h for expected uniform error; prove stability of the associated continuity equation with total-variation error O(h^{1/2}) under mild moment assumptions. For training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, apply Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis to bound deviations in optimal cost and control, and in gradient-descent iterates. Compare convergence rates across canonical batch schemes, show Bernoulli dropout as a special case, derive a cost–accuracy trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal h. Specialize to a single-layer neural ODE and validate predictions on classification and flow matching.

Result: The paper proves linear-in-h trajectory error and O(h^{1/2}) TV stability, provides optimization-trajectory bounds under fixed batching, identifies rate differences among batch schemes, recovers standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derives a closed-form optimal sampling interval h. Empirically, it confirms predicted rates, regularization effects, and efficiency benefits on a single-layer neural ODE.

Conclusion: The work delivers a theoretically grounded dropout mechanism for continuous-time models using random-batch methods, with concrete guidelines (optimal h) and empirical validation, unifying dropout with cost-efficient sampling and enabling scalable regularization in neural ODE contexts.

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

*Nicolas Menet,Aleksandar Terzić,Andreas Krause,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) offers a scalable Bayesian optimization approach for large unstructured discrete spaces by directly modeling the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward, avoiding acquisition-function maximization. It fine-tunes prompt-conditioned large language models to approximate the posterior of maximality, with a variational regret analysis and empirical validation across FAQ refinement, protein search, and quantum circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquisition function maximization in Bayesian optimization is computationally expensive in large discrete, gradient-free spaces. There is a need for a scalable alternative that leverages prior knowledge, such as prompt-conditioned LLMs, to improve sample efficiency without heavy optimization costs.

Method: Introduce ToSFiT: parameterize the probability that a candidate is the maximizer and perform Thompson sampling via online fine-tuning of prompt-conditioned LLMs toward the posterior. Provide a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling and derive a regret bound that matches standard TS guarantees. Emphasize the adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality as central to the algorithm.

Result: Developed theoretical regret bounds for a variational TS that align with standard TS guarantees. Demonstrated that online fine-tuning enhances sample efficiency across three tasks (FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, quantum circuit design) with negligible additional computational cost.

Conclusion: ToSFiT is a scalable, principled approach to Bayesian optimization in large discrete spaces, leveraging online fine-tuning of LLM priors to efficiently approximate the posterior of maximality and achieve improved sample efficiency without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

*Jiacheng Cen,Anyi Li,Ning Lin,Tingyang Xu,Yu Rong,Deli Zhao,Zihe Wang,Wenbing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework for building complete (universally expressive) equivariant GNNs via a canonical scalar form of geometric graphs and a full-rank steerable basis, with an efficient algorithm to instantiate complete GNNs on EGNN and TFN that achieves universality with shallow networks and lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve universal approximation of equivariant functions on graph-structured data while keeping computational efficiency. Prior approaches rely on deeper networks or higher-order features, incurring high costs without polynomial-time guarantees.

Method: The authors prove that completeness can be achieved by combining (1) a complete scalar function termed the canonical form of the geometric graph and (2) a full-rank steerable basis. They then devise an efficient algorithm to construct complete equivariant GNNs, instantiated on two popular models—EGNN and TFN—thereby yielding complete, efficient architectures.

Result: Empirical results indicate superior completeness and strong performance with only a few layers, achieving substantial computational savings while maintaining practical efficacy.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretically grounded, practical framework for complete equivariant GNNs, enabling universal approximation with efficient, shallow networks and offering a scalable path for integrating completeness into common GNN architectures.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

*Yisen Wang,Yichuan Mo,Hongjun Wang,Junyi Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalist partitions adversarial training into multiple specialized base learners, then interpolates them into a global model and periodically redistributes parameters to base learners. This modular approach improves generalization and robustness trade-offs compared to standard AT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial training improves robustness but typically degrades natural accuracy and struggles to transfer robustness across attacks with different norm constraints. A single network with a single objective may underutilize diverse sub-tasks needed for robust generalization. The paper proposes a multi-learner framework to decompose the generalization goal and encourage specialization.

Method: Instantiate a framework with multiple base learners, each focusing on a designated sub-task toward robust generalization. In later training stages, interpolate their parameters to form a global learner, and periodically redistribute the global parameters back to the base learners to keep trajectories aligned. Three variants of Generalist are introduced for different application scenarios.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that Generalist achieves lower generalization error and alleviates the natural accuracy vs. robustness trade-off. It also improves robustness transfer across attacks crafted under different norm constraints, compared with baseline AT methods.

Conclusion: Generalist represents a promising step toward fully robust classifiers by leveraging modular specialization and parameter sharing; decomposing the generalization objective into sub-tasks and periodically merging/splitting parameters helps overcome current AT limitations.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

*Rongrong Xie,Yizhou Xu,Guido Sanguinetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): cross-modal knowledge distillation is effective when mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. Validated theoretically in a joint Gaussian model and empirically across diverse modalities (image, text, video, audio, omics); provides guidelines for selecting optimal teacher modalities to boost weaker modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of theoretical understanding in cross-modal KD by introducing a criterion that predicts when KD will yield improvements and guides the selection of helpful teacher modalities across multimodal settings.

Method: Formulates the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH); derives a mutual-information-based criterion (MI(teacher, student) > MI(student, label)); provides theoretical validation in a joint Gaussian model and empirical validation across multiple multimodal datasets (vision, language, video, audio, and cancer omics).

Result: The CCH criterion is theoretically sound in the Gaussian setting and empirically supported across diverse datasets, offering a practical guideline to choose teacher modalities that maximize cross-modal KD gains for the student.

Conclusion: The work establishes a unifying theoretical framework for cross-modal KD via MI-based criterion and translates this into actionable guidelines for selecting teacher modalities to improve weaker modalities in multimodal learning.

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

*Yasushi Hasegawa,Masayuki Ohzeki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Encoding Boltzmann machines as Ising (-1,+1) vs QUBO (0,1) alters the information geometry and learning dynamics; Ising with SGD converges faster due to more isotropic curvature; QUBO benefits from centering/scaling or natural gradient descent to mitigate curvature pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how representation (Ising vs QUBO) shapes the Fisher information geometry and finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines, and to derive practical guidelines for encoding and preprocessing.

Method: Fix model, sampler, and step size; compare Ising and QUBO encodings using the identity FIM = covariance of sufficient statistics; visualize empirical moments from model samples; analyze cross terms, eigenvalue spectrum, and spectral entropy of the FIM under SGD and natural gradient descent (NGD).

Result: QUBO induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, generating more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy, which explains slower SGD convergence. NGD mitigates these issues by rescaling updates with the FIM, yielding similar convergence across encodings. Ising encoding yields more isotropic curvature under SGD; for QUBO, centering/scaling or NGD preconditioning alleviates curvature pathologies.

Conclusion: Representation choice directly shapes information geometry and training dynamics in Boltzmann machines. The results provide actionable guidelines: prefer Ising encoding for SGD or apply centering/normalization or NGD-style preconditioning with QUBO to improve convergence and training stability.

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

*Jiaxing Deng,Junbiao Pang,Zhicheng Wang,Haitao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised low-rank approach rectifies and aligns GPS points of parking spots by leveraging road-parallel constraints, improving accuracy without labeled data, and releasing data/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS points drift due to tall buildings and low-cost receivers; correcting a subset of erroneous points in large parking-spot datasets is challenging without supervision.

Method: Proposes an unsupervised rectification and alignment framework based on low-rank modeling. It enforces the physical constraint that parking spots are parallel to road sides, treating outliers as corrupted entries and recovering true positions via a low-rank structure.

Result: Experiments on real data show the method outperforms baselines in correcting GPS errors and aligning points to parking spots; dataset and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, effective across different GPS error types, and suitable for practical deployment in parking management and urban planning; it generalizes to other alignment problems with similar physical constraints.

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

### [171] [Towards Understanding Valuable Preference Data for Large Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13212)
*Zizhuo Zhang,Qizhou Wang,Shanshan Ye,Jianing Zhu,Jiangchao Yao,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-point level analysis of LLM preference data shows data quality is model-dependent. The authors propose a truncated influence function (TIF) to measure individual data-point impact, introduce two simpler, model-dependent scoring functions (SFs) correlated with TIF, and combine them to select valuable preference data. Experiments across benchmarks and model families show better alignment with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM alignment via human preferences depends on high-quality data. Existing preprocessing uses external reward models and off-the-shelf LLMs but rarely evaluates whether any given data point truly helps a specific model. Understanding per-data-point influence and model-dependence is crucial to adaptive data selection.

Method: Introduce a truncated influence function (TIF) to estimate a data point's influence on validation performance while mitigating over-scoring. Propose two computationally simpler, model-dependent scoring functions (SFs) that correlate with TIF. Analyze their error behavior relative to TIF, and combine them to create a robust data-selection rule. Validate the approach across diverse alignment benchmarks and multiple LLM families, focusing on data efficiency.

Result: TIF reveals that data point quality is model-dependent; some pairs help one model but hurt another. The proposed SFs are correlated with TIF and, when combined, offset their individual errors. The resulting data-selection rule enables more precise selection of valuable preference data, leading to improved alignment performance with less data across benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: Preference data quality is inherently model-dependent, necessitating adaptive data selection strategies. The authors provide a simple, effective approach using two model-dependent scoring functions and their combination, achieving better alignment with smaller data budgets and generalizing across benchmarks and LLM families.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

*Nico Pelleriti,Christoph Spiegel,Shiwei Liu,David Martínez-Rubio,Max Zimmer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-augmented approach to certify SOS via a Transformer that predicts a near-minimal monomial basis, dramatically shrinking SDP sizes and enabling faster solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certifying polynomial nonnegativity via SOS is NP-hard; SDP size grows quadratically with the monomial basis, making many instances intractable. Reducing basis size promises practical scalability gains.

Method: Generate a dataset of over 100 million SOS polynomials; train a Transformer to predict an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial; integrate a systematic fallback mechanism to guarantee termination; provide theoretical analysis of the fallback.

Result: Validated on over 200 benchmarks, achieving >100× speedups over state-of-the-art solvers and solving instances that competing methods cannot.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable path to significantly improve the practical scalability of SOS programming and highlights the potential of learning-augmented optimization for algebraic certificates.

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

*Haoyu Zhang,Yuxuan Cheng,Wenqi Fan,Yulong Chen,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracNet: Frequency-aware Contrastive Graph Network for domain adaptation that decomposes graphs into high- and low-frequency components and uses contrastive learning to improve transferability and reduce the blurring boundary; supported by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often struggle with domain adaptation due to structural distribution shifts. Spectral analysis suggests low-frequency components encode global, domain-invariant patterns while high-frequency components capture local, domain-specific details. Traditional methods fail to discriminate these, risking loss of informative patterns across layers.

Method: Decompose the input graph into high- and low-frequency components via spectral analysis. Employ two synergic modules that perform frequency-aware domain adaptation on these components. Integrate with a contrastive learning framework to mitigate boundary (blurring) issues in domain adaptation. Provide theoretical guarantees of superiority and validate with extensive experiments.

Result: The approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with rigorous theoretical proofs and empirical validation across datasets.

Conclusion: FracNet effectively leverages spectral decomposition and contrastive learning to enhance domain adaptation in GNNs, offering both theoretical justification and practical gains.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

### [174] [DistilCLIP-EEG: Enhancing Epileptic Seizure Detection Through Multi-modal Learning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13497)
*Zexin Wang,Lin Shi,Haoyu Wu,Junru Luo,Xiangzeng Kong,Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal EEG-text framework, DistilCLIP-EEG, extends CLIP to EEG signals and text descriptions to detect epilepsy. It uses a Conformer-based EEG encoder and Learnable BERT prompts, with cross-modal alignment and knowledge distillation to a smaller student model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most epilepsy detection methods rely on unimodal EEG data. Incorporating multimodal information (EEG + text) can improve representation, robustness, and generalization. A lightweight, distillable model enables deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Propose DistilCLIP-EEG, a CLIP-inspired multimodal model aligning EEG and text embeddings in a shared latent space. EEG encoder uses Conformer architecture; text encoder uses Learnable BERT prompts (BERT-LP). Both components employ prompt learning and are trained with cross-modal contrastive objectives. A teacher–student knowledge distillation framework reduces model size and training complexity, with the teacher guiding a compact student.

Result: On TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both teacher and student achieve accuracy > 97% and F1-scores > 0.94. The student model has about 58.1% of the teacher's parameters, yielding substantial reductions in size while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust, accurate EEG-based epilepsy detection using multimodal EEG-text representations and enables efficient deployment of lightweight models in resource-limited environments through distillation.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

*Daniil Ignatev,Denis Paperno,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hypernetwork+adapters approach for perspectivist classification offers parameter-efficient, architecture-agnostic performance, rivaling specialized models for hate-speech and toxicity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perspective-aware classification often incurs high parameter costs; need a compact, flexible solution that can support multiple user perspectives without large param overhead.

Method: Employ a hypernetwork plus adapters architecture applied to perspectivist classification, making it architecture-agnostic and compatible with various base models; capable of integrating user perspectives for hate speech and toxicity detection.

Result: Delivers competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to specialized models, and stays applicable to a wide range of base architectures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile, parameter-efficient path for perspectivist classification that can be deployed across diverse base models out of the box.

Abstract: The task of perspective-aware classification introduces a bottleneck in terms
of parametric efficiency that did not get enough recognition in existing
studies. In this article, we aim to address this issue by applying an existing
architecture, the hypernetwork+adapters combination, to perspectivist
classification. Ultimately, we arrive at a solution that can compete with
specialized models in adopting user perspectives on hate speech and toxicity
detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out
of the box.

### [176] [Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13512)
*Yulian Wu,Rushil Thareja,Praneeth Vepakomma,Francesco Orabona*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides near-optimal offline and online guarantees for KL-regularized RLHF under epsilon-LDP on human feedback, with a pessimism-based offline algorithm and an optimism-based online algorithm; it also yields first online KL-regularized RLHF analysis without privacy and releases code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL-regularized RLHF is a standard objective in aligning large language models. Introducing epsilon-local differential privacy (LDP) on human preference labels protects user privacy. The work aims to understand sample efficiency and regret in both offline and online RLHF under LDP, and to establish tight (near-optimal) theoretical guarantees.

Method: Offline: develop a pessimism-based algorithm and prove a suboptimality gap of ~ O(1/[(e^ε-1)^2 n]) on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability; provide matching lower bound (optimality) with respect to sample size n. Online: design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound O(d_F log(N_F · T)/(e^ε-1)^2), with T total steps, N_F reward-function space size, and d_F a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. Also show the results imply the first online analysis for KL-regularized RLHF without privacy; implement offline to verify results and release open-source code.

Result: Established tight performance guarantees for both offline and online KL-regularized RLHF under LDP: (i) offline suboptimality gap scales as 1/[(e^ε-1)^2 n] with a matching lower bound, (ii) online regret scales as log-term over (e^ε-1)^2 with a dimension-like complexity d_F and reward-function cardinality N_F, and (iii) a corollary extends to online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: The work provides tight, privacy-aware guarantees for KL-regularized RLHF in both offline and online settings, highlighting the privacy-utility trade-offs through the (e^ε-1)^2 factor, extends to the non-private online setting, and offers an open-source implementation to validate the theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

### [177] [BlendFL: Blended Federated Learning for Handling Multimodal Data Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13266)
*Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares,Omar El-Herraoui,Michail Maniatakos,Farah E. Shamout*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlendFL: a federated learning framework that blends horizontal and vertical FL to address multimodal data heterogeneity, with decentralized inference and adaptive BlendAvg aggregation, achieving superior performance and faster convergence on multimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world FL suffers when data are heterogeneous across modalities and samples; existing horizontal/vertical FL rely on restrictive assumptions and fail when modalities/samples are incomplete. There is a need for a synchronized, non-restrictive framework that supports asymmetric clients and enables efficient inference.

Method: Introduce BlendFL that combines horizontal and vertical FL in a synchronized, non-restrictive manner; any client can leverage either approach or both depending on available data; implement decentralized inference; propose BlendAvg, an adaptive aggregation weighting client updates by performance; evaluate on three classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset and a multimodal benchmark; ablation studies.

Result: BlendFL achieves superior performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification; faster convergence than traditional FL approaches; decentralized inference reduces latency and server reliance; BlendAvg improves aggregation by prioritizing better-performing clients.

Conclusion: BlendFL effectively handles multimodal data heterogeneity in privacy-preserving collaborative learning settings and shows promise for real-world domains like healthcare and finance; potential to be extended to more modalities and datasets, with improved efficiency.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

*Donald Shenaj,Ondrej Bohdal,Taha Ceritli,Mete Ozay,Pietro Zanuttigh,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a data-free, storage-efficient strategy for on-device online continual merging of Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) for LLMs, enabling incorporation of new adapters under a fixed storage budget while preserving performance on previously supported tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device LLMs with LoRAs face limited storage and face incrementally arriving tasks via new LoRAs. There is a need to merge adapters online without degrading performance on earlier tasks and without relying on data-access on-device.

Method: A data-free and computationally efficient approach for selecting and merging a newly available LoRA with existing adapters under a constrained storage budget. The method focuses on choosing which adapters to merge and how to fuse them to maintain prior task performance while accommodating new tasks within storage and compute limits.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world tasks show the proposed strategy outperforms alternative strategies under the same storage and compute constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed data-free online continual merging framework enables effective on-device integration of new LoRAs while preserving previously supported performance within strict storage budgets.

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

*Rui Xu,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-CCP uses locally trained generative models to approximate conditional data distributions and calibrate conformal scores, enabling input-conditional predictive sets in federated CP without sharing raw data; results show more adaptive, locally aware uncertainty sets across heterogeneous clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction assumes i.i.d. data, but federated settings are non-iid across clients. Existing federated CP focuses on marginal coverage, which fails to capture input-conditional uncertainty. There's a need for conditional coverage that adapts to local heterogeneity while preserving privacy.

Method: Each client trains a conditional generative model (e.g., normalizing flows or diffusion models) to approximate conditional distributions of data given inputs. Clients calibrate conformal scores locally using these models and perform federated aggregation to align calibration globally, avoiding sharing raw data.

Result: Experiments on real datasets show Fed-CCP yields more adaptive, input-conditioned prediction sets compared to baseline federated CP methods, indicating improved reflection of local uncertainty.

Conclusion: Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction with generative models provides adaptive conditional coverage in non-iid federated data, maintaining privacy while improving uncertainty quantification; future work may explore scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based downscaling with conformalized quantile regression yields finite-sample calibrated, locally adaptive uncertainty intervals for high-resolution meteorological fields, improving coverage versus standard DM on ERA5 Italy 2-km downscaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMs provide high-fidelity reconstructions and scalable sampling but lack finite-sample calibration; need reliable uncertainty estimates for operational use.

Method: Post-process DM samples to obtain conditional quantiles; apply conformalized quantile regression to obtain locally adaptive, finite-sample valid prediction intervals.

Result: On ERA5 data (Italy), downscaled to 2 km, grid-point uncertainty intervals show improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores compared to DM baseline.

Conclusion: Conformalized generative models offer trustworthy probabilistic downscaling for high-resolution meteorological fields, enhancing reliability for forecasting and energy applications.

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test using triangles, yielding EB-GNN; more expressive than 1-WL, with near-linear time/memory; empirically efficient and competitive with specialized GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the expressiveness gap of 1-WL in graph representation learning while remaining scalable to large graphs by leveraging triangle-based refinement inspired by a classic triangle-counting algorithm.

Method: Introduce EB-1WL (edge-based 1-WL) and EB-GNN that explicitly uses triangles in message passing; derives a complete logical characterization via first-order logic; achieves near-linear time and memory on practical tasks.

Result: EB-1WL is strictly more expressive than 1-WL; complete logical and homomorphism-based characterization; near-linear time/memory; EB-GNN outperforms simple MPNNs and remains competitive with task-specific GNNs while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed edge-based, triangle-informed refinement offers a practically scalable path to more expressive GNNs, backed by solid theoretical characterization and favorable empirical performance.

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

*Yang Cao,Sikun Yang,Hao Tian,Kai He,Lianyong Qi,Ming Liu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ISER is an isolation-based ensemble method that uses hypersphere radii as proxies for local density, coupled with a similarity-based scoring against a theoretical anomaly pattern, to deliver scalable, density-aware anomaly detection that improves Isolation Forest; it outperforms 11 baselines across 22 real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised anomaly detectors face conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and limited ability to handle diverse anomaly types; a scalable, density-aware approach is needed to improve robustness and performance.

Method: Extend isolation-based methods by representing local densities with hypersphere radii within ensemble representations; introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that compares ensemble patterns to a theoretical anomaly reference pattern; adapt the scoring function to mitigate axis-parallel bias and enhance local anomaly detection, and integrate these ideas to improve Isolation Forest.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets show ISER achieves superior performance compared with 11 baseline methods.

Conclusion: ISER provides a scalable, density-aware enhancement to Isolation Forest, offering improved robustness across anomaly types and maintaining linear time and constant space complexity.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

TL;DR: The abstract analyzes TSFM evaluation challenges, identifying data leakage, representativeness issues, and memorization risks, and argues for out-of-sample, future-data benchmarking with robust methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the integrity and reliability of TSFM benchmarking as models move toward zero-shot forecasting, preventing inflated estimates and inappropriate transfer of global knowledge.

Method: Critical survey of existing TSFM evaluation practices; identifies issues such as benchmark representativeness, lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, data overlap, and memorization of global shocks; proposes principled evaluation directions (e.g., evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data).

Result: Findings indicate confusion about data partitions, inflated performance estimates, and misapplication of global patterns to local time series; highlighting the need for robust evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: Calls for the development of principled, robust evaluation designs and methodologies that rely on truly out-of-sample future data to safeguard TSFM assessment integrity.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

*Alexander Gräfe,Fabian Mager,Marco Zimmerling,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RockNet enables on-device, end-to-end training of time-series classifiers on ultra-low-power microcontrollers via distributed ML and optimized wireless communication, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantial energy/memory savings across 1–20 devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for privacy-preserving, low-latency ML in Cyber-Physical Systems. Ultra-low-power MCUs cannot afford cloud-based training or offline pretraining, yet practical on-device training is desirable for responsiveness and security.

Method: A distributed learning framework that trains lightweight classifiers across multiple devices, minimizing communication overhead and using tailored wireless multi-hop protocols. Implemented on a 20-device hardware testbed to enable training from scratch without offline pretraining.

Result: Hardware experiments show RockNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for time-series classification, surpassing the latest neural-network MCU-training methods by up to 2x, and reduces per-device memory, latency, and energy by up to 90% when scaling from 1 to 20 devices.

Conclusion: Tight integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication makes end-to-end on-device training feasible for ultra-low-power hardware with competitive accuracy, addressing a key bottleneck in TinyML for CPS.

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Hyunsu Kim,Jonggeon Park,Joan Bruna,Hongseok Yang,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dimension-agnostic neural network, named Axial Neural Network (XNN), generalizes across varying tensor dimensions for PDE foundation models and demonstrates competitive performance with original models while offering superior generalization to unseen dimensions, underscoring the value of multidimensional pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE data present varying dimensionalities across systems, which traditional PDE foundation models handle poorly by fixing a maximum dimension or using separate encoders. This leads to inefficiency and limited generalization.

Method: Introduce Axial Neural Network (XNN) inspired by parameter-sharing architectures like Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks to be dimension-agnostic. Convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks. Evaluate under three training regimes: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE.

Result: XNNs perform competitively with the original PDE foundation models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions. Multidimensional pretraining enhances foundation-model capabilities for handling PDE data with varying dimensionalities.

Conclusion: Dimension-agnostic architectures like XNN are effective for physics data with varying dimensions, and multidimensional pretraining is important for robust foundation models in this domain.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

### [186] [When In Doubt, Abstain: The Impact of Abstention on Strategic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13327)
*Lina Alkarmi,Ziyuan Huang,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Abstention in strategic classification can improve or match the classifier's outcome and deter manipulation by strategically acting agents in a Stackelberg game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate vulnerability of algorithmic decision-making to strategic manipulation and to understand how abstention affects agents' responses and the principal's optimal policy.

Method: Analytical modeling of binary classifiers in a Stackelberg framework where agents manipulate observable features; analysis of abstention's impact on principal's utility and manipulation cost.

Result: Optimal abstention yields principal utility no worse than in a non-abstaining setting; abstention can deter manipulation when manipulation costs are sufficiently high, especially for less qualified agents.

Conclusion: Abstention is a valuable tool to reduce harms from strategic behavior beyond accuracy gains, offering a deterrent effect and robustness.

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

*Yang Cao,Sikun Yang,Kai He,Wenjun Ma,Ming Liu,Yujiu Yang,Jian Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A proximity kernel computes similarity directly between incomplete data in kernel space without imputation, using data-dependent binning and proximity assignment with a cascading fallback for missing values; demonstrates strong clustering on 12 real incomplete datasets with linear time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete data cause information loss and biased similarity estimates when using traditional imputation or discarding missing values; there is a need for a native, scalable similarity measure that handles missingness.

Method: Introduce a proximity kernel that projects data into a high-dimensional sparse kernel feature space via data-dependent binning and proximity assignment, enabling direct similarity computation on incomplete data without imputing original features. Handle missing features with a cascading fallback strategy to estimate feature distributions. Achieves linear time complexity.

Result: Clustering experiments on 12 real-world incomplete datasets show superior performance of the proximity kernel over existing methods while preserving linear time complexity. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: The proximity kernel provides an effective, scalable approach for measuring similarity with incomplete data, reducing information loss and bias, and is applicable to web mining, recommendations, and user behavior analysis.

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

### [188] [Contrastive Learning-Based Dependency Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13368)
*Yue Xing,Yingnan Deng,Heyao Liu,Ming Wang,Yun Zi,Xiaoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dependency-aware anomaly detection framework for cloud services that uses graph-based representations, contrastive learning, and temporal consistency to robustly identify anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud environments exhibit intricate service dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns. Traditional methods struggle with noise, sparse labels, and short-term fluctuations, necessitating a robust, context-aware representation and learning approach.

Method: Construct a dependency graph of service interactions; extract temporal and structural features via embedding functions; apply graph convolution to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations; use contrastive learning with carefully formed positive/negative pairs to separate normal from abnormal patterns; impose a temporal consistency constraint to stabilize representations over time and mitigate short-term fluctuations; optimize by combining contrastive loss with temporal consistency loss.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing methods on key metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC) across public datasets; maintains robustness under sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations; validated across hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: Integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning yields a complete, adaptable solution for cloud service anomaly detection with stable performance in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

### [189] [Prediction Markets with Intermittent Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13385)
*Michael Vitali,Pierre Pinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible prediction-market design that adapts to changing conditions, handles missing data, and supports agent turnover, using robust regression to combine forecasts and a payoff mechanism with favorable economic properties; validated with simulations and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data ownership and competitive interests limit data sharing; existing cooperative-game approaches are narrow. Prediction markets offer a general framework where independent agents trade forecasts and are rewarded for information, enabling collaborative forecasting under constraints.

Method: Propose a market where agents trade forecasts; incorporate historical performance to weight forecasts; adapt to time-varying conditions; allow agents to enter/exit freely. Use robust regression to learn the optimal forecast combination and handle missing submissions. Develop a payoff allocation mechanism that factors in both in-sample and out-of-sample performance and satisfies several desirable economic properties.

Result: Case studies with simulated and real-world data demonstrate the market’s effectiveness and adaptability. The design handles missing submissions, accommodates dynamic participation, and yields reliable forecast aggregation and payoff allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed market offers a practical, adaptable framework for collaborative forecasting under data constraints, extending beyond fixed cooperative settings and with potential for broader application and extensions.

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

### [190] [Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391)
*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learning-based GNN approach to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games, enabling zero-shot generalization and significant speedups over exact/sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of Banzhaf values scales exponentially with the number of agents, making it intractable for large systems. Monte Carlo sampling is noisy and lacks transferability across networks. A scalable, transferable predictor could enable practical analysis in dynamic, large-scale networks.

Method: Formulates Banzhaf value estimation as a graph-level prediction task. Evaluates three GNN architectures (GAT, GINE, EdgeConv) on a large synthetic dataset (200k graphs per configuration, sizes 20–100 nodes, 5–20 agents, edge probability 0.5–1.0). Trains on topology/control features to predict Banzhaf values, then tests fidelity, speed, and zero-shot generalization to unseen network sizes/topologies.

Result: GNN models deliver high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximations with order-of-magnitude speedups over exact and sampling-based methods. Models show strong zero-shot generalization, accurately predicting values for networks with different structure without retraining.

Conclusion: GNNs are a practical tool for scalable, transferable cooperative game-theoretic analysis in complex networked systems, enabling fast and generalizable estimation of agent influence in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

*Devvrit Khatri,Lovish Madaan,Rishabh Tiwari,Rachit Bansal,Sai Surya Duvvuri,Manzil Zaheer,Inderjit S. Dhillon,David Brandfonbrener,Rishabh Agarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale study (400k+ GPU-hours) establishes a principled framework for scaling RL in LLMs, introducing ScaleRL, and showing how design choices affect efficiency and asymptotic performance, enabling predictable extrapolation of RL performance across compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL scaling for LLMs lacks principled predictive methodologies akin to pre-training scaling. As compute budgets grow, it is unclear how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute or how to extrapolate from small runs to large-scale training.

Method: Conducted a large-scale systematic study (>400k GPU-hours) to fit sigmoidal compute–performance curves for RL training. Ablated a broad set of design choices (loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, off-policy algorithms) to assess their impact on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. Developed a best-practice scaling recipe, ScaleRL, and validated by scaling a run to 100k GPU-hours to predict validation performance.

Result: Key findings: (1) Different RL recipes yield different asymptotic performance; (2) Factors like loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithms mainly affect compute efficiency rather than shifting the asymptote; (3) Stable, scalable recipes exhibit predictable scaling trajectories enabling extrapolation from smaller runs. The work proposes ScaleRL as a practical recipe and demonstrates its predictive power by scaling and predicting validation performance up to 100k GPU-hours.

Conclusion: Provides a scientific framework for analyzing RL scaling and a practical recipe that improves predictability of RL training outcomes with compute, bringing RL scaling closer to the predictability enjoyed in pre-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

### [192] [Assessing the robustness of heterogeneous treatment effects in survival analysis under informative censoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13397)
*Yuxin Wang,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Maresa Schröder,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an assumption-lean partial identification framework and a novel meta-learner to bound CATE under informative censoring in survival data, enabling robust subgroup identification where treatment is effective despite dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dropout in clinical studies often causes informative censoring, biasing survival analysis and treatment effect estimates. Existing methods rely on strong assumptions like non-informative censoring; there is a need for robustness tools that can still draw credible conclusions under censoring.

Method: Develop a partial-identification-based approach to derive bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under censoring bias. Introduce a meta-learner that can estimate these bounds with arbitrary ML models, exhibiting double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency.

Result: Through simulations and an application to a cancer drug trial, the method provides informative CATE bounds and demonstrates practical value for assessing robustness of survival-treatment effects under informative censoring.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, assumption-lean tool for robustness assessment of survival treatment effects, promoting reliable evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology by focusing on bounds rather than potentially biased point estimates.

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

*Ziqing Lu,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents an information-theoretic rate-distortion attack on RL that hides the true transition kernel from the learner, yielding provable regret bounds and breaking both model-based and model-free RL, with extensions to state observation attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness of RL against adversaries; address limitations of deterministic attacks; provide provable guarantees on attack efficacy and explore broader attack space.

Method: Use rate-distortion theory to randomly perturb observations of the transition kernel and related properties, deriving a lower bound on reward regret for the victim agent; analyze effects on various RL algorithms; extend the framework to state observation attacks.

Result: Derives an information-theoretic lower bound on regret under such attacks; shows substantial impact on state-of-the-art algorithms; demonstrates generality across model-based/model-free and observation-attacks.

Conclusion: Introduces invincible/uncounterable attack paradigm for RL; suggests new defense directions and further extensions to other attack types; emphasizes need for robust RL design.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

*Muhammad Ishfaq Hussain,Ma Van Linh,Zubia Naz,Unse Fatima,Yeongmin Ko,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic SWIR-like cues from LWIR are generated and fused with RGB and LWIR in a modality-specific encoder–decoder network with a softmax-gated fusion head; shows improved fusion quality with real-time performance on RGB-LWIR benchmarks and a private RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse visibility challenges in surveillance and autonomous navigation; SWIR offers advantages but public SWIR datasets are scarce. Synthetic SWIR cues enable tri-modal fusion without full spectral reproduction, aiming to improve scene understanding under low illumination or atmospheric disturbances.

Method: 1) Synthesize SWIR-like structural/contrast cues from LWIR using contrast enhancement (no spectral reproduction claimed). 2) Build a multimodal fusion framework with modality-specific encoders for synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB, plus a decoder; employ a softmax-gated fusion head to combine features. 3) Compare against trimodal baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded variants of U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. 4) Evaluate on public RGB-LWIR benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and a private RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset; assess fused image quality and real-time performance.

Result: The proposed framework improves fused-image quality in terms of contrast, edge definition, and structural fidelity, while maintaining real-time processing. It outperforms baselines in the reported experiments and demonstrates robust performance across both public benchmarks and the private dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic SWIR cues integrated into a tri-modal fusion framework offer substantial potential for real-world surveillance and autonomous navigation applications, enabling better scene understanding in adverse conditions and paving the way for broader adoption of SWIR-enhanced fusion systems.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

*Chen Gong,Yan Zhuang,Zhenzhe Zheng,Yiliu Chen,Sheng Wang,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaLog reduces on-device user-behavior logs by 19-44% using hypergraph-based feature redundancy elimination, virtual hashing for dense multi-file storage, and incremental updates, achieving low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising ML in mobile apps requires large user-behavior data; storage cost degrades latency and increases uninstalls; need on-device, storage-efficient logging without hurting model performance.

Method: Formulate feature-level redundancy as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs with a hierarchical on-device algorithm; design virtually hashed attribute layout to split heterogeneous behaviors into few dense log files; incremental update mechanism to adapt logs with minimal I/O; prototype and real-world deployment with industry partner.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real user data shows 19-44% log size reduction with only ~2s extra latency and ~15 MB memory overhead; maintains model inference accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: AdaLog provides a practical, scalable approach to on-device ML data logging, balancing storage efficiency with performance, enabling broader deployment of on-device ML.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device

### [196] [When Embedding Models Meet: Procrustes Bounds and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13406)
*Lucas Maystre,Alvaro Ortega Gonzalez,Charles Park,Rares Dolga,Tudor Berariu,Yu Zhao,Kamil Ciosek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two embedding spaces obtained from similar data can be aligned with a near-orthogonal transform if their pairwise dot products are approximately preserved; Procrustes post-processing yields a simple, geometry-preserving alignment with a tight error bound, validated across retraining compatibility, cross-model text retrieval, and mixed-modality search (achieving state-of-the-art in the latter).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding models trained independently often capture stable information but remain non-interoperable. Aligning them enables practical workflows: compatibility across retrainings, upgrading parts of models, and effective multimodal search.

Method: The paper proves that near-preservation of pairwise dot products implies the existence of a close-to-orthogonal isometry between embedding sets, with a tight bound on alignment error. It then applies Procrustes post-processing to compute the optimal orthogonal transformation, thereby aligning the spaces while preserving their geometry.

Result: Theoretical bound on alignment error is established. Empirically, Procrustes alignment improves interoperability across retrainings, enables combining different text retrieval models, and enhances mixed-modality search, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the multimodal setting.

Conclusion: Orthogonal (Procrustes) alignment provides a simple, geometry-preserving solution for interoperating independently trained embedding spaces, with practical benefits across retraining, model fusion, and multimodal search.

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [197] [Modeling Adoptive Cell Therapy in Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data using PINNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13431)
*Kayode Olumoyin,Katarzyna Rejniak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs extended with biological priors to learn time-varying interactions in combination therapy for tumor dynamics, effective with sparse oncology data, yielding both the ODE solution and time-varying parameters; shows strong convergence on MSE/MAE/MAPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle sparse, time-point-limited oncology data and infer dynamic treatment effects by embedding known biological constraints into learning, enabling robust inference of time-varying interactions in tumor microenvironments.

Method: Modify PINN to incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization terms; apply to an ODE model of intermittent combination therapy; train a neural network to fit data while enforcing physics-based and biological priors, yielding both state trajectories and time-varying parameters.

Result: The approach converges strongly, generalizes from few training examples, and achieves low error metrics (MSE, MAE, MAPE). It also recovers time-varying ODE parameters and the ODE solution.

Conclusion: Extends PINNs for oncology by integrating biological priors, enabling accurate inference from sparse data and time-varying treatment effects; demonstrates potential for modeling tumor-therapy dynamics under intermittent treatment.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

### [198] [Hybrid Interval Type-2 Mamdani-TSK Fuzzy System for Regression Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13437)
*Ashish Bhatia,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,Vito De Feo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel fuzzy regression method blending Mamdani interpretability with TSK precision via a hybrid rule structure and dual dominance, achieving improved RMSE and interpretability across several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the interpretability–accuracy trade-off in regression amid uncertainty and imprecision; leverage fuzzy systems to combine interpretable rules with data-driven precision while mitigating overfitting on small datasets.

Method: Hybrid Mamdani-TSK fuzzy regression with a rule structure that includes fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types; evaluated on six benchmark datasets; compared to baseline models using RMSE and a 'fuzzy methodology score' as metrics; reported improvements.

Result: Best fuzzy methodology score in 4 of 6 datasets; outperformed opaque models in 2 datasets; achieved the best overall score in 1 dataset; RMSE improvements reported from 0.4% to 19%.

Conclusion: The approach offers a balanced solution to the interpretability–accuracy dilemma in fuzzy regression by preserving interpretable Mamdani-like rules while enhancing precision via TSK components; shows competitive performance on multiple datasets and potential for robust, explainable predictive modeling.

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

*Masahiro Fujisawa,Futoshi Futami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2-regularized ERM directly controls smooth calibration error (smCE) with finite-sample guarantees in RKHS settings, eliminating the need for post-hoc calibration or specialized calibration-promoting regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of predicted probabilities is crucial for reliable ML, but its theoretical link to standard training procedures is poorly understood. This work provides the first theory showing that canonical L2-regularized ERM can bound calibration error, offering a principled path to well-calibrated models without extra calibration steps.

Method: Derives finite-sample generalization bounds for smCE that depend on optimization error, regularization strength, and the Rademacher complexity. Instantiates the theory for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to obtain concrete guarantees for kernel ridge and logistic regression, with empirical validation and released code.

Result: Finite-sample bounds on smCE; concrete calibration guarantees for kernel ridge and logistic regression; experiments corroborate the theory; codebase available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Shows that standard L2-regularized ERM can yield well-calibrated models without boosting or post-hoc recalibration, offering theoretical justification for calibration through typical ERM and highlighting practical applicability in kernel methods.

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source

### [200] [Towards Blackwell Optimality: Bellman Optimality Is All You Can Get](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13476)
*Victor Boone,Adrienne Tuynman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies identifying policy optimality orders in MDPs (average gain, bias, Blackwell) by designing learning algorithms with vanishing error for each order, characterizes when finite-time identification is possible (iff there is a unique Bellman optimal policy), and provides a tractable stopping rule that triggers in finite time when identification is feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Average-gain optimality is asymptotic; incorporating immediate losses yields a hierarchy of bias-based optimalities (up to Blackwell). There is a need to know when policies of a given order can be identified and when the process can stop with certainty.

Method: For each optimality order, develop a learning algorithm with vanishing probability of error. Characterize the MDPs where the identification process can terminate in finite time (these are MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, independent of the order). Propose a tractable stopping rule that, when combined with the learning algorithms, ensures finite-time termination whenever identification is possible.

Result: Existence of order-specific learning procedures with vanishing error probability. A complete finite-time stopping criterion is provided for the class of MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy. The proposed stopping rule is tractable and guarantees finite-time stopping when feasible.

Conclusion: Identification of optimality-order policies is achievable under the stated conditions. Finite-time stopping is guaranteed precisely for MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and the stopping rule provides a practical mechanism to decide when to stop in finite time.

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LLMs lag due to data quality/availability, tokenizer mismatches, and gaps in evaluation frameworks; improving transparency and collaboration can accelerate progress.

Method: 1) Develop a protocol for collecting and filtering Arabic pretraining data; 2) empirically assess the impact of different tokenizer designs on model performance; 3) critique current Arabic evaluation frameworks and propose a systematic corrective methodology; 4) share data and methodologies publicly to enable replication and collaboration.

Result: Finds that tokenizer design choices markedly influence Arabic LLM performance; identifies shortcomings in existing Arabic evaluation benchmarks; proposes a corrective methodology and commits to releasing data/methodologies.

Conclusion: Transparent sharing and a systematic, data-driven approach can accelerate progress in Arabic language modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural
language processing, enhancing capabilities in both language understanding and
generation across diverse domains. However, developing LLMs for Arabic presents
unique challenges. This paper explores these challenges by focusing on critical
aspects such as data curation, tokenizer design, and evaluation. We detail our
approach to the collection and filtration of Arabic pre-training datasets,
assess the impact of various tokenizer designs on model performance, and
examine the limitations of existing Arabic evaluation frameworks, for which we
propose a systematic corrective methodology. To promote transparency and
facilitate collaborative development, we share our data and methodologies,
contributing to the advancement of language modeling, particularly for the
Arabic language.

*Martin Licht,Sara Ketabi,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTopic uses prototypical networks for topic modeling on medical abstracts to enable few-shot topic generation with improved coherence and diversity over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical text often suffers from data scarcity per topic, making traditional topic models brittle. There is a need for effective, data-efficient topic modeling in healthcare.

Method: Leverage prototypical networks to create topic prototypes and compute distances between medical abstract representations and prototypes to generate and assign topics, enabling few-shot topic modeling for a set of medical paper abstracts.

Result: ProtoTopic reports higher topic coherence and diversity than two standard baselines, demonstrating effective topic generation with limited data and medical relevance.

Conclusion: ProtoTopic shows that prototypical networks are a viable, explainable, and data-efficient approach for topic modeling in medical text, suitable for low-resource healthcare domains.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

### [203] [Multi-Objective $\textit{min-max}$ Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13560)
*Rahul Vaze,Sumiran Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a multi-objective online convex optimization (OCO) framework with K i.i.d. loss sequences and a min-max regret criterion, and presents a simple Hedge+Online Gradient Descent algorithm achieving an expected regret of O(sqrt(T log K)).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend online learning to settings where several loss sequences must be tracked simultaneously; the performance metric (min-max regret) guards against worst-case misalignment with any single sequence, providing robust performance across all K sequences.

Method: Formulates multi-objective OCO with K loss sequences and a static offline benchmark that minimizes the maximum total loss across sequences. Proposes a simple algorithm that blends Hedge (for selecting among the K sequences) and Online Gradient Descent (for action updates) under an i.i.d. loss model from an unknown distribution.

Result: The proposed Hedge+OGD algorithm achieves an expected min-max regret of O(sqrt(T log K)) in the i.i.d. setting.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that multi-objective OCO with a min-max criterion can be effectively handled with a simple, scalable algorithm, with regret growing sublinearly in T and only logarithmically in the number of sequences K, under i.i.d. assumptions.

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOLFIN enables privacy-preserving federated continual learning with low communication via online LoRA adapters and DualGPM, achieving superior final accuracy on multiple benchmarks with comparable memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated continual learning faces a trade-off among performance, privacy, and communication; existing methods struggle to balance these under client heterogeneity.

Method: Use Vision Transformers with orthogonal low-rank adapters (LoRA) to minimize communication, combined with DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to mitigate forgetting; evaluate under Dirichlet heterogeneity on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200, comparing to six strong baselines.

Result: DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in final average accuracy while maintaining similar memory footprint across datasets and heterogeneity settings.

Conclusion: Orthogonal low-rank adapters offer an effective, scalable solution for privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings; DOLFIN is a robust approach for federated incremental tasks.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

*Ivan Dubrovsky,Anastasia Orlova,Illarion Iov,Nina Gubina,Irena Gureeva,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective adversarial perturbations on MMLU exist and can materially alter model rankings, challenging fairness and reproducibility of LLM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark evaluations guide trust and deployment of LLMs; semantically equivalent perturbations that selectively affect some models threaten fairness and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation.

Method: Utilize canonical attacks within the TextAttack framework to establish a protocol for selectivity assessment; introduce a custom constraint to increase attack selectivity; propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline to generate selective perturbations.

Result: Selective adversarial attacks exist and can meaningfully shift relative model rankings on MMLU, altering comparative judgments.

Conclusion: Prompt robustness diagnostics and perturbation-aware reporting are needed to preserve fairness and reliability in LLM evaluation; even subtle edits can change outcomes.

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArtNet is an artificial netlist generator that preserves topological characteristics to improve ML generalization and DTCO workflows, boosting dataset realism and PPA exploration; achieves CNN DRV prediction F1 improvement of 0.16 and up to 97.94% PPA match for mini-brains in DTCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottlenecks in ML/DTCO for advanced-node IC design: limited diverse training data and long design flow turnaround times, which hinder PPA optimization and design exploration.

Method: Introduce ArtNet, an artificial netlist generator that replicates key topological characteristics to produce realistic artificial datasets, enabling better ML generalization and broader design space exploration; use data augmentation for CNN-based DRV prediction and DTCO mini-brains to approximate full-scale PPA metrics.

Result: CNN-based DRV prediction performance improves (F1 score by 0.16) over using only real data; DTCO mini-brains achieve PPA match up to 97.94% with target full-scale block designs.

Conclusion: ArtNet enables more efficient PPA optimization and DTCO exploration by generating realistic artificial datasets that better reflect target parameters and design metrics.

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based SEEG channel selector (EEGChaT) uses Channel Aggregation Tokens and enhanced Attention Rollout to identify task-relevant channels, boosting decoding accuracy (up to 17% absolute) and aligning with expert-chosen channels on DuIN data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG data have many channels with varying relevance, making scalable, interpretable channel selection hard. Traditional methods struggle with high dimensionality and interpretability; a learned, interpretable selector could improve BCI performance and provide neuroscience insights.

Method: Introduce EEGChaT, a Transformer-based channel selection module. It uses Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to fuse information across channels and an improved Attention Rollout to derive quantitative, interpretable channel importance scores. The module can be integrated with existing classifiers and evaluated on the DuIN SEEG dataset.

Result: EEGChaT integration yields up to 17 percentage-point absolute gains in decoding accuracy. The channel importance weights correlate substantially with manually selected channels, supporting interpretability. The approach is presented as generalizable for high-dimensional SEEG analysis.

Conclusion: EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for SEEG channel selection, offering both improved performance and insight into neural signal relevance.

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a physics-augmented, geometry-aware multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) to model high-dimensional spatiotemporal data on complex geometries, enforcing physical laws via regularization; validated on 3D cardiac electrodynamics with superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and coupling across multiple interrelated physical variables hinder accurate modeling; there is a need to leverage geometric priors and governing physics.

Method: Develop a geometry-aware multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) to capture intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies, and apply a physics-based regularization to ensure predictions comply with governing dynamical principles; validate on 3D cardiac electrodynamics data.

Result: Numerical experiments show significant improvement over existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical constraints and geometric priors.

Conclusion: The P-M-GP framework effectively fuses geometric priors with physical laws to enhance predictions for complex spatiotemporal systems and holds potential for broader applications beyond cardiac modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

### [209] [Towards Robust Knowledge Removal in Federated Learning with High Data Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13606)
*Riccardo Santi,Riccardo Salami,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a rapid, communication-efficient method for removing a client's influence from a model in distributed privacy-preserving learning using Task Arithmetic and Neural Tangent Kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of portable devices enables distributed AI with privacy constraints. Regulatory and safety requirements now mandate removing a client's contribution to a model. Traditional removal methods require many communication rounds, delaying model usefulness and potentially harming system performance; thus a fast, efficacious, time-bounded removal is needed.

Method: Introduce a workflow based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to eliminate a client's influence from a model with minimal communication rounds, aiming for rapid removal while preserving model accuracy.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual method and does not report empirical results; it proposes a novel approach rather than providing experimental validation.

Conclusion: A novel approach combining Task Arithmetic and NTK to enable rapid, efficient removal of a client's influence in distributed learning, reducing communication overhead and preserving model availability during the removal process.

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

TL;DR: This work introduces neural decoders for classical NLDR methods to enable bidirectional mapping and adds a diffusion-based generative process within the learned manifolds.

Motivation: Classical NLDR techniques (e.g., t-SNE, Isomap, LLE) excel at visualization but provide only one-way mappings. A bidirectional, generative-capable framework would extend their utility to tasks like data reconstruction and synthesis.

Method: Propose a systematic framework for building neural decoder architectures that map NLDR embeddings back to the high-dimensional space. Extend the framework with a diffusion-based generative process operating directly in the learned NLDR manifolds.

Result: On CelebA, decoders can reconstruct data but underperform compared with end-to-end optimized autoencoders. A diffusion process constrained to NLDR manifolds yields low-quality samples. The discrete, sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings appears ill-suited for the smooth interpolation required by generative models.

Conclusion: Retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods is challenging. The framework highlights fundamental trade-offs and limitations, suggesting that NMDR-focused visualization techniques are not readily compatible with high-quality generative modeling without addressing the discrete nature and embedding sparsity.

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gate-based quantum reservoir computing for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) using paired injection and memory qubits and a Trotterized transverse-field Ising evolution, achieving competitive MSE on Lorenz-63 and ENSO and tolerating hardware noise, suggesting practicality of QRC on NISQ devices and inviting study of noise as a possible regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend quantum reservoir computing to multivariate time series and make it compatible with near-term quantum hardware constraints, addressing prior focus on univariate signals and idealized hardware.

Method: Gate-based QRC with injection and memory qubits, evolving under a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising model optimized for current device connectivity and depth; evaluation on benchmark MTS datasets (Lorenz-63, ENSO) and hardware experiments on IBM devices (Heron R2).

Result: MSEs of 0.0087 (Lorenz-63) and 0.0036 (ENSO); performance comparable to classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both datasets; in some settings NVAR and clustered ESN outperform. On IBM Heron R2, maintained accuracy with realistic depths and, notably, outperformed a noiseless simulator on ENSO. Singular value analysis suggests device noise concentrates variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime.

Conclusion: Gate-based QRC is a practical approach for multivariate time-series forecasting on NISQ hardware; hardware noise may benefit QRC readouts, warranting systematic studies on when and how noise enhances QRC performance.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

*Damek Davis,Benjamin Recht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL algorithms for large language models with binary rewards can be understood as stochastic gradient ascent on monotone transforms of the probability of a correct answer; rejection sampling uses a log transform, GRPO uses arcsin(sqrt).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose a unifying mathematical structure behind popular RL methods (e.g., RLHF-style updates) operating on binary rewards, enabling comparison and principled design of new methods.

Method: Reinterpret the update rules of rejection sampling and GRPO as SGD on a monotone transform of P(correct|prompt). Identify the exact transforms: log for rejection sampling and arcsin(sqrt) for GRPO, showing equivalence between their updates and the gradient of the transformed objective.

Result: A common framework is established: the updates of these algorithms correspond to gradient ascent on monotone transforms of the probability of a correct answer, with rejection sampling using the logarithm transform and GRPO using the arcsin(sqrt) transform.

Conclusion: This unifies disparate RL methods under a single mathematical lens, suggesting that choice of transform governs update dynamics and potential stability, and guiding the design of new reward-modified algorithms by selecting appropriate monotone transforms.

Abstract: We show that several popular algorithms for reinforcement learning in large
language models with binary rewards can be viewed as stochastic gradient ascent
on a monotone transform of the probability of a correct answer given a prompt.
In particular, the transformation associated with rejection sampling algorithms
is the logarithm and that associated with the GRPO algorithm is the arcsine of
the square root.

*Priyobrata Mondal,Faizanuddin Ansari,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distribution calibration-based method (RCS) for imbalanced classification that uses calibrated Gaussian mixtures and an encoder-decoder to generate synthetic samples and reduce bias toward the majority class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance and the risk of overgeneralization when minority class statistics are approximated solely from the majority class distribution; calibrate minority distributions using neighboring regions and a mixture model.

Method: Propose Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS). It estimates minority distribution parameters via weighted parameters from a mixture of Gaussian components drawn from both majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is trained to preserve data structure and prevent disentanglement. After training, encoder features are used to generate synthetic samples through a distribution calibration process that leverages neighboring regions.

Result: Empirical results show superior classification performance compared with several baselines and state-of-the-art methods across diverse image, text, and tabular datasets.

Conclusion: RCS effectively mitigates overgeneralization by calibrating minority-class distributions using information from neighboring regions and a mixture-model approach, offering robust improvements across multiple modalities.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

*Bingbin Liu,Rachit Bansal,Depen Morwani,Nikhil Vyas,David Alvarez-Melis,Sham M. Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal preconditioners approximating second-order optimizers (Adam vs Gauss-Newton) behave differently depending on the basis used and gradient noise. In full-batch, Adam can outperform GN-based diagonals; in stochastic settings, Adam resembles GN^{-1/2}. Empirical results validate theory on convex and non-convex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand trade-offs between Adam-style gradient-statistics diagonals and GN-based diagonals, focusing on basis choice and mini-batch gradient noise, to guide preconditioner selection in practice.

Method: Theoretical analysis on quadratic objectives and logistic regression across four quadrants; comparison of Adam, GN^{-1}, and GN^{-1/2} under full-batch and stochastic regimes; examination of basis choices for diagonal preconditioners; empirical experiments on convex and non-convex objectives to corroborate theory.

Result: There exist instances where Adam outperforms both GN^{-1} and GN^{-1/2} in full-batch regardless of the basis. In the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN^{-1/2} for linear regression under Gaussian data.

Conclusion: Basis choice influences performance but does not override the intrinsic differences between Adam and GN diagonals. Diagonal preconditioners offer complementary strengths: Adam may be preferable in full-batch, while in stochastic training Adam and GN^{-1/2} converge to similar behavior. The findings are supported by experiments on convex and non-convex objectives.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

*Yuchun Miao,Liang Ding,Sen Zhang,Rong Bao,Lefei Zhang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward-modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck to reduce reward hacking in RLHF by filtering out preference-irrelevant information. Adds IBL, a distribution-level regularization, and MOP, a statistical outlier metric; proves IB-space equivalence to pessimistic RL; demonstrates empirical gains and a diagnostic tool for hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking in RLHF persists due to reward misgeneralization (overfitting to spurious features) and lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization. Existing token-level constraints over-constrain policies. There is a need for a principled, scalable approach to filter irrelevant information and regulate optimization.

Method: 1) InfoRM uses Information Bottleneck to prune reward modeling representations, reducing misgeneralization by discarding preference-irrelevant features. 2) Identify reward-hacked responses as outliers in the IB latent space via Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. 3) Propose IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes large deviations, expanding the optimization landscape while preserving alignment. 4) Prove IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. 5) Introduce Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP) as a statistical metric for measuring hacking severity to guide hyperparameters and online mitigation (e.g., early stopping). 6) Validate across diverse LLMs/datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of the approach: InfoRM and IBL improve robustness against reward hacking across models and data, and MOP provides a reliable diagnostic for tuning and early stopping, supporting more reliable RLHF.

Conclusion: The work presents a principled framework (InfoRM+IBL) to mitigate reward hacking in RLHF, backed by theory (IB-space equivalence to pessimistic RL) and a practical diagnostic (MOP), with empirical evidence across multiple models and datasets.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

### [216] [Don't Be Greedy, Just Relax! Pruning LLMs via Frank-Wolfe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13713)
*Christophe Roux,Max Zimmer,Alexandre d'Aspremont,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A convex-relaxed, Frank-Wolfe-based approach for layer-wise pruning of LLMs that optimizes binary pruning masks without full retraining, achieving lower per-layer pruning error and strong GPT performance with memory efficiency, plus rounding guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM pruning often relies on greedy, layer-wise pruning that ignores interactions between weights, and retraining to recover lost accuracy is expensive. A principled optimization that accounts for weight interactions could improve pruning quality while remaining practical for large models.

Method: Formulate pruning as a combinatorial optimization and apply a convex relaxation of the binary pruning masks. Solve the relaxed problem using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in a layer-wise fashion with a small calibration dataset. After obtaining the relaxed (continuous) solution, round it to an integral binary mask to recover a pruning configuration. The approach is backed by convergence guarantees of Frank-Wolfe, implying the rounded solution approximates the original combinatorial problem.

Result: The proposed method drastically reduces per-layer pruning error and outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, while maintaining memory efficiency.

Conclusion: Convex relaxation with Frank-Wolfe, followed by rounding, provides an effective and scalable pruning framework for LLMs, delivering near-optimal pruning masks with theoretical guarantees and practical performance gains without full retraining.

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

*Carlo Saccardi,Maximilian Pierzyna,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Simone Monaco,Cristian Meo,Pietro Liò,Rudolf Saathof,Geethu Joseph,Justin Dauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed evaluation reveals DL weather downscaling models generalize poorly across geographies and fail to preserve physical quantities; a simple power spectral density loss improves geographic generalization and small-scale structure reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of deep learning-based climate downscaling by going beyond standard ML metrics and incorporating atmospheric physics and geographic generalization.

Method: Benchmark recent state-of-the-art DL downscaling models (e.g., CorrDiff) across multiple geographies (e.g., central Europe, Iberia, Morocco, Scandinavia); assess second-order variables (divergence, vorticity) derived from predicted velocity fields; introduce and evaluate a PSD loss that encourages reconstruction of small-scale physical structures; provide code for reproducibility (GitHub: PSD-Downscaling).

Result: Despite strong reported performance, models trained on limited European geographies fail to generalize to other regions and struggle to accurately reproduce divergence and vorticity; deficiencies persist even within in-distribution geographies. The PSD loss empirically improves geographic generalization by promoting small-scale structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired diagnostics are essential for evaluating DL downscaling; a PSD loss offers a simple, effective initial step toward more physically consistent and geographically robust predictions, though further work is needed to improve physical consistency and generalization.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

### [218] [Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13748)
*Thomas van Vuren,Fiona Sloothaak,Maarten G. Wolf,Jaron Sanders*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In Block MDPs with latent structure, a two-phase RL algorithm that learns latent states via random exploration and then uses an optimism-guided policy achieves regret O(sqrt(T) + n) for a broad class of BMDPs, improving over the previous O(sqrt(T) + n^2) and is asymptotically optimal on this class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The curse of dimensionality makes RL hard in settings with large observation spaces. If the environment's dynamics depend only on latent states, then exploiting this hidden structure via clustering can substantially speed up learning. The work aims to quantify the impact of latent-state learning on regret.

Method: A two-phase algorithm: (1) random exploration to learn latent structure of observations (via clustering) to identify latent states; (2) an optimism-guided policy adapted to the uncovered latent structure (BMDP setting). The analysis targets a class of BMDPs amenable to clustering where transition dynamics are driven by latent states.

Result: The algorithm achieves regret O(sqrt(T) + n) for a broad class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering, improving the prior bound of O(sqrt(T) + n^2). It also proves a matching lower bound: no algorithm can uniformly beat this within the same class, establishing asymptotic optimality on the class.

Conclusion: Exploiting latent-state estimation through clustering can substantially speed RL in BMDPs, and the proposed two-phase approach is asymptotically optimal for problems where clustering accurately recovers latent structure.

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

### [219] [Progressive multi-fidelity learning for physical system predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13762)
*Paolo Conti,Mengwu Guo,Attilio Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A progressive, multi-fidelity surrogate framework using modality-specific encoders to integrate heterogeneous, non-concurrent data via dual connection paths (concatenation and additive) so higher-fidelity predictions are corrected additively by lower-fidelity information without degrading existing performance; validated on benchmarks and a real-world case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity data are costly and scarce; low-fidelity data are cheaper and cover more scenarios. Real-world problems often involve multiple data modalities that are not concurrently available. A framework is needed to progressively and safely fuse diverse information to improve surrogate accuracy and generalization.

Method: Introduce a progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model with tailored encoders for each data type. Encode inputs, perform multi-fidelity regression from encoded inputs to targets using neural networks. Use two connection schemes: (1) concatenation of all encoded inputs to enable cross-modal correlations; (2) additive connections among final outputs to ensure each fidelity adds a correction to the previous without altering it. Train to preserve previous performance while incorporating new data; adaptable as inputs become available.

Result: The approach reliably integrates multi-modal data and yields accurate predictions. It maintains performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations, demonstrating robustness to varying input availability and distribution shifts across fidelities.

Conclusion: Progressive, encoder-based multi-fidelity surrogates with dual connection mechanisms effectively leverage heterogeneous, non-concurrent data, avoiding performance degradation as data are added and enabling accurate, generalizable predictions across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

*Qiwei Yuan,Zhitong Xu,Yinghao Chen,Yiming Xu,Houman Owhadi,Shandian Zhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces TGPS, a tensor GP-based PDE solver that scales to large collocation sets by decomposing along dimensions into 1D GPs and combining via tensor factorization; uses ALS with closed-form updates and partial freezing with Newton's method for nonlinear terms; provides theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML solvers for PDEs are either neural network-based, which rely on stochastic training and can be inefficient, or GP/kernel-based methods, which struggle with scalability when many collocation points are needed for challenging or high-dimensional PDEs. There is a need for a scalable, principled, and accurate PDE solver.

Method: Model factor functions along each input dimension with one-dimensional Gaussian processes and couple them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution. This reduces learning to a collection of 1D GPs. For nonlinear PDEs, apply a partial freezing strategy and use Newton's method to linearize nonlinear terms, then solve via an alternating least squares (ALS) approach with closed-form updates.

Result: Experiments on benchmark PDEs show superior accuracy and efficiency compared with existing approaches, and the method scales to massive collocation sets.

Conclusion: TGPS offers a scalable, accurate GP-based PDE solver with theoretical guarantees (expressivity, convergence, and error analysis) and demonstrates strong empirical performance, making it a competitive alternative to neural and traditional GP approaches for high-dimensional or large-scale PDE problems.

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanFusion is a Geo-Foundation Model with Stochastic Multimodal Fusion that unifies diverse geospatial data (street view, remote sensing, maps, POIs) via a Transformer fusion module, achieving strong cross-task and cross-city generalization and enabling multimodal inputs at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GeoAI approaches are mostly task-specific and existing spatial foundation models support limited modalities with poor multimodal fusion; there is a need for a flexible, scalable model that can ingest and fuse multiple geospatial modalities for diverse urban prediction tasks and unseen regions.

Method: Use modality-specific encoders for street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and POIs, followed by a Transformer-based stochastic multimodal fusion (SMF) module to learn unified representations. The model supports choosing any subset of modalities during pretraining and inference and is evaluated across 41 tasks in 56 cities.

Result: UrbanFusion achieves strong generalization and predictive performance, outperforming prior GeoAI/foundation models on location encoding, enables multimodal input during inference, and generalizes to regions unseen during training.

Conclusion: UrbanFusion offers flexible multimodal fusion and broad applicability across varying data availability, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

<details>

Motivation: Temporal graph classification lags behind other temporal tasks due to loss of fine-grained temporal cues and long-range dependencies. Snapshot-based and recurrent methods can discard information and oversmooth/oversquash local message passing; a flexible, robust approach is needed for cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization.

Method: Proposes T3former, which treats sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens and integrates them through Descriptor-Attention. This preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, enables principled cross-modal fusion without fixed discretization, and provides theoretical stability guarantees under temporal and structural perturbations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks (dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity, and traffic networks) and offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the power of combining topological and spectral insights for temporal graph learning, with broad applicability and robustness improvements over existing snapshot/recurrent approaches.

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

### [223] [From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864)
*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RID is a low-compute meta-prompting framework that improves human-aligned, intent-driven reasoning in LLMs, outperforming supervised fine-tuning and Chain-of-Thought prompts on a 20-scenario benchmark, achieving 95% Human Alignment Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule rigidity in LLMs leads to decisions that misalign with human common sense and intent, and while SFT with explanations helps, it is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. A low-cost alternative is needed to steer LLMs toward human-aligned, flexible reasoning.

Method: RID provides a structured cognitive schema within a meta-prompt to deconstruct tasks, classify rules, weigh conflicting outcomes, and justify decisions in a zero-shot manner. It is evaluated against baselines and Chain-of-Thought prompting on a 20-scenario benchmark with human-verified results.

Result: RID achieves a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), outperforming Baseline (80%) and Chain-of-Thought (75%). It also produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.

Conclusion: RID offers a practical, accessible, and effective approach to shift LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, enabling more reliable and pragmatic autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

### [224] [DeepPlanner: Scaling Planning Capability for Deep Research Agents via Advantage Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12979)
*Wei Fan,Wenlin Yao,Zheng Li,Feng Yao,Xin Liu,Liang Qiu,Qingyu Yin,Yangqiu Song,Bing Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPlanner is an end-to-end RL framework that enhances planning in LLM-based agents by entropy-guided, token-level updates, achieving state-of-the-art planning quality with a substantially lower training budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning remains under-optimized in LLM agents that perform multi-step reasoning with external tools. Vanilla RL shows high entropy in planning tokens, indicating uncertain decision points and room for improvement. A systematic optimization of the planning stage is needed.

Method: Introduce DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework. It shapes token-level advantages with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high-entropy planning tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts.

Result: Across seven deep-research benchmarks, DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results while using a substantially lower training budget.

Conclusion: DeepPlanner effectively enhances planning capabilities in deep research agents and enables more efficient, higher-quality planning with less training cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

### [225] [SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of LLM-based Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12985)
*Simon Sinong Zhan,Yao Liu,Philip Wang,Zinan Wang,Qineng Wang,Zhian Ruan,Xiangyu Shi,Xinyu Cao,Frank Yang,Kangrui Wang,Huajie Shao,Manling Li,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sentinel is a formal, multi-level framework for evaluating the physical safety of LLM-based embodied agents using temporal logic (semantic, plan, trajectory levels), enabling precise safety verification and exposing violations overlooked by prior heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations rely on heuristic rules or subjective judgments; there is a need for formal, verifiable safety guarantees that can handle state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints across planning and execution.

Method: Formally encode safety requirements as temporal-logic formulas. At the semantic level, assess alignment between the agent's understanding and TL specs; at the plan level, verify high-level plans against TL specs to preempt unsafe plans; at the trajectory level, merge execution trajectories into a computation tree and verify against TL specs for a final safety check. Apply to VirtualHome and ALFRED and evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements.

Result: Demonstrates that grounding physical safety in TL and applying verification across semantic, plan, and trajectory levels reveals safety violations missed by prior methods and provides a rigorous basis for analyzing failure modes in embodied agents.

Conclusion: Sentinel provides a rigorous, multi-level, formally-grounded framework for evaluating the physical safety of LLM-based embodied agents, enabling systematic exposure of safety violations and offering insights into their failure modes across real environments.

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

### [226] [From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13002)
*Boyou Chen,Gerui Xu,Zifei Wang,Huizhong Guo,Ananna Ahmed,Zhaonan Sun,Zhen Hu,Kaihan Zhang,Shan Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tunes Llama 3.2 1B on crash narratives to automatically infer Driver Hazardous Actions (DHA) with 80% accuracy, outperforming baseline models; uses probabilistic reasoning over counterfactuals for interpretability; scalable, large-scale DHA detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DHA data in large crash databases suffer from inconsistent, labor-intensive manual coding. An automated, scalable, interpretable approach is needed to improve DHA classification validity and utility for traffic safety analysis.

Method: Fine-tune Llama 3.2 1B on five years of two-vehicle crash narratives from MTCF. Benchmark against Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. Develop probabilistic reasoning by analyzing output shifts across test sets and three counterfactual scenarios (varying driver distraction and age) to enhance interpretability.

Result: Achieves ~80% overall accuracy, outperforming all baselines and particularly improving performance on imbalanced data. Counterfactual analysis reveals that driver distraction increases 'General Unsafe Driving' probability; distraction of both drivers elevates 'Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions'; teen driver elevates 'Speed and Stopping Violations.'

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, enabling improved traffic safety analysis and targeted interventions.

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

### [227] [Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13029)
*Xinlei Wang,Mingtian Tan,Jing Qiu,Junhua Zhao,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs could reframes time series analysis as a causal, explainable reasoning task by integrating multimodal inputs; critiques current regression-centric usage and emphasizes human-aligned understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series are influenced by shifting policies, adaptive human behavior, and unforeseen events. This requires going beyond surface-level trends. LLMs offer reasoning and explanatory power that can make analyses more transparent and context-aware, addressing the need for causal structure and explainability in time series.

Method: Propose rethinking time series as a reasoning task for LLMs, focusing on causal structure and explainability; integrate multimodal inputs; critically assess existing LLM-based methods that rely on numerical regression and overlook deeper reasoning; outline a framework rather than presenting a concrete algorithm.

Result: Conceptual argument and synthesis without presenting empirical results; lays out a theoretical shift toward reasoning and explainability rather than direct predictive performance.

Conclusion: Advocates moving time series analysis toward human-aligned understanding with transparent, context-aware insights in complex real-world environments by leveraging LLMs for causal reasoning and explainability.

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

### [228] [Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13036)
*Stephane Hatgis-Kessell,Logan Mondal Bhamidipaty,Emma Brunskill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR) automatically repairs a human-provided proxy reward by learning a limited, additive, transition-dependent correction from human preferences, reducing the need for large preference datasets while improving alignment with the true objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-designed reward functions often misalign with true objectives, leading to reward hacking. While RL from human feedback can fix this, collecting preferences is costly. There's a need for a method that tightens existing proxies with minimal additional data.

Method: Iteratively learn an additive, transition-dependent correction term to a proxy reward using a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. The framework repairs the proxy reward based on preferences over trajectories, and is designed to require only a small number of preference queries to achieve near-optimal performance in the true objective.

Result: In tabular domains, PBRR achieves a cumulative regret comparable to prior preference-based RL methods (up to constants). On reward-hacking benchmarks, it outperforms baselines that learn rewards from scratch or modify proxies via other methods, while using substantially fewer preferences.

Conclusion: PBRR effectively repairs misaligned proxy rewards with fewer human preferences and strong empirical and theoretical support, offering a practical path to aligning RL policies with true objectives without designing exhaustive new reward functions.

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

### [229] [Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13195)
*Qun Ma,Xiao Xue,Xuwen Zhang,Zihan Zhao,Yuwei Guo,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Emotional cognition framework for LLM-based agents to align with human emotions, integrating desire generation and objective management to model full decision-making and improve ecological validity in social simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address severe limitations in affective cognition (bounded rationality and lack of empirically validated emotion integration) to enable more realistic virtual-human agents in societal simulations.

Method: Proposed emotional cognition framework; models state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution; implements in a proprietary multi-agent environment; evaluates against other agent types.

Result: Agents governed by the framework display emotion-consistent behaviors, show greater ecological validity, and produce decision outcomes that more closely resemble human behavior than alternatives.

Conclusion: Emotion-aligned LLM-based agents can better bridge virtual and real-world social systems; the framework provides a viable path for integrating emotions into agent decision architectures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Yichi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Xigui Li,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage LLM framework where a small model proposes an answer, which a larger model verifies; if the initial answer is wrong, the larger model performs in-depth reasoning. This approach reduces large-model usage and costs while preserving accuracy on simple tasks and robustness on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost of applying deep reasoning/chain-of-thought prompting across problems by avoiding full-scale reasoning for straightforward cases.

Method: Small LLM generates an initial answer; Large LLM verifies; if correct, adopt; if incorrect, Large LLM conducts in-depth reasoning to produce the final answer.

Result: Experiments show more than 50% reduction in large-Large LLM computational cost for simple problems with negligible accuracy loss, while maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Conclusion: A complementary agent system that combines small and large LLMs can balance efficiency and accuracy, enabling scalable reasoning across problem difficulties.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

### [231] [Personalized Learning Path Planning with Goal-Driven Learner State Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13215)
*Joy Jia Yin Lim,Ye He,Jifan Yu,Xin Cong,Daniel Zhang-Li,Zhiyuan Liu,Huiqin Liu,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li,Bin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pxplore is a reinforcement-based PLPP framework that leverages LLM-driven educational architecture to produce goal-aligned, personalized learning paths, using a structured learner state model and an automated reward signal, trained via SFT and GRPO and deployed in a real-world platform with released code and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in PLPP where large language models can personalize content but struggle with explicit goal-alignment in planning; existing methods lack a robust mechanism to translate high-level goals into computable, sequential learning steps.

Method: Propose Pxplore: (1) a modular LLM-based education architecture; (2) a structured learner state model representing goals, constraints, and progress; (3) an automated reward function that maps abstract objectives to computable signals; (4) policy training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO); (5) deployment in a real-world learning platform; (6) release of code and dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show Pxplore generates coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths, outperforming baselines and validating the approach in a practical platform.

Conclusion: Pxplore cohesively integrates goal-aware planning with LLM-driven pedagogy and reinforcement learning, addressing a key limitation in current PLPP research and enabling scalable, real-world deployment; the released code and data support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning
paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show
potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack
mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework
for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

### [232] [EvoTest: Evolutionary Test-Time Learning for Self-Improving Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13220)
*Yufei He,Juncheng Liu,Yue Liu,Yibo Li,Tri Cao,Zhiyuan Hu,Xinxing Xu,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new test-time learning benchmark (J-TTL) measures an agent's ability to improve over consecutive episodes, and EvoTest—a gradient-free, evolutionary framework—consistently improves performance by reconfiguring the agent after each episode; it outperforms reflection, memory-only methods, and online fine-tuning, even winning two games where baselines fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents struggle to learn complex skills on the fly at test time, limiting practical utility. There is a need for a standardized benchmark to measure test-time adaptability and progress, and for methods that improve agents without offline fine-tuning or gradients.

Method: Introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark where an agent plays the same game for several episodes to improve across runs. Propose EvoTest, an evolutionary framework with an Actor Agent (plays the game) and an Evolver Agent (analyzes the episode transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run). The Evolver rewrites prompts, updates memory with effective state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns tool-use routines, all without fine-tuning or gradients. The entire agentic system is evolved after each episode.

Result: On J-TTL, EvoTest consistently improves performance and outperforms reflection and memory-only baselines as well as online fine-tuning methods. It uniquely wins two games (Detective and Library), whereas all baselines fail to win any.

Conclusion: EvoTest provides a viable, gradient-free pathway to address test-time learning challenges and sets a benchmark for measuring and driving progress in adaptable AI agents; the framework demonstrates that evolving the whole agentic system after each episode can yield robust improvements.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

### [233] [An Analytical Framework to Enhance Autonomous Vehicle Perception for Smart Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13230)
*Jalal Khan,Manzoor Khan,Sherzod Turaev,Sumbal Malik,Hesham El-Sayed,Farman Ullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A utility-based evaluation framework for autonomous-vehicle perception is proposed, integrating a custom dataset (including motorcycles, rickshaws, etc.), a YOLOv8s detector, and a utility module to assess perception performance. It benchmarks against nuScenes, showing AdamW-based YOLOv8s offers strong class-level metrics and overall utility, enabling selection of suitable perception for AVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous vehicle perception by developing DL-based models that accurately detect multiple road objects and align perception quality with vehicle control requirements, thereby supporting smart mobility.

Method: 1) Create a custom dataset with distinctive road objects; 2) Apply YOLOv8s for object detection; 3) Implement a utility-measurement module that translates model performance into perception utility; 4) Benchmark against state-of-the-art models using nuScenes metrics and class-level results.

Result: Three top YOLOv8s instances by mAP@0.5: SGD-based 0.832, Adam-based 0.810, AdamW-based 0.822. Class-level: AdamW (car 0.921, motorcyclist 0.899, truck 0.793, etc.) surpasses SGD (car 0.915, motorcyclist 0.892, truck 0.781, etc.). The proposed utility function validates the right perception choices for AVs and supports evaluating learning models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a utility-based perception model can evaluate and select appropriate perception for autonomous vehicles, encouraging its use to quantify and compare learning-model utilities for AV perception.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

### [234] [SAJA: A State-Action Joint Attack Framework on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13262)
*Weiqi Guo,Guanjun Liu,Ziyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAJA is a joint state-action adversarial attack for MADRL that uses a two-phase gradient ascent to craft adversarial state and action, guided by actor and critic networks, with a critic-informed regularizer; it outperforms state-only and action-only attacks in MPE and defeats existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MADRL models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing attacks focus on either state or action perturbations, missing potential synergy. A joint attack could be more effective and stealthy.

Method: Phase 1 (state attack): multi-step gradient ascent using both the actor and critic to craft adversarial states. Phase 2 (action attack): conditioned on the perturbed state, another gradient ascent using the critic to craft the final adversarial actions. A heuristic regularizer penalizes large deviations between perturbed and original actions to sharpen the critic-guided attack.

Result: In Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), SAJA outperforms state-only and action-only attacks and is more stealthy. Existing defenses targeting only state or only action perturbations fail to defend against SAJA.

Conclusion: Joint state-action perturbations reveal deeper vulnerabilities in MADRL. Defenses should address the joint attack space, and future work should test generalizability, robustness against adaptive/white-box defenses, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

### [235] [Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric Self-explanation Rationalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13393)
*Yunxiao Zhao,Zhiqiang Wang,Xingtong Yu,Xiaoli Li,Jiye Liang,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PORAT uses game-theoretic policy optimization to address mode collapse in cooperative rationalization, achieving notable gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rationalization seeks interpretable explanations by selecting informative input fragments, but existing methods suffer from mode collapse: the predictor is correct while the generator outputs collapsed rationales; current approaches lack a unified treatment.

Method: Propose PORAT (Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization), a game-theoretic framework that progressively injects policy interventions to steer the cooperative game towards better equilibria; includes theoretical analysis of the suboptimal equilibrium and empirical validation.

Result: Empirically shows improvements up to 8.1% over state-of-the-art methods across nine real-world datasets and two synthetic settings.

Conclusion: PORAT is feasible and effective for cooperative rationalization, with theoretical justification and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [236] [Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13417)
*Liesbeth Allein,Nataly Pineda-Castañeda,Andrea Rocci,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models perform implicit causal chain discovery to explain how causes lead to effects. It finds variability across models in the number and granularity of intermediate steps, but models mainly rely on associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning; human evaluators find the produced chains logically coherent. A baseline approach and a benchmark dataset for implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation are proposed to guide future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs in explaining causal links through intermediate steps, particularly in polarized climate-change debates, and to establish a baseline methodology and dataset for implicit reasoning in argumentation.

Method: A diagnostic evaluation framework where nine LLMs are instructed to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause–effect pairs within causal chain structures. The cause–effect pairs are drawn from climate-change argumentation resources. The study analyzes the quantity and granularity of steps, assesses self-consistency and confidence, and includes human evaluations of coherence.

Result: LLMs vary in the number and granularity of intermediate steps produced. They are generally self-consistent and confident about their intermediate connections, but their judgments appear driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Human evaluations confirm the logical coherence and integrity of the chains. The work also provides a baseline causal chain discovery approach and a benchmark dataset to support future work.

Conclusion: The study offers a solid foundation for advancing implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings by sharing a baseline approach, diagnostic insights, and a benchmark dataset, enabling more rigorous evaluation and development of LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

*Timothy Wong,Tom Freeman,Joseph Feehily*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Crowdsourced QoE-driven framework using OC-SVM to map cell-level coverage and identify urban weak spots, aggregating to site level with geolocation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately map mobile coverage and pinpoint localized weak spots to improve user QoE, especially in dense urban environments, using crowdsourced data.

Method: Apply One-Class SVM to learn coverage contour per cell; compute coverage area from decision boundary; aggregate to site level; analyze crowdsourced service loss reports to locate weak spots; utilize empirical geolocation data.

Result: Demonstrates effective coverage mapping and detection of granular signal deficiencies; robust in complex urban scenarios.

Conclusion: OC-SVM-based coverage analysis with crowdsourced data is a promising approach for precise coverage mapping and weak-spot localization.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

### [238] [Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13501)
*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew): a training-free reward signaling method that uses token-level confidence in a model's final answers to assess quality, achieving strong results on math benchmarks and enabling data filtering; extended with CRew-DPO to derive preference data and further improve judging via finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models for LLMs are costly and data-hungry. Training-free approaches using intrinsic model signals (e.g., judge-style evaluation, confidence) offer scalable alternatives. There is a need to systematically study confidence as a reward and its applicability to close-ended tasks.

Method: Use token-level confidence of the model's final answer as a proxy reward for evaluating responses, particularly for close-ended tasks. Evaluate on MATH500 and RewardMATH to establish performance. Observe correlations between CRew and actual reasoning ability. Use CRew scores to filter high-quality training data. Propose CRew-DPO, which constructs preference data from confidence signals plus correctness, and finetune to enhance judging capability.

Result: CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on MATH500 and RewardMATH and surpasses most trained reward models. A strong correlation is observed between CRew scores and actual reasoning performance. CRew effectively filters high-quality data. CRew-DPO further improves judging ability and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-based, training-free rewards are effective for judging and improving LLM reasoning, with practical benefits in data selection and model alignment. The CRew-DPO strategy offers a scalable path to further improvements in training-free or low-supervision settings.

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to assess risks in metric selection and SME evaluation for GenAI workloads in finance, addressing generalization gaps of traditional ML metrics and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI adoption in financial services is hindered by measurement challenges: historical ML metrics often fail to generalize to GenAI workloads; SME evaluations are used but can miss unique risks; widely used benchmarks from academia/industry may not generalize to industrial settings; a risk-based framework is needed to guide evaluation.

Method: Introduce a Risk Assessment Framework that guides the application of machine learning metrics and SME evaluations to GenAI workloads in financial services, outlining components or steps for identifying metrics, assessing associated risks, and aligning evaluation with GenAI-specific risk considerations.

Result: The paper presents a Risk Assessment Framework intended to improve the application of SME and ML metrics for GenAI performance evaluation in financial services (no empirical results are described in the abstract).

Conclusion: The framework addresses key measurement challenges in GenAI adoption within finance by systematically considering metric-related risks and SME input, enabling more reliable and appropriate model performance assessment.

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

### [240] [Tandem Training for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13551)
*Robert West,Ashton Anderson,Ece Kamar,Eric Horvitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tandem training is a new RL-based approach where a strong language model learns with rollout tokens intermittently drawn from a frozen weak model, aiming to keep solutions intelligible to weaker partners without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrated on GSM8K math reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LMs rapidly improve, their reasoning can become opaque to weaker agents and humans, hindering interpretation and oversight. The work seeks to ensure outputs remain intelligible to weaker collaborators, enabling auditable AI and safer human–AI collaboration in the long term.

Method: Introduce tandem training: during RL, rollout tokens are intermittently sampled from a frozen weak model instead of the strong model. Success requires that the strong model's reasoning can be continued by the weak model, tying optimization to both correctness and intelligibility (handoff robustness).

Result: On GSM8K math reasoning, tandem training makes models abandon jargon and tailor language to weaker partners while preserving task accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising path toward auditable AI systems that weaker agents can follow, with implications for human–AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

### [241] [A Modal Logic for Temporal and Jurisdictional Classifier Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13691)
*Cecilia Di Florio,Huimin Dong,Antonino Rotolo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal modal-logic framework for classifier verification in law, modeling legal case-based reasoning with temporal case ordering and court hierarchy to resolve precedents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal ML needs trustworthy, explainable reasoning and coherent conflict resolution among precedents; existing ML often treats cases as flat data, missing legal structure.

Method: Develop a modal logic of classifiers; extend with temporal dimensions to capture the evolution of cases; encode hierarchy of courts to reflect authority; aim to support verification tools.

Result: Proposal of a formal logic; mechanism to capture CBR and precedence resolution; no empirical evaluation reported in the abstract; sets groundwork for verification tools.

Conclusion: The logic provides a formal foundation to model legal CBR and resolve conflicts via time and hierarchy; could enable more principled verification of ML classifiers in legal settings.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

### [242] [Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13709)
*Evan Ellis,Vivek Myers,Jens Tuyls,Sergey Levine,Anca Dragan,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empower: a self-supervised, offline-data fine-tuning objective that maximizes human empowerment, enabling language models to better assist humans without explicit rewards; shows strong user preference and large gains in simulated code-writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assistive agents often override user decisions or rely on costly human feedback to shape behavior. There is a need for scalable, offline-data–driven methods that align agents with empowering humans and allowing them to effect desired changes in the environment.

Method: Introduce an empowerment-maximizing objective (Empower) for fine-tuning language models using only offline text data (self-supervised). Evaluate via an 18-person user study against a strong baseline, and develop a new multi-turn code-assistance environment with simulated humans to test effects on coding task success.

Result: Users preferred Empower 78% of the time (p=0.015); 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions compared to baseline. In the code-assistance environment, Empower-trained agents increased simulated human programmer success on challenging coding questions by 192% over an SFT baseline.

Conclusion: Empower enables useful, aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data, avoiding extra human feedback or verifiable rewards, and provides a framework for empowering human users across tasks.

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

### [243] [From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13727)
*Ravi Pandya,Madison Bland,Duy P. Nguyen,Changliu Liu,Jaime Fernández Fisac,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes safety-critical, control-theoretic guardrails for generative AI that actively monitor and correct outputs in real time, in a model-agnostic way, to prevent catastrophic outcomes while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guardrails rely on static output classification and human-defined criteria, which fail in novel or evolving hazardous situations; safety is a sequential, control problem where downstream consequences matter.

Method: Frame guardrails as safety-critical control in the AI's latent world model; real-time monitoring of outputs (actions) and proactive correction to safe ones; model-agnostic wrapper; train using safety-critical reinforcement learning at scale.

Result: In simulated driving and e-commerce tasks, the guardrails reliably steer agents away from catastrophes (e.g., collisions, bankruptcy) while maintaining task performance, offering a dynamic alternative to blocking-only safeguards.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, scalable dynamic safety mechanism for generative AI that can be wrapped around various models, bridging planning and control to preempt harm rather than merely classify it.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

*Shrey Pandit,Austin Xu,Xuan-Phi Nguyen,Yifei Ming,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hard2Verify is a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark for LLM math reasoning, enabling rigorous evaluation of step-level verifiers on frontier models; findings show current open-source verifiers underperform closed-source ones; analysis covers scaling compute, self-verification, and verification-generation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable, step-level verification to ensure each reasoning step in LLM-based math solutions is correct and sufficiently supported, especially for challenging, open-ended problems like IMO-style questions.

Method: Create Hard2Verify with over 500 hours of human labor; verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses from frontier LLMs on recent, difficult math questions; evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models.

Result: Most verifiers perform poorly except for a few standout models; open-source verifiers lag behind closed-source ones; analysis identifies drivers of poor verification performance and the impact of scaling verifier compute; explores self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

Conclusion: Hard2Verify provides a rigorous benchmark and actionable insights to improve step-level verification in LLM reasoning, highlighting gaps between open-source and closed-source verifiers and guiding future research in verifier design and training.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
