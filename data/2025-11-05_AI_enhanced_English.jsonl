As the\nfoundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to\nsupport new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the\nmodels towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation\nmodels for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose\nmodels like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoCrossBench expands GeoBench with evaluation for cross-satellite generalization (in-distribution, no-band overlap, and extra-band settings) and introduces ChiViT, a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT.

Develop ChiViT, a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, to improve cross-satellite generalization. Compare state-of-the-art foundation models (DOFA, TerraFM) and general-purpose models (DINOv3) under ID and cross-satellite shifts. Analyze impact of adding unseen bands and evaluate this with oracle-label fine-tuning of the last linear layer to gauge upper-bound performance.", "result": "Findings show: (1) DOFA and TerraFM do not outperform DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting; (2) with no band overlap, all models drop 2\u20134x, though ChiViT outperforms the runner-up DINOv3; (3) adding extra bands at test time causes an average 5\u201325% performance drop across models; (4) fine-tuning only the last linear layer with oracle multi-band labels yields relatively stable performance across satellites, indicating the benchmark is not saturated.", "conclusion": "Cross-satellite generalization remains challenging, even for strong foundation models. The GeoCrossBench protocol reveals gaps that can be mitigated by self-supervised cross-satellite pretraining (as in ChiViT) and suggests that simple linear-head fine-tuning on multi-band labels can achieve more consistent cross-satellite performance. Public release of code and datasets should accelerate the development of robust cross-satellite Earth-observation models."}}
