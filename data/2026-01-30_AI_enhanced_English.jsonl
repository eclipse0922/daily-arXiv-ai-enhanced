We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks.

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency.

Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights.

Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control.

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers.

Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters.

On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision.

These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data.

Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router.

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks.

Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits.

Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization.

In multitask learning problem, we are given a set of heterogeneous datasets collected from related source tasks and hope to enhance the performance above what we could hope to achieve by solving each of them individually. The recent work of arXiv:2006.15785 has showed that, without access to distributional information, no algorithm based on aggregating samples alone can guarantee optimal risk as long as the sample size per task is bounded.\n  In this paper, we focus on understanding the statistical limits of multitask learning. We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task. This improvement conveys an important message that the hardness of multitask learning cannot be overcame by having abundant data per task. We also discuss the notion of optimal adaptivity that may be of future interests.", "AI": {"tldr": "A stronger impossibility result for adaptation in multitask learning that persists even with arbitrarily large per-task sample sizes, extending previous no-free-lunch findings.", "motivation": "To understand the fundamental statistical limits of multitask learning and explain why additional data per task may not surmount distributional uncertainty; to motivate the study of optimal adaptivity.", "method": "Theoretical analysis establishing lower bounds/impossibility for adaptation in multitask learning; extends prior results (no-free-lunch) to the regime of unlimited per-task data; likely uses information-theoretic or worst-case distribution arguments.", "result": "Proves a stronger adaptation impossibility that holds irrespective of per-task sample size; shows hardness remains unsolved by data abundance; clarifies the role of data in multitask learning.", "conclusion": "Introduces the notion of optimal adaptivity as a potential future direction to characterize achievable performance under multitask learning constraints; highlights intrinsic limits of transfer across tasks."}}

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\u03b5$ is close to optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "First analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees in active learning.
