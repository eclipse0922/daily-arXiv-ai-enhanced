### [1] [Randomized-MLP Regularization Improves Domain Adaptation and Interpretability in DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05509)
*Joel Valdivia Ortega,Lorenz Lamm,Franziska Eckardt,Benedikt Schworm,Marion Jasnin,Tingying Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization for ViTs (e.g., DINOv2) that, via contrastive learning on randomized MLP tokens, yields more semantically aligned representations and more interpretable attention without sacrificing downstream performance across medical and natural images; supported by a mathematical analysis of RMLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs often repurpose low-informative patch tokens, reducing attention and feature-map interpretability. This is aggravated by domain shifts in medical imaging. There is a need for regularization techniques that improve semantic alignment and transparency without harming accuracy.

Method: Propose Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive-learning-based approach. Integrate RMLPs during fine-tuning of DINOv2 on both medical and natural image modalities to encourage semantically aligned representations. Provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs to elucidate its effect on ViT representations and the role of contrastive learning.

Result: Demonstrates improved or unchanged downstream performance while yielding more interpretable attention maps across modalities. The study also contributes a mathematical analysis that offers theoretical insight into how RMLPs enhance ViT-based models and advances understanding of contrastive learning.

Conclusion: RMLP regularization can enhance ViT interpretability and robustness to domain shifts without sacrificing accuracy. The work deepens theoretical understanding of contrastive learning in vision transformers and suggests practical benefits for medical imaging and cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv2, achieve strong performance across domains but often repurpose low-informative patch tokens in ways that reduce the interpretability of attention and feature maps. This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.

### [2] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Sparse Intent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token-based, minimal semantic representation suffices for planning in end-to-end autonomous driving, achieving competitive ADE without full future scene generation; conditioning on predicted future tokens improves performance; explicit reconstruction loss may harm; temporal fuzziness suggests planning via flexible semantics rather than fixed timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the necessity of exhaustive world modeling and Markov-based vision-language-action systems for high-performance E2E driving; propose a cognitively inspired approach where planning occurs through imagination over a sparse token set.

Method: Evaluate on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, >11k samples) using perception-informed BEV representations. Compare (1) baseline sparse token representation without future prediction, (2) token-conditioned trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens, and (3) inclusion of explicit reconstruction loss. Assess performance via ADE and analyze emergent temporal fuzziness where the model attends to task-relevant semantics rather than fixed timestamps.

Result: Baseline ADE: 0.548 m; with predicted future tokens: 0.479 m (≈12.6% improvement over baselines). Reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance given reliable perception. Notable emergence of temporal fuzziness: model attends to semantics rather than rigid timestamps, enabling planning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Supports a paradigm shift from world reconstruction to semantic understanding through tokens. The ‘token is all you need’ principle suggests planning via imagination is feasible and potentially advantageous for cognitively inspired E2E systems, with implications for robustness and scalability.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

### [3] [Automated Invoice Data Extraction: Using LLM and OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05547)
*Advait Thakur,Khushi Khanchandani,Akshita Shetty,Chaitravi Reddy,Ritisa Behera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A holistic AI platform that integrates OCR, deep learning (CNNs/Transformers), LLMs, and graph analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency in invoice data extraction across diverse layouts and low-quality scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invoices exhibit highly variable layouts, handwriting, and poor scan quality, and template-based OCR struggles to generalize. There is a need for scalable, accurate, low-maintenance extraction by combining modern DL, LLMs, and contextual graph-based methods.

Method: Hybrid architecture that blends OCR with CNN/Transformer-based layout analysis, visual NER, and LLM-driven extraction, augmented by graph analytics to map relationships and ensure consistency across document sections. The approach emphasizes a unified AI platform for end-to-end extraction.

Result: The authors claim unprecedented extraction quality and consistency across invoice types, driven by the integrated platform and advanced entity recognition.

Conclusion: A unified AI platform integrating OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics can significantly improve invoice data extraction accuracy and scalability while reducing human intervention.

Abstract: Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by
variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are
often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility
across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize
advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as
well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and
accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with
sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex
contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification.
Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from
invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy
rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid
architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and
minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph
analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

### [4] [EVLP:Learning Unified Embodied Vision-Language Planner with Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05553)
*Xinyan Cai,Shiguang Wu,Dafeng Chi,Yuzheng Zhuang,Xingyue Quan,Jianye Hao,Qiang Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVLP introduces a unified multimodal generation framework for embodied long-horizon tasks, combining language-based reasoning with visual generation via dynamic perception pretraining and reinforced fine-tuning to align spatial logic with generated imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal planning methods lack a unified generation framework, leading to inconsistencies between linguistic reasoning and visual planning in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposes Unified Multimodal Generation Framework that learns the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis with cross-modal attention; Dynamic Perception Pretraining using bidirectional alignment through inverse and forward dynamics tasks; Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning with a reinforce loss to align spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, fostering spatio-aware multimodal planning.

Result: Demonstrates multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks via a novel training pipeline, achieving improved coordination between textual and visual modalities and stronger intra-model multimodal correlations through the dynamic pretraining and reinforced fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EVLP provides a cohesive framework that fuses semantic and spatial perception to enable joint language-vision planning for embodied tasks, driven by dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment to achieve robust multimodal planning.

Abstract: In complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks, effective task
decomposition and execution require synergistic integration of textual logical
reasoning and visual-spatial imagination to ensure efficient and accurate
operation. Current methods fail to adopt a unified generation framework for
multimodal planning, lead to inconsistent in multimodal planning. To address
this challenge, we present \textbf{EVLP (Embodied Vision-Language Planner)}, an
innovative multimodal unified generation framework that jointly models
linguistic reasoning and visual generation. Our approach achieves multimodal
planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating
dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of
three key components: \textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For
understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to
provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the
joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling
coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention
mechanisms. \textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a
bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and
forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations
within a unified feature space. \textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}:
While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space,
we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual
actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared
multimodal planning capabilities.

### [5] [MCFCN: Multi-View Clustering via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05554)
*Chenping Pei,Fadi Dornaika,Jingjun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFCN introduces a fusion-consensus graph convolutional network for multi-view clustering that learns a unified consensus graph and representations end-to-end, using SMAL and FRAL losses, achieving state-of-the-art on eight datasets with available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods focus on consensus representation learning via subspace methods and even graph-based MVC suffers from noisy input graphs and insufficient cross-view consistency. Multi-view graph refinement methods fail to handle hard-to-distinguish samples and often rely on disjoint graph construction steps, hindering joint optimization.

Method: Propose MCFCN with end-to-end learning of a consensus graph guided by a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA), a view feature fusion model, and two alignment losses: Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). The framework optimizes view-specific graphs under consensus guidance to preserve cross-view topology, promote intra-class edges, and learn robust consensus representations via Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN).

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art clustering performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets; extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide code at the project repository.

Conclusion: By learning a unified consensus graph and aligning both similarity structures and feature representations across views, MCFCN achieves robust consensus representations and improved clustering, addressing topological noise, cross-view inconsistency, and hard samples in MVC.

Abstract: Existing Multi-view Clustering (MVC) methods based on subspace learning focus on consensus representation learning while neglecting the inherent topological structure of data. Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations. The code will be provided at https://github.com/texttao/MCFCN.

### [6] [Compressing Multi-Task Model for Autonomous Driving via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05557)
*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang,Katsuya Suto,Lei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task panoptic perception model is compressed via safe pruning and feature distillation, achieving substantial parameter reduction with minimal performance loss and real-time speed on BDD100K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying multi-task panoptic perception on on-board devices is challenging due to growing model size; there is a need to reduce parameters while preserving segmentation and detection performance.

Method: Introduce a multi-task model compression framework: task-aware safe pruning that combines Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to prune channels, plus a task head-agnostic knowledge distillation transferring intermediate backbone/encoder features from teacher to student.

Result: On BDD100K: 32.7% parameter reduction; segmentation performance with negligible accuracy loss; detection declines of -1.2% recall and -1.8% mAP50; runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time.

Conclusion: Pruning plus knowledge distillation effectively compresses multi-task panoptic perception with preserved performance and real-time inference, offering a practical solution for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic perception to jointly handle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.

### [7] [FilletRec: A Lightweight Graph Neural Network with Intrinsic Features for Automated Fillet Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05561)
*Jiali Gao,Taoran Liu,Hongfei Ye,Jianjun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven, end-to-end framework named FilletRec for automatic recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models, featuring a lightweight graph neural network that uses pose-invariant geometric features (e.g., curvature) and a large-scale fillet dataset to improve accuracy and generalization while being highly parameter-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based methods lack robustness and deep learning models struggle with generalization and accuracy on complex fillets due to generic designs and limited training data. There is a need for a specialized, robust approach and a large, diverse dataset to support learning.

Method: Introduce FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network that leverages pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features (such as curvature) to capture fundamental geometric patterns of fillets. The approach includes constructing and releasing a large-scale diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition and integrates an efficient geometric simplification algorithm to complete the automated workflow from recognition to simplification.

Result: FilletRec achieves higher accuracy and better generalization than state-of-the-art methods while using only 0.2% to 5.4% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high efficiency. It surpasses competitors on complex fillet topology recognition and enables end-to-end automated simplification.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework advances fillet feature recognition and simplification in CAD models by combining a data-driven, geometry-aware neural model with a large-scale dataset, achieving robust performance and substantial model efficiency.

Abstract: Automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models is critical for CAE analysis, yet it remains an open challenge. Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\%-5.4\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.

*Yang Liu,Boan Chen,Xiaoguang Zhu,Jing Liu,Peng Sun,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces M2S2L, a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning framework for video anomaly detection that combines hierarchical spatial encoders, multi-temporal motion encoders, and a feature decomposition mechanism to optimize appearance and motion reconstruction; achieves strong accuracy with real-time efficiency on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection requires robust spatial-temporal modeling while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time surveillance; existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency across diverse contexts.

Method: M2S2L uses hierarchical spatial encoders at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders to capture motion dynamics across different time scales, coupled with a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, yielding better behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment.

Result: On UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets, the method achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUC, respectively, with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference, indicating strong performance with practical efficiency.

Conclusion: M2S2L provides robust, scalable spatial-temporal modeling for video anomaly detection with real-time capable performance, suitable for deployment in practical surveillance systems.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing
community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental
challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As
video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and
contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust
assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack
comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational
resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based
multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The
proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple
granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across
different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to
enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction,
facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly
assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L
framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK
Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G
FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance
deployment.

### [9] [In-Context Adaptation of VLMs for Few-Shot Cell Detection in Optical Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05565)
*Shreyan Ganguly,Angona Biswas,Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Nabila Masud,Nitish Singla,Abhipsa Dash,Ushashi Bhattacharjee,Aditya Balu,Anwesha Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Soumik Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-vocabulary few-shot object detection for biomedical microscopy using in-context learning; introduces Micro-OD benchmark (252 images, 11 cell types) and a hybrid FSOD pipeline; zero-shot is weak, few-shot helps with diminishing gains after ~6 shots; reasoning tokens aid localization while simpler variants suit crop classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between powerful vision-language models (VLMs) trained on natural images and the data-scarce domain of biomedical microscopy, enabling open-vocabulary detection with few annotated examples.

Method: Create Micro-OD benchmark for in-context learning with 252 images across 11 cell types; evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot regimes with/without test-time reasoning tokens; develop a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline combining a detector head and a VLM-based few-shot classifier; analyze end-to-end localization vs pre-localized crop classification.

Result: Zero-shot performance is poor due to domain gap; few-shot support consistently improves detection; gains plateau after about six shots; reasoning tokens boost end-to-end localization while simpler models suit crop classification; the approach provides a practical path for microscopy and the benchmark offers a reproducible testbed for open-vocabulary biomedical detection.

Conclusion: In-context adaptation is a practical and promising route for biomedical microscopy, with Micro-OD serving as a valuable benchmark to advance open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) excel on natural images, but their
utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform
few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is
often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a
curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning,
with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources,
including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight
VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit
test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object
Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based
few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on
our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak
due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves
detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models
with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas
simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our
results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and
our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary
detection in biomedical imaging.

### [10] [Automatic Extraction of Road Networks by using Teacher-Student Adaptive Structural Deep Belief Network and Its Application to Landslide Disaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05567)
*Shin Kamada,Takumi Ichimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive RBM/DBN with neuron generation-annihilation and layer generation improves RoadTracer for road-network extraction from aerial imagery, using Teacher-Student ensemble; achieves high accuracy and edge-device deployment, with disaster-response capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road network extraction from aerial imagery is challenging due to complex features and variability; an adaptive network structure can tailor capacity to data; shrinking time and deploying on edge devices are desirable for rapid disaster response.

Method: Use adaptive structural learning for RBM/DBN (neuron generation-annihilation in RBM; layer generation in DBN) within the RoadTracer framework; apply a Teacher-Student ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN; implement a lightweight model on an embedded edge device for fast inference.

Result: Detection accuracy improved from 40.0% to 89.0% on average across seven major cities; extended to detect available roads during landslide/disaster scenarios; deployed a compact model on an edge device; reported satellite-image results before and after rainfall disaster in Japan.

Conclusion: Adaptive structural learning and Teacher-Student ensemble in DBN enhance road-network extraction from aerial imagery, enabling high-accuracy detection and practical deployment on resource-constrained devices, with applicability to disaster-response scenarios.

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep
learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer
generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input
during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic
recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can
generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel
method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of
Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features
so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required.
The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model
was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among
the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the
detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in
order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small
size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as
lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite
image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

### [11] [C3-Diff: Super-resolving Spatial Transcriptomics via Cross-modal Cross-content Contrastive Diffusion Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05571)
*Xiaofei Wang,Stephen Price,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-Diff is a cross-modal diffusion framework that uses histology guidance to enhance spatial transcriptomics via refined cross-modal contrastive learning, feature hypersphere noising, and dynamic cross-modal imputation, outperforming baselines on four datasets and enabling downstream analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics currently suffers from low resolution and weak modeling of histology–gene interactions. Traditional contrastive learning is insufficient for cross-modal cross-content alignment, and ST data are scarce and noisy, hindering robust enhancement.

Method: Introduce C3-Diff: a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework. Analyze deficiencies of traditional contrastive learning and design modal-invariant and content-invariant feature extraction for ST maps and histology images. Apply noising-based information augmentation on the surface of the feature unit hypersphere. Propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity.

Result: Outperforms competing methods on four public datasets. Demonstrates improvements in downstream tasks: cell type localization, gene expression correlation, and single-cell-level gene expression prediction. Code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: C3-Diff demonstrates effective, histology-guided ST enhancement by combining diffusion with refined cross-modal contrastive learning and cross-modal imputation, addressing data scarcity and enabling improved biological insight with potential clinical relevance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene
expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original
tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST
platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth
understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise
to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of
profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the
interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST
enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive
diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images
as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional
contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both
modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images.
Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we
perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit
hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based
training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by
benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves
significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff
on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and
single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced
biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications. Codes are

### [12] [Video Text Preservation with Synthetic Text-Rich Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05573)
*Ziyang Liu,Kevin Valencia,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic supervision with T2I-generated text-rich images animated by an I2V model can fine-tune a pre-trained T2V model to improve text readability and temporal coherence without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual fidelity in Text-To-Video (T2V) generation remains challenging and costly to fix with existing methods; a lightweight, data-efficient approach is desirable.

Method: Generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model; animate them into short videos with a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model; form synthetic video-prompt pairs; fine-tune Wan2.1 (a pre-trained T2V model) without changing its architecture.

Result: Improved short-text legibility and temporal consistency; emergence of structural priors that could help longer text.

Conclusion: Curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path to boosting textual fidelity in T2V generation without architectural changes, and with low additional computational cost.

Abstract: While Text-To-Video (T2V) models have advanced rapidly, they continue to
struggle with generating legible and coherent text within videos. In
particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases
or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally
expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a
lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic
supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic
image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to
fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes.
Our results show improvement in short-text legibility and temporal consistency
with emerging structural priors for longer text. These findings suggest that
curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward
improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

### [13] [Elements of Active Continuous Learning and Uncertainty Self-Awareness: a Narrow Implementation for Face and Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05574)
*Stanislav Selitskiy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A supervising neural network monitors a CNN ensemble to detect high uncertainty and trigger active learning with human input, imbuing a form of self-awareness in a face recognition/expressions task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable narrow ML systems to self-monitor and adjust their predictions for reliability, approaching higher-level intelligence by incorporating a trustworthiness assessment and human-in-the-loop in uncertain situations.

Method: A supervising ANN observes activation patterns of an underlying CNN ensemble used for face recognition and expression tasks. It includes a memory region to store past performance and learns by adjusting its parameters to optimize outcomes. When high uncertainty is detected, it issues a trustworthiness verdict that activates active learning, allowing the system to request human assistance.

Result: A conceptual/prototype demonstration showing the feasibility of a self-awareness mechanism that detects uncertainty in a CNN ensemble and triggers active learning with human input in face-related tasks.

Conclusion: The work shows that self-awareness-like monitoring can be modeled at a narrow ML level, with a supervising network that tracks past performance and controls learning via trustworthiness judgments, enabling adaptive agency and potentially guiding toward more robust AI systems.

Abstract: Reflection on one's thought process and making corrections to it if there
exists dissatisfaction in its performance is, perhaps, one of the essential
traits of intelligence. However, such high-level abstract concepts mandatory
for Artificial General Intelligence can be modelled even at the low level of
narrow Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we present the self-awareness
mechanism emulation in the form of a supervising artificial neural network
(ANN) observing patterns in activations of another underlying ANN in a search
for indications of the high uncertainty of the underlying ANN and, therefore,
the trustworthiness of its predictions. The underlying ANN is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) ensemble employed for face recognition and facial
expression tasks. The self-awareness ANN has a memory region where its past
performance information is stored, and its learnable parameters are adjusted
during the training to optimize the performance. The trustworthiness verdict
triggers the active learning mode, giving elements of agency to the machine
learning algorithm that asks for human help in high uncertainty and confusion
conditions.

*Weston Bondurant,Arkaprava Sinha,Hieu Le,Srijan Das,Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffSwap++ uses a 3D-aware diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that conditions denoising on identity embeddings and facial landmarks to improve identity preservation and disentangle pose/expression, achieving state-of-the-art results on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text with biometric-style evaluation and user studies; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based face-swapping methods often produce artifacts and fail to disentangle identity from pose/expression due to underutilization of 3D facial structure. Incorporating 3D latent features is key to geometric consistency and better identity preservation.

Method: Train a diffusion model guided by 3D-aware representations, conditioning the denoising process on identity embeddings and facial landmarks to enable high-fidelity, identity-preserving swaps with explicit 3D guidance.

Result: Empirically outperforms prior methods on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text; includes biometric-style evaluation and a user study; code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Incorporating 3D-aware conditioning into diffusion-based face swapping improves geometry, disentanglement of identity from pose/expression, and overall swap fidelity, representing a new state-of-the-art with practical applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently achieved strong results in face swapping, offering improved visual quality over traditional GAN-based methods. However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/WestonBond/DiffSwapPP

### [15] [Beyond Softmax: Dual-Branch Sigmoid Architecture for Accurate Class Activation Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05590)
*Yoojin Oh,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch sigmoid head decouples localization from classification in CAM, eliminating additive logit shifts and sign collapse, preserving magnitude and sign of feature contributions without hurting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM and its variants rely on a final softmax classifier, which introduces additive logit shifts and sign ambiguity between excitatory/inhibitory features, distorting evidence maps. A model-agnostic way to retain classification power while yielding faithful localization signals is needed.

Method: Clone the existing classification head into a parallel branch that ends in per-class sigmoid outputs. Freeze the original softmax head and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, use the softmax head for recognition and the sigmoid branch to generate evidence maps that preserve both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. This approach is architecture-agnostic, integrates with existing CAM variants, and incurs negligible overhead.

Result: Empirical results show improved explanation fidelity on fine-grained datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) with consistent Top-1 Localization gains, and no degradation in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: A simple, integration-friendly enhancement to CAM that decouples localization from classification via a parallel sigmoid head, enabling faithful, signed feature contributions and broad compatibility with CAM methods; code released.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its extensions have become indispensable tools for visualizing the evidence behind deep network predictions. However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a MedGemma-based framework for automatic abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering.

*Subash Gautam,Alejandro Vargas-Uscategui,Peter King,Hans Lohr,Alireza Bab-Hadiashar,Ivan Cole,Ehsan Asadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time monitoring and deviation detection for high-deposition-rate robotic AM (e.g., CSAM) to enable in-process compensation and maintain part quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDRRAM processes offer high build speeds but face shape accuracy challenges due to process instabilities; early detection of deviations is essential to prevent error propagation, reduce post-processing, and ensure consistent quality.

Method: A real-time monitoring system acquires and reconstructs the growing part, compares it directly to a near-net reference model to detect shape deviations, and then segments and tracks each deviation region for timely intervention and potential compensation.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of real-time deviation detection and region-wise tracking during the build, enabling timely interventions and paving the way for in-process compensation to improve part quality.

Conclusion: Real-time monitoring and deviation segmentation provide a pathway to in-process error correction in HDRRAM processes, potentially reducing post-processing and improving consistency of manufactured parts.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging digital manufacturing technology to produce complex and freeform objects through a layer-wise deposition. High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.

*Ziying Li,Xuequan Lu,Xinkui Zhao,Guanjie Cheng,Shuiguang Deng,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TraCe, a trajectory-centric distillation for text-to-3D that reframes SDS as a Schrödinger Bridge problem to reduce artifacts and enable lower CFG, using a LoRA-adapted model trained on the trajectory's score dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address artifacts (over-saturation, over-smoothing) in optimization-based text-to-3D methods that distill diffusion priors from text-to-image models, by formulating generation as an optimal transport along a diffusion trajectory rather than a fixed denoising score.

Method: The paper shows SDS is a reverse Schrödinger Bridge under Gaussian-like conditions and reduces to SDS score. It then builds Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), which explicitly constructs a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to the text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on that trajectory's score dynamics.

Result: Empirical results indicate TraCe achieves superior quality and fidelity compared with state-of-the-art techniques, while enabling smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values.

Conclusion: TraCe provides a principled, tractable bridge between SDS and Schrödinger Bridge for text-to-3D generation, enabling robust optimization via trajectory-based distillation and LoRA fine-tuning, with strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in optimization-based text-to-3D generation heavily rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which often introduce artifacts such as over-saturation and over-smoothing into the generated 3D assets. In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.

### [19] [Pose-Aware Multi-Level Motion Parsing for Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05611)
*Shuaikang Zhu,Yang Yang,Chen Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-level parsing framework for action quality assessment (AQA) using enhanced pose features, featuring an Action-Unit Parser, Motion Parser, Condition Parser, and Weight-Adjust Scoring, achieving state-of-the-art results on diving datasets for both action segmentation and scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In action quality assessment, subtle spatial-temporal variations in pose and non-body cues (e.g., water splash) drive scores. Existing methods often struggle to jointly model precise local-global pose representations, pose dynamics, and external conditions across diverse action types. A modular framework that decouples pose-driven segmentation, motion dynamics, and auxiliary scoring factors can better capture the nuances that determine excellence.

Method: A multi-level architecture: Level 1 Action-Unit Parser uses pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and rich local-global pose representations. Level 2 Motion Parser learns spatial-temporal features to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. A dedicated Condition Parser models non-body cues influencing scores (e.g., water splash). A Weight-Adjust Scoring Module flexibly scales scores to accommodate different action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units. Evaluated on large-scale diving datasets, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results in segmentation and scoring.

Result: The framework attains state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring on large-scale diving datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level motion parsing framework effectively leverages enhanced pose features and auxiliary condition cues to improve AQA performance. Its modular design enables robust handling of diverse action types and external conditions, with strong generalization potential to other sports.

Abstract: Human pose serves as a cornerstone of action quality assessment (AQA), where subtle spatial-temporal variations in pose often distinguish excellence from mediocrity. In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units. Extensive evaluations on large-scale diving sports datasets demonstrate that our multi-level motion parsing framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring tasks.

*Connor Dunlop,Matthew Zheng,Kavana Venkatesh,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model editing framework that personalizes edits via Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO) using user-specific embeddings learned through a graph neural network to share signals across users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are generic and fail to capture individual aesthetic preferences; personalization and leveraging community signals can improve user-aligned edits.

Method: Introduce C-DPO: model user preferences as nodes in a dynamic graph; learn lightweight GNN embeddings to propagate information among users with similar tastes; integrate embeddings into a new DPO objective that optimizes both individual alignment and neighborhood coherence during diffusion-model editing.

Result: Experiments including user studies and quantitative benchmarks show C-DPO consistently outperforms baselines in producing edits aligned with user preferences.

Conclusion: This work is the first to enable personalized image editing in diffusion models, demonstrating that collaborative preference signals can be effectively integrated into DPO to tailor edits to individual and community tastes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.

*Pouya Shiri,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFC-CapsNet uses a Convolutional Fully-Connected (CFC) layer to form capsules, yielding fewer but more powerful capsules, improving efficiency and maintaining competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST compared to standard CapsNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet preserves spatial hierarchies and can outperform CNNs on some tasks, but struggles on complex datasets, is slower, and has many parameters. A more scalable, efficient capsule architecture is needed for larger datasets and real applications.

Method: Introduce a new CFC layer to construct capsules, forming a Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet). Evaluate on CIFAR-10, SVHN, Fashion-MNIST, comparing against conventional CapsNet in terms of accuracy, training/inference speed, and parameter count.

Result: CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference, and uses fewer parameters than conventional CapsNet on the tested datasets.

Conclusion: The CFC layer enables creation of more efficient, scalable capsules, addressing CapsNet limitations and offering a practical alternative for larger datasets and real-world tasks.

Abstract: A Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a relatively new classifier and one of the possible successors of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CapsNet maintains the spatial hierarchies between the features and outperforms CNNs at classifying images including overlapping categories. Even though CapsNet works well on small-scale datasets such as MNIST, it fails to achieve a similar level of performance on more complicated datasets and real applications. In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy. Our experiments show that CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference and uses less number of parameters on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physically grounded action recognition model fusing predictive world dynamics (V-JEPA 2) with explicit pose data (CoMotion) improves performance, especially under occlusion, tested on InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC; underscores spatial understanding over pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-based action recognition models rely on superficial correlations and struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes, particularly with occlusions. There is a need to ground actions in physical space by leveraging world dynamics and pose information.

Method: A fusion-based model architecture that integrates V-JEPA 2's contextual predictive world dynamics with CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data to ground action recognition in physical space.

Result: The proposed model outperforms three baselines, especially in complex, occlusive scenes, on the InHARD (general action recognition) and UCF-19-Y-OCC (high-occlusion action recognition) benchmarks.

Conclusion: Action recognition should be grounded in spatial understanding within physical space rather than relying solely on statistical pattern recognition.

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

*Mariafrancesca Patalano,Giovanna Capizzi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a registration-free, mesh-free monitoring framework for unstructured point clouds of complex shapes, using two intrinsic geometric feature-learning methods (Laplacian and geodesic distances) and a threshold-based monitoring scheme to detect defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Registration and mesh reconstruction in PCD monitoring are error-prone, time-consuming, and can introduce artifacts that affect monitoring accuracy; a direct, registration-free monitoring approach is desired.

Method: Two alternative feature-learning methods that capture intrinsic shape geometry via Laplacian operators and geodesic distances, combined with a common monitoring scheme that uses thresholding to select the most indicative features of potential out-of-control conditions.

Result: Numerical experiments and case studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying various defect types without requiring registration or mesh reconstruction.

Conclusion: A registration-free, mesh-free monitoring framework for PCD of complex shapes can reliably detect defects while avoiding preprocessing steps that may introduce artifacts, reducing time, and broadening applicability across manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CULTIVate introduces a cross-cultural benchmark for text-to-image models focusing on activities rather than objects, with 16 countries, 576 prompts, and 19k images. It uses a descriptor-based evaluation across background, attire, objects, and interactions, proposing four metrics: cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggeration, and diversity. Findings show north-centric performance gaps and validation that metrics align with human judgments better than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cultural biases in diffusion models that are not captured by object-centric benchmarks, by measuring faithfulness of depictions of everyday cultural activities across countries.

Method: Construct a benchmark (CULTIVate) with prompts spanning cross-cultural activities across 16 countries; develop a descriptor-based evaluation framework across background, attire, objects, and interactions; define four metrics (cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggeration, diversity); validate with human studies to assess correlation with judgments.

Result: Reveals systematic disparities: models perform better for global north than global south and show distinct failure modes across T2I systems; human studies show the proposed metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

Conclusion: CULTIVate provides a targeted, explainable toolset for evaluating cross-cultural fidelity in T2I models and highlights persistent biases, guiding future data curation and model alignment toward fairer, more representative image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve impressive photorealism by training on large-scale web data, but models inherit cultural biases and fail to depict underrepresented regions faithfully. Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirm that our metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VMDT, a unified benchmark for text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five trustworthiness dimensions (safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, adversarial robustness); reports systemic issues in open-source T2V models and scale-dependent risks in V2T models; safety does not track with model size; provides code and framework for measuring progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video foundation models lack comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks across modalities. A unified platform is needed to evaluate T2V and V2T models on safety, fairness, privacy, hallucination, and robustness.

Method: Evaluate 7 T2V and 19 V2T models using the VMDT framework across five trustworthiness dimensions; analyze correlations with model size and other factors; report notable trends and insights.

Result: All evaluated open-source T2V models fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, and show higher unfairness than image-domain models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks increase with scale, while hallucination and adversarial robustness improve, though overall performance remains low. Safety shows no correlation with model size.

Conclusion: VMDT provides a systematic framework to measure and track progress toward more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, highlighting urgent needs for improved benchmarks and models in this domain.

Abstract: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

TL;DR: Accurate dual-view pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation using screw combination evaluation and 2D-3D alignment with CAD models; improves pairing and registration, reducing projection error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenging problem of establishing screw correspondence and pose, especially in LAT views, to improve surgical accuracy in spinal instrumentation.

Method: Compare potential screw pairings across AP and LAT dual C-arm images; perform 2D-3D alignment using CAD 3D models to estimate screw pose; evaluate correctness of combinations before and after registration.

Result: Correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases; registration further improves alignment and reduces projection error.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for enhancing screw positioning feedback and potentially improves surgical outcomes in spinal procedures.

Abstract: Accurate matching of pedicle screws in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) images is critical for successful spinal decompression and stabilization during surgery. However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.

TL;DR: A scalable two-stage data-generation framework produces 1M+ vision-centric synthetic questions with reasoning traces; finetuned models show strong cross-domain transfer and insights into RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparent, scalable datasets for vision-centric reasoning beyond visual math; explore synthetic data generation, RL prompts, and cross-modality transfer.

Method: Two-stage data synthesis: (1) scale, (2) complexity; generate chain-of-thought traces via VLMs and reasoning LLMs; include preference data and RL prompts for offline/online RL; train with supervised fine-tuning and staged RL; evaluate across vision-centric benchmarks.

Result: Finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the synthetic data outperforms open-data baselines across vision-centric benchmarks and surpasses MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench, and MMStar-V; transfers to text-only (MMLU-Pro) and audio (MMAU) reasoning; gains on NiEH embodied QA; SFT with non-linear reasoning traces is key for online RL; staged offline RL matches online RL with less compute; data quality improves cross-modality transfer.

Conclusion: Synthetic vision-centric data, with careful SFT/RL design, enables strong cross-domain performance and efficient training; provides a scalable path for large datasets and actionable guidance on trace design and RL strategies.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

*Xing Yao,Ahana Gangopadhyay,Hsi-Ming Chang,Ravi Soni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data-centric study on adapting SAM2 to ultrasound video segmentation showing data scale and temporal context are more critical than model architecture; joint training offers a practical balance. Six ultrasound-specific augmentations were proposed and tested across three adaptation paradigms and five SAM2 variants on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's zero-shot performance declines in medical imaging, and prior work focused on architectural tweaks rather than data characteristics and training regimes. There is a need to systematically understand how data properties and training strategies influence adaptation in ultrasound video analysis.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three adaptation paradigms—task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training—across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. The study varies training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes, including six ultrasound-specific augmentations, and compares them on three ultrasound datasets.

Result: Across datasets, data scale and temporal context dominate over architecture or initialization in driving adaptation performance. Joint training efficiently balances modality alignment with task specialization, offering a practical path for data-aware SAM2 adaptation in ultrasound video analysis.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical guidelines for constructing data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video segmentation and emphasize prioritizing data characteristics and temporal information over architectural changes.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) video segmentation remains a challenging problem due to strong inter- and intra-dataset variability, motion artifacts, and limited annotated data. Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis.

*Mateo Ortiz,Juan Olmos,Fabio Martínez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Second-order geometric attention (SOGA) on SPD/Riemannian manifolds guides a segmentation network to detect csPCa in bp-MRI. Integrated into U-Net/nnU-Net via skip connections, it improves lesion detection, showing competitive gains and strong cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate csPCa detection from bp-MRI is highly subjective and dataset-limited. Lesion variability across prostate zones makes robust detection challenging. A geometry-aware attention mechanism leveraging SPD representations aims to provide discriminative features and improve segmentation reliability.

Method: Introduce SOGA, a second-order geometric attention mechanism modeled on Riemannian manifolds using SPD representations. Integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones via skip connections to steer feature learning toward csPCa lesions.

Result: On PI-CAI: AP 0.37, AUC-ROC 0.83. On Prostate158: AP 0.37, AUC-ROC 0.75. Outperforms baseline networks and other attention-based methods, indicating robust generalization and discriminative representations.

Conclusion: SOGA effectively leverages geometric information in SPD space to guide segmentation networks, yielding robust csPCa detection across datasets and suggesting a promising direction for geometry-aware medical image analysis.

Abstract: The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.

Conclusion: A Graph-GRU skeleton-based approach is effective for isolated sign language recognition and underscores the potential of pose-driven methods for sign language understanding.

Abstract: This work presents an approach for recognizing isolated sign language gestures using skeleton-based pose data extracted from video sequences. A Graph-GRU temporal network is proposed to model both spatial and temporal dependencies between frames, enabling accurate classification. The model is trained and evaluated on the AUTSL (Ankara university Turkish sign language) dataset, achieving high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph-based spatial representations with temporal modeling, providing a scalable framework for sign language recognition. The results of this approach highlight the potential of pose-driven methods for sign language understanding.

### [31] [TCSA-UDA: Text-Driven Cross-Semantic Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05782)
*Lalit Maurya,Honghai Liu,Reyer Zwiggelaar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces TCSA-UDA, a text-driven cross-semantic alignment framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation, using a vision-language covariance cosine loss and prototype alignment to unify domain-invariant semantics, achieving state-of-the-art results in cross-modality segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts across imaging modalities (e.g., CT vs MRI) cause large performance gaps in medical image segmentation. Existing UDA methods underutilize semantic relationships and textual descriptions. Vision-language pretraining suggests leveraging domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representations, potentially improving modality-invariant segmentation.

Method: Two main components: (1) vision-language covariance cosine loss that aligns image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations to promote semantically meaningful, modality-invariant features; (2) a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes to reduce residual category-level discrepancies and improve cross-domain consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that TCSA-UDA reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

Conclusion: Text-driven cross-semantic alignment effectively mitigates modality gaps in medical image segmentation. The framework demonstrates the potential of language-guided semantics for domain-adaptive medical imaging and may inspire further exploration of multimodal UDA approaches.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

*Xuqing Geng,Lei Su,Zhongwei Bian,Zewen Sun,Jiaxuan Wen,Jie Tian,Yang Du*

TL;DR: Incorporating symmetric positional priors into deep-learning SR-based calibration of MPI System Matrix improves calibration efficiency and accuracy, validated theoretically and in 2D/3D experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the time-consuming, parameter-sensitive calibration of the MPI System Matrix by leveraging physical priors that reflect symmetry in the acquisition geometry.

Method: Integrate positional priors into existing SR frameworks for SM calibration, supported by theoretical justification; validate the approach with 2D and 3D SM SR experiments.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that including positional priors enhances SM SR calibration performance across both 2D and 3D settings.

Conclusion: Positional priors are beneficial for SM calibration in MPI, improving efficiency and accuracy, with theoretical backing and cross-dimensional validation.

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel medical imaging modality. One of the established methods for MPI reconstruction is based on the System Matrix (SM). However, the calibration of the SM is often time-consuming and requires repeated measurements whenever the system parameters change. Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.

### [33] [MACMD: Multi-dilated Contextual Attention and Channel Mixer Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05803)
*Lalit Maurya,Honghai Liu,Reyer Zwiggelaar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a MACMD-based decoder for medical image segmentation that fuses local details with global context using hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and cross-channel mixing between encoder and decoder via skip connections; demonstrates superior Dice scores and efficiency across binary and multi-organ segmentation with multiple transformer encoders; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation requires capturing both fine-grained local details and long-range global context. CNNs excel at local features but miss long-range dependencies; transformers address global context yet can neglect local detail. Encoder-decoder architectures suffer from information loss in deep layers and suboptimal integration of local and global information between stages.

Method: Propose a MACMD-based decoder that enhances attention mechanisms and enables channel mixing between encoder and decoder via skip connections. Key components include hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to preserve local details while modeling long-range dependencies. Evaluated with multiple transformer encoders on binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Dice score and computational efficiency across the tested tasks and encoders.

Conclusion: MACMD-based decoder effectively balances local contextual preservation with global dependency modeling, improving robustness and accuracy in medical image segmentation and generalizing across different transformer encoders; code released at GitHub.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

### [34] [LRANet++: Low-Rank Approximation Network for Accurate and Efficient Text Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05818)
*Yuchen Su,Zhineng Chen,Yongkun Du,Zuxuan Wu,Hongtao Xie,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRANet++ proposes a data-driven low-rank text-shape model and a triple-assignment detection head to achieve accurate and efficient end-to-end spotting of arbitrary-shaped text, integrating a lightweight recognition branch for fast inference with state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main bottleneck in end-to-end text spotting for arbitrary-shaped text is obtaining a reliable and efficient text detection method. Existing shape representations are often data-irrelevant and sensitive to annotation noise, hindering both accuracy and speed. This work aims to create a robust, compact, and fast detection module that can be integrated with lightweight recognition.

Method: 1) A parameterized text shape representation learned from labeled text boundaries via low-rank subspace; 2) An l1-norm based recovery method to robustly reconstruct shapes using few orthogonal vectors, mitigating annotation noise; 3) A triple assignment detection head consisting of a deep sparse branch (stabilized training) guiding an ultra-light sparse branch (fast inference) and a dense branch providing rich supervision; 4) End-to-end integration with a lightweight recognition branch to form LRANet++ for accurate and efficient arbitrary-shaped text spotting.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LRANet++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency for end-to-end text spotting of arbitrary-shaped text.

Conclusion: The proposed low-rank, data-driven shape parameterization and the triple-assignment detection head deliver robust, compact, and fast text detection that, when coupled with a lightweight recognizer, yields superior end-to-end performance on irregular text. The authors also provide code release for reproducibility.

Abstract: End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [35] [Hilbert-Guided Block-Sparse Local Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05832)
*Yunge Li,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hilbert-curve-based reordering for 2D local attention increases block sparsity and yields large speedups, enabling practical Hilbert Window and Hilbert Slide attention with minimal accuracy loss (code available).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global self-attention on high-resolution images is quadratic in compute and memory. Local attention reduces this cost but conventional patterns often fail to provide large speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in 1D. The goal is to design window patterns that increase block sparsity and speed up 2D local attention.

Method: Reorder image tokens along a Hilbert curve and form windows and neighborhoods on the reordered 1D sequence. This Hilbert-guided approach can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to enhance 2D local attention. Proposed: Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention, instantiated as Hilbert Window Transformer and Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer.

Result: Experiments show about 4x speedup for window attention and about 18x speedup for slide attention. End-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss for Hilbert Window Transformer and Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer.

Conclusion: Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels provides a general, practical approach to improving 2D image local attention efficiency, with released code for replication.

Abstract: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

TL;DR: TYrPPG proposes a lightweight rPPG model using a Mambaout-based gated video understanding block (GVB) that fuses 2D- and 3D-CNNs, combined with a comprehensive supervised loss (CSL) and weakly supervised variants, achieving state-of-the-art heart-rate estimation on standard datasets with available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remotely estimated heart rate via rPPG is cost-effective and noninvasive, but transformer-based rPPG models are computation-heavy. The Mambaout core hints at a lighter alternative; this work tests its viability for vision tasks and rPPG.

Method: Introduce GVB built on Mambaout; integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN for video understanding; propose CSL loss and weakly supervised variants to improve learning; evaluate on widely used datasets; release code.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used datasets for remote heart-rate estimation; demonstrates superiority and practicality.

Conclusion: TYrPPG demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of Mambaout-based modules for efficient remote heart-rate estimation; holds promise for efficient video analysis with lower computation.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can remotely extract physiological signals from RGB video, which has many advantages in detecting heart rate, such as low cost and no invasion to patients. The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CLFA to repurpose CLIP for handwriting-based Alzheimer's screening, enabling zero-shot inference and cross-task generalization to identify discriminative handwriting tasks and patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, non-invasive detection of Alzheimer's disease via handwriting is promising but underexplored; existing studies rely on handcrafted features and single tasks. There is a need to understand task-type effects and cross-task generalization, and to leverage strong multi-modal models like CLIP for this modality.

Method: Proposes a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter (CLFA) that injects multi-level adapters into CLIP's visual encoder to progressively align representations with handwriting-specific medical cues. The approach enables prompt-free zero-shot inference. The study trains and tests cross-task generalization by training on one handwriting task and evaluating on unseen tasks, coupled with extensive analyses of stroke patterns and task-level factors.

Result: CLFA enables efficient zero-shot inference and reveals which handwriting tasks and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses identify characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors contributing to early identification and provide a diagnostic benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

Conclusion: A CLIP-based, lightweight, cross-task framework can facilitate handwriting-based AD screening, offering cross-task generalization, diagnostic insights, and a benchmark dataset or protocol for handwriting-centric cognitive assessment.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-pronged enhancement for classifier-guided diffusion: (1) differentiable calibration via Smooth ECE to improve classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning; (2) divergence-aware sampling methods (tilted sampling, adaptive entropy regularization, and f-divergence sampling) that improve guidance without retraining diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 128x128.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overconfident early denoising predictions that collapses the guidance gradient in classifier-guided diffusion, leading to suboptimal conditional generation.

Method: Introduce differentiable Smooth ECE-based calibration objective; apply mild fine-tuning. Develop off-the-shelf classifier guidance enhancements: tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling, and f-divergence-based sampling to strengthen class-consistent guidance while preserving mode coverage, without retraining diffusion model.

Result: Divergence-regularized guidance achieves FID 2.13 on ImageNet 128x128 using a ResNet-101; outperforms existing classifier-guided diffusion methods; requires no diffusion model retraining; shows improved calibration leads to better guidance.

Conclusion: Calibration and divergence-aware sampling are practical, effective enhancements for classifier-guided diffusion, enabling better conditional image generation without retraining diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

TL;DR: Introduces CPS3D-Seg, a high-quality 3D point-cloud dataset for ceramic package substrate surface defects, and CINet, a causal-inference based segmentation model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public CPS datasets are scarce and defects are subtle, making 3D CPS surface defect detection challenging. A high-quality dataset and robust segmentation method are needed to advance industrial inspection.

Method: Created CPS3D-Seg with 1,300 point-cloud samples across 20 product categories, with precise point-level annotations and superior resolution. Performed benchmarking of SOTA 3D segmentation models on the dataset. Proposed CINet, a segmentation network leveraging causal inference via Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) modules to quantify confounders in point clouds.

Result: CINet substantially outperforms existing segmentation algorithms in both mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) and accuracy on CPS3D-Seg across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CPS3D-Seg enables more reliable CPS surface defect detection due to its high-quality annotations and coverage, and CINet demonstrates effective mitigation of confounding factors in 3D segmentation, marking a step forward for industrial 3D defect analysis.

Abstract: The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.

### [40] [CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865)
*Viet Nguyen,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE) is a plug-and-play framework that robustly erases unsafe concepts from generative models by minimally perturbing unsafe text embeddings at inference time, using multiple lightweight classifiers to detect and refine prompts, achieving strong resistance to red-teaming while preserving benign generation; scalable to multi-concept erasure without weight changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns in large-scale generative models: unsafe content generation, vulnerability of existing concept erasure methods to adversarial attacks, and the trade-off between robust erasure and generative quality. A scalable, efficient, non-destructive solution is needed.

Method: A lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings detects prompts containing undesired concepts and refines prompts to modify unsafe embeddings at inference time. The framework is plug-and-play, supports multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers, and does not alter the model weights, enabling application to diverse T2I and T2V models.

Result: CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks, while maintaining high generative utility. It is demonstrated across modern text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: CGCE provides a practical, scalable solution for safe generative AI that robustly erases undesired concepts without sacrificing benign content quality or requiring retraining, with broad applicability to current generative models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

### [41] [Light-Field Dataset for Disparity Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05866)
*Suresh Nehra,Aupendu Kar,Jayanta Mukhopadhyay,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A public light-field dataset is introduced, including 285 real Lytro Illum LF images, 13 synthetic LF images, a synthetic dataset with similar disparity, and real+synthetic stereo LF datasets created with a gantry and Blender; the dataset supports disparity-based depth estimation and focal-position studies, and is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift between angular (disparity) and spatial information in light-field imaging depends on focal position. There is a need for comprehensive real and synthetic datasets to develop, test, and benchmark disparity-based LF depth estimation algorithms and to understand current dataset shortcomings.

Method: Collect and generate a diverse LF dataset: 285 real LF images from a Lytro Illum, 13 synthetic LF images, plus a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics. Create a real and synthetic stereo LF dataset using a mechanical gantry and Blender. Provide dataset description and release at a public repository.

Result: Describes the dataset composition, demonstrates the effect of focal position on 3-D point disparity, and identifies shortcomings of existing light-field datasets; makes the dataset publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The dataset offers a valuable resource for developing and evaluating disparity-based LF depth estimation, enabling analysis of focal-position effects and supporting both real and synthetic LF data, including stereo configurations.

Abstract: A Light Field (LF) camera consists of an additional two-dimensional array of micro-lenses placed between the main lens and sensor, compared to a conventional camera. The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera. A real and synthetic stereo light field dataset is also created by using a mechanical gantry system and Blender. The dataset is available at https://github.com/aupendu/light-field-dataset.

*Jian Zhu,Xin Zou,Jun Sun,Cheng Luo,Lei Liu,Lingfang Zeng,Ning Zhang,Bian Wu,Chang Tang,Lirong Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MoEGCL, a GNN-based multi-view clustering method that fuses ego graphs at the sample level via a mixture-of-experts (MoEGF) and uses ego-graph contrastive learning (EGCL) to align fused and view-specific representations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MVC methods rely on coarse, view-level graph fusion, which potentially loses fine-grained cross-view information and per-sample relationships; a finer-grained fusion scheme could improve clustering performance.

Method: Construct ego graphs for each sample in every view. Use a Mixture-of-Experts network to fuse the ego graphs at the sample level (MoEGF), enabling fine-grained integration across views. Introduce Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) to align the fused representation with view-specific representations, promoting intra-cluster similarity across samples.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on deep multi-view clustering tasks. The authors provide publicly available source code at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: MoEGCL achieves finer-grained graph fusion through MoEGF and strengthens representation alignment via EGCL, leading to improved clustering performance in multi-view settings and offering a new direction for ego-graph–based fusion in MVC.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

### [43] [Towards Frequency-Adaptive Learning for SAR Despeckling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05890)
*Ziqing Ma,Chang Yang,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-FAH uses wavelet-based frequency partitioning and specialized sub-networks to despeck SAR images; low-frequency denoised via neural ODEs, high-frequency via deformable-conv U-Net; achieves better edge/texture preservation and noise suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified networks ignore frequency-dependent speckle statistics, causing artifacts and texture distortion; a frequency-aware, divide-and-conquer approach can better preserve structure while removing noise.

Method: Decompose SAR image into frequency sub-bands with wavelets; design a low-frequency branch as continuous neural ODE for smooth structural fidelity; design high-frequency branch as enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for detailed edges/textures; train on synthetic and real SAR data.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images show superior noise removal and structural preservation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling framework is effective for SAR despeckling and can reduce artifacts while preserving edges and textures; wavelet-based division enables targeted processing per frequency band.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex occlusions and varying illumination in facial recognition by capturing local structure with a novel descriptor and exploiting global correlations of structured noise.

Method: Introduce H2H descriptor; integrate with Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR_NMR); impose a global low-rank constraint on the residual; optimize for regression-based classification.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over existing regression-based approaches under occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Conclusion: The combination of local structural encoding and global low-rank residual modeling yields robust recognition in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely applied in the field of face recognition. To further address the challenges caused by complex occlusions and illumination variations, this paper proposes a Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called the Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) is first designed to more effectively characterize the local structural features of facial images. Then, this descriptor is integrated with the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR$\_$NMR). Moreover, a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix, enabling the model to better capture the global correlations inherent in structured noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios involving occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Conclusion: Open-vocabulary perception combined with retrieval-based reasoning provides a scalable, interactive approach for 3D scene understanding in open-world settings.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes in open-world settings poses fundamental challenges for vision and robotics, particularly due to the limitations of closed-vocabulary supervision and static annotations. To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces GABFusion and ADA to improve quantized multi-task networks; achieves consistent gains across architectures and QAT methods, with theoretical gradient-bias guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization-aware training often degrades performance on multi-task networks due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts; there is a need for quantization-friendly, gradient-aware feature fusion and distillation.

Method: GABFusion dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. ADA (Attention Distribution Alignment) is a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. The framework provides theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction and is modular and compatible with existing QAT techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and enhances quantized multi-task models without changing the original architectures, making QAT more effective across tasks and bit-widths.

Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

### [47] [Causal Tracing of Object Representations in Large Vision Language Models: Mechanistic Interpretability and Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05923)
*Qiming Li,Zekai Ye,Xiaocheng Feng,Weihong Zhong,Weitao Ma,Xiachong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-grained causal tracing framework (FCCT) for LVLMs analyzes visual/textual tokens, MHSA, FFNs, and hidden states across all decoder layers to reveal mechanisms of cross-modal perception and storage/transfer of visual information; leads to IRI, a training-free inference-time intervention that improves perception and reduces hallucination, achieving state-of-the-art results on five LVLM benchmarks while maintaining speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability of LVLMs is shallow and coarse, lacking systematic analysis across visual/textual tokens, core components (MHSA, FFN, hidden states), and all decoder layers, hindering actionable improvements for faithfulness and tasks like hallucination mitigation.

Method: Introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) to quantify causal effects on visual object perception across fine-grained visual/textual tokens, three model components (MHSA, FFNs, hidden states), and all decoder layers. Use these insights to design Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that intervenes on cross-modal representations at specific components/layers to reinforce visual object information flow.

Result: FCCT reveals that last-token in middle layers of MHSA critically aggregates cross-modal information; FFNs show a three-stage hierarchical progression for storage/transfer of visual object representations. IRI yields consistent improvements across five LVLM benchmarks and models, achieving state-of-the-art performance while preserving inference speed and other foundational metrics.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed mechanistic map of cross-modal information flow in LVLMs, identifying key roles of MHSA and FFN stages. It presents IRI as a practical, training-free method to boost perception and mitigate hallucination, with broad applicability and robust gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.

### [48] [CoMA: Complementary Masking and Hierarchical Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention in a Unified Pre-training Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05929)
*Jiaxuan Li,Qing Xu,Xiangjian He,Ziyu Liu,Chang Xing,Zhen Chen,Daokun Zhang,Rong Qu,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMA introduces complementary masking to MAE to ensure uniform pixel sampling, improving feature learning and adaptability; DyViT adds Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention to reduce parameters/FLOPs while preserving fine-grained learning; with ImageNet-1K pretraining, CoMA+DyViT matches MAE performance using only 12% of pretraining epochs and saves ~10% pretraining time per epoch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MAE with random masking suffers inefficiency: longer pretraining to maintain adaptability; fixed spatial resolution across layers hampers parameter efficiency. There is a need for uniform pixel coverage and more efficient transformer architectures.

Method: Propose CoMA with complementary masking for uniform pixel sampling; develop DyViT with DM-MSA in a hierarchical ViT to reduce parameters/FLOPs and enhance fine-grained features.

Result: Pretraining on ImageNet-1K with CoMA; DyViT matches MAE downstream performance with only 12% of the pretraining epochs and reduces pretraining time per epoch by about 10%. Indicates improved pretraining efficiency and robust downstream performance.

Conclusion: CoMA and DyViT collectively improve pretraining efficiency and feature learning, enabling faster, potentially more accurate downstream performance; suggests a viable path for efficient self-supervised vision transformers.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a conditionable diffusion auto-encoder to enable unsupervised, controllable generation of disease progression from a baseline image by applying restricted latent shifts in a diffusion-based latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling longitudinal disease progression in high-dimensional images without subject-specific longitudinal supervision is challenging; existing methods cap controllability due to distribution-learning constraints.

Method: Use an image-diffusion auto-encoder to form a compact latent space with high-level semantics, then apply controlled shifts to baseline latent representations restricted to a progression subspace. Shifts are implicitly guided by progression attributes without subject-specific longitudinal supervision. Validate with image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream Alzheimer’s classification across two datasets.

Result: Demonstrates controllable generation of progression images from a baseline, yielding plausible progression changes and improvements in image quality metrics, progression analysis, and classification performance across two Alzheimer’s datasets from different sources.

Conclusion: The conditionable diffusion auto-encoder provides a scalable, unsupervised framework for controllable longitudinal image generation of disease progression and can disentangle progression factors from subject identity across datasets.

Abstract: Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.

*Lin Li,Chuhan Zhang,Dong Zhang,Chong Sun,Chen Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACC: an interaction-centric end-to-end OVSGG framework that explicitly models object interactions to improve knowledge infusion and transfer, achieving state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSGG methods rely on a two-stage pipeline and lack explicit interaction modeling, leading to noisy pseudo-supervision during infusion and ambiguous query matching during transfer.

Method: ACC introduces two interaction-centric components: (1) interaction-centric knowledge infusion with bidirectional interaction prompts to generate robust pseudo-supervision and enhance interaction knowledge; (2) interaction-centric knowledge transfer featuring interaction-guided query selection to pair interacting objects and interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to separate relational foreground from background while preserving general knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the interaction-centric paradigm for OVSGG.

Conclusion: Modeling interactions explicitly within an end-to-end OVSGG framework reduces mismatches in both infusion and transfer stages and shows strong potential for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\textbf{AC}tion-\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.

TL;DR: Introduces GME-Net for low-resolution facial expression recognition to address loss of detail and weak global modeling by combining a hybrid attention-based local feature extractor with knowledge distillation from a high-resolution network, plus a multi-scale global feature extractor with a quasi-symmetric design, yielding improved performance on low-resolution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-res facial expression recognition suffers from missing detail and insufficient global context; existing methods perform weak global modeling, hindering discriminative feature extraction.

Method: Proposes GME-Net with two main components: (1) hybrid attention-based local feature extraction with attention similarity knowledge distillation from a high-resolution network to learn details; (2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with a quasi-symmetric structure to capture global features while reducing local noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets show GME-Net better recognizes low-res facial expressions and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GME-Net provides an effective framework for low-resolution facial expression recognition by integrating local detail-focused attention with global multi-scale features and distillation from high-res networks, improving robustness to low-resolution inputs.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition, as a vital computer vision task, is garnering significant attention and undergoing extensive research. Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.

Abstract: The perception of high-definition maps is an integral component of environmental perception in autonomous driving systems. Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Reperio-rPPG framework that captures periodic structure in rPPG signals using Relational Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformer, with CutMix augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art robustness on multiple datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The intrinsic periodicity of physiological signals is underexplored in rPPG methods, limiting modeling of fine-grained temporal dynamics in real-world conditions. A robust, generalizable approach across datasets and varying conditions is needed.

Method: Integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to exploit the periodic structure of physiological signals, plus a tailored CutMix augmentation. Evaluated on three benchmarks (PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD) under diverse motion and illumination scenarios.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong robustness to motion (stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination (nature, low LED, high LED) across the datasets.

Conclusion: Reperio-rPPG advances remote photoplethysmography by explicitly modeling periodicity to improve temporal dynamics capture and generalization; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

*Chang Li,Xingtao Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost unsupervised polygon matching pipeline (U(PM)^2) that combines pre-trained models with handcrafted features to match polygons without training, achieving strong accuracy and generalization on ScanNet/SceneFlow with competitive speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polygon matching is under-explored and faces disparity discontinuities, scale variation, training requirements, and limited generalization. The paper aims to enable accurate polygon matching without supervision by leveraging pre-trained models and a hybrid feature strategy.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) Mask extraction using a pre-trained Segment Anything model to obtain masks; 2) Vectorization converting masks to polygons and their graph structure; 3) Global matching via a bidirectional-pyramid strategy using a pre-trained LoFTR to handle viewpoint/scale changes, followed by a local matching stage that resolves local disparity discontinuities and topology inconsistencies through local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching with the Hungarian algorithm.

Result: On ScanNet and SceneFlow, using a new evaluation metric, the method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at competitive speed and shows satisfactory generalization at low cost without any training.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that marrying pre-trained segmentation and feature-based matching with a lightweight, unsupervised polygon matching pipeline can achieve high accuracy and robust generalization, with low computation and no training requirements.

Abstract: Stereo image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing, but there is an almost unexplored field, i.e., polygon matching, which faces the following challenges: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel U(PM)$^2$: low-cost unsupervised polygon matching with pre-trained models by uniting automatically learned and handcrafted features, of which pipeline is as follows: firstly, the detector leverages the pre-trained segment anything model to obtain masks; then, the vectorizer converts the masks to polygons and graphic structure; secondly, the global matcher addresses challenges from global viewpoint changes and scale variation based on bidirectional-pyramid strategy with pre-trained LoFTR; finally, the local matcher further overcomes local disparity discontinuity and topology inconsistency of polygon matching by local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching strategy with Hungarian algorithm. We benchmark our U(PM)$^2$ on the ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets using our proposed new metric, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy at a competitive speed and satisfactory generalization performance at low cost without any training requirement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-modal image-to-point cloud registration framework that uses Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) and Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) to improve robustness under noise, selecting informative representations and guiding cross-modal interactions; achieves state-of-the-art on RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection-free cross-modal registration methods using transformers struggle under noisy conditions, where noise disturbs similarity computation and incorrect correspondences arise. Without dedicated mechanisms to select informative and correlated representations across modalities, robustness and accuracy are limited.

Method: Proposes two modules: (1) Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) that enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and uses reinforcement-learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents; (2) Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) that leverages the selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions and reduce mismatches, improving robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks show the method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed IAS and RAI framework enhances cross-modal registration by reliably selecting informative agents and guiding their interactions, yielding improved robustness and accuracy under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Yuxuan Lin,Hanjing Yan,Xuan Tong,Yang Chang,Huanzhen Wang,Ziheng Zhou,Shuyong Gao,Yan Wang,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method CIF (Commonality In Few) uses hypergraph-based intra-class structural commonality and a memory bank to guide detection, with training-free hypergraph message passing and hyperedge-guided memory search, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies in few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is critical yet underexplored. Limited training samples fail to cover diverse test patterns; leveraging intra-class structural commonality from few examples can improve generalization and reduce false positives.

Method: 1) semantic-aware hypergraph construction to extract intra-class common structures from single-semantic industrial images; 2) a memory bank storing intra-class structural priors guided by the semantic hypergraph; 3) a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update test features and narrow the distribution gap to memory features; 4) a hyperedge-guided memory search to leverage structural information and reduce false positives.

Result: Experimental results on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies show the proposed CIF method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: CIF demonstrates that exploiting structural commonality via semantic hypergraphs and memory-guided search is effective for few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection, with code available at the cited repository.

Abstract: Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MST using a DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer evaluated on abbreviated breast MRI to rule out BI-RADS >=4. It achieves about AUC 0.77; at 97.5% sensitivity specificity ~19% (contrast-enhanced) and ~17% (non-contrast). External validation AUC also ~0.77 with 88% attention maps rated good/moderate. Not yet ready for clinical deployment; further validation needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is highly sensitive for breast cancer but interpretation is time-consuming. The study explores AI-based pre-screening to triage BI-RADS >=4 lesions and potentially reduce radiologist workload.

Method: Retrospective multicenter study. Internal data: 1,847 single-breast MRIs (377 BI-RADS >=4). External validation: 924 exams (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2w, and T1sub+T2w. Model: DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST). Evaluation with five-fold cross-validation; performance reported at 90%, 95%, 97.5% sensitivity; AUC with DeLong test; false negatives characterized; external attention maps rated for quality.

Result: AUC around 0.77 across setups. At 97.5% sensitivity, highest specificity was 19% (T1sub+T2w) and 17% (DWI1500+T2w). Missed lesions tended to be <10 mm, often non-mass enhancements. External validation AUC 0.77; attention maps in external data deemed good/moderate in 88% of cases.

Conclusion: MST can correctly triage cases without BI-RADS >=4 at modest specificity, achieving ~17–19% specificity at high sensitivity. External validation supports generalizability, but more work is required before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

*Nagur Shareef Shaik,Teja Krishna Cherukuri,Adnan Masood,Dong Hye Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DiA-gnostic VLVAE for robust radiology reporting by disentangling shared and modality-specific features to handle missing modalities and reduce spurious fusion, enabling a compact decoder to generate reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical radiology data often lacks complete context and suffers from entangled modality information, causing unreliable reports; existing approaches rely on heavy LLMs or static graphs and are not resilient to missing data. There is a need for a compact, robust, and faithful reporting framework.

Method: Mixture-of-Experts based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE) that disentangles shared vs modality-specific features; constrained optimization enforces orthogonality and alignment between latent spaces; a compact LLaMA-X decoder generates reports; evaluated on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR.

Result: BLEU-4 scores of 0.266 (IU X-Ray) and 0.134 (MIMIC-CXR); the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Disentangled alignment improves robustness to missing modalities and yields clinically interpretable, faithful radiology reports with efficient decoding; the approach demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of runtime safety monitoring for DNN-based perception, classifying approaches into input-level, internal-representation, and output monitors, and outlining their strengths, limitations, mappings to safety concerns, and directions for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs used in safety-critical perception systems are vulnerable to generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks. Runtime monitors operating alongside DNNs during inference can detect these hazards without modifying the DNN.

Method: Systematic literature review and taxonomy. The paper analyzes state-of-the-art within each monitoring category (inputs, internal representations, outputs), assesses strengths/limitations, maps methods to safety concerns, and identifies open challenges and future research directions.

Result: Proposes a taxonomy of runtime safety monitoring approaches, with cross-category mappings to safety concerns, and a synthesis of gaps and opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: Runtime safety monitoring is a viable approach to enhance DNN safety without modifying models, but there are open challenges (e.g., real-time constraints, benchmarks, evaluative metrics, integration across systems). The paper calls for further research to advance monitoring methods and standards.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in perception systems for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to various safety concerns, including generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks, which can lead to hazardous failures. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of runtime safety monitoring approaches, which operate in parallel to DNNs during inference to detect these safety concerns without modifying the DNN itself. We categorize existing methods into three main groups: Monitoring inputs, internal representations, and outputs. We analyze the state-of-the-art for each category, identify strengths and limitations, and map methods to the safety concerns they address. In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conditional denoising diffusion model with ViT encoder and UNet decoder, augmented by Adaptive Conditioning Bridge, Topological Denoising Consistency loss, and a dual-head setup, achieving state-of-the-art breast ultrasound segmentation with high Dice scores and anatomically plausible outputs; validated by ablation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of standard CNNs in capturing global context, dealing with low-contrast noise in breast ultrasound, and ensuring anatomically plausible segmentations, especially on small datasets.

Method: Integrates a conditional Denoising Diffusion Model with an enhanced UNet-based decoder and ViT encoder. Introduces Adaptive Conditioning Bridge for multi-scale semantic fusion; Topological Denoising Consistency loss to penalize structural inconsistencies during denoising; dual-head architecture with a lightweight auxiliary head and a noise-prediction head trained with the denoising objective as regularizer.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.96 (BUSI), 0.90 (BrEaST), 0.97 (BUS-UCLM). Ablation studies confirm each component's importance and that outputs are accurate and anatomically plausible.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets a new state-of-the-art in breast ultrasound segmentation, with components contributing to both accuracy and anatomical plausibility, and offers efficient inference on small datasets via the auxiliary head.

Abstract: In breast ultrasound images, precise lesion segmentation is essential for early diagnosis; however, low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries make this difficult. Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated-object pose tracking is underexplored and challenging due to kinematic constraints and complexity of non-rigid parts; existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse articulations and environments.

Method: The method first quasi-canonicalizes point clouds in SE(3) space, then models articulated objects with Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters, leveraging SE(3) invariance. It also integrates semantic information of joint axes to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts.

Result: PPF-Tracker demonstrates strong generalization across synthetic and real datasets, robust multi-frame pose tracking in challenging environments, and improved effectiveness over baselines as reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: This approach advances robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality by providing a principled, invariant, and constraint-consistent framework for articulated-object pose tracking; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

TL;DR: Proposes a principled LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration framework for circular targets with two innovations: (1) a robust 3D circle center estimator using conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; (2) a chord-length variance minimization to recover the true 2D projected center, disambiguated via homography validation or quasi-RANSAC. Demonstrates improved accuracy on synthetic and real data, including natural circular objects, with code forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D-2D circle center correspondence is hard due to decoupled 3D circle fitting and 2D ellipse-center estimation, leading to errors in extrinsic calibration; existing methods often fail under diverse targets and sensor configurations.

Method: Two-step geometry-based approach: (i) derive the 3D circle center using conformal geometric algebra (CGA) representations and RANSAC to robustly fit circles to 3D lidar observations; (ii) recover the 2D projected center by minimizing chord-length variance of the projected circle, resolving dual-minima ambiguity with either homography validation or a fallback quasi-RANSAC procedure.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, reducing extrinsic estimation error and enabling robust calibration across varied sensors and circular targets, including natural circular objects.

Conclusion: Provides a geometrically principled, robust calibration framework with publicly release code, broadening applicability to diverse circular targets and improving 3D-2D correspondences in extrinsic calibration.

Abstract: Circular targets are widely used in LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration due to their geometric consistency and ease of detection. However, achieving accurate 3D-2D circular center correspondence remains challenging. Existing methods often fail due to decoupled 3D fitting and erroneous 2D ellipse-center estimation. To address this, we propose a geometrically principled framework featuring two innovations: (i) a robust 3D circle center estimator based on conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; and (ii) a chord-length variance minimization method to recover the true 2D projected center, resolving its dual-minima ambi- guity via homography validation or a quasi-RANSAC fallback. Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It reduces extrinsic estimation error and enables robust calibration across diverse sensors and target types, including natural circular objects. Our code will be publicly released for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MALeR improves layout-guided text-to-image generation by preventing subjects from leaving given layouts and by using a masked, attribute-aware binding to avoid attribute leakage, yielding better compositional accuracy and multi-attribute rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout-guided generation struggles with subjects appearing outside layouts, distribution shifts, and attribute bleed in complex scenes with multiple subjects and attributes.

Method: MALeR introduces (i) layout-constrained generation to keep subjects inside specified layouts and in-distribution, and (ii) a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism to prevent attribute leakage across subjects in compositional scenes.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show superior compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to prior work, especially for scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

Conclusion: MALeR effectively addresses key challenges in compositional, layout-guided image generation and outperforms previous methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled a new era of creative and controllable image generation. However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoNav is an RGB-only, mapless zero-shot object navigation system that adds panoramic scene parsing and a dynamic bounded memory queue to improve decision-making, achieving superior SR and SPL on a public benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot object navigation in unseen environments is hard without depth or prebuilt maps. Mapless approaches often lack historical context, causing local deadlocks. A fully RGB-only method that leverages panoramic perception and memory can unlock better spatial reasoning.

Method: Introduce Panoramic Scene Parsing to extract spatial semantics from panoramic RGB inputs for MLLMs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making module with a Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to include exploration history and mitigate deadlocks in mapless ZSON.

Result: On a public navigation benchmark, PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both Success Rate (SR) and SPL (Trajectory Efficiency).

Conclusion: PanoNav demonstrates that combining panoramic RGB-based spatial parsing with memory-aware decision-making can effectively enhance mapless ZSON, leveraging MLLMs without depth or maps.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unseen environments remains a challenging problem for household robots, requiring strong perceptual understanding and decision-making capabilities. While recent methods leverage metric maps and Large Language Models (LLMs), they often depend on depth sensors or prebuilt maps, limiting the spatial reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Mapless ZSON approaches have emerged to address this, but they typically make short-sighted decisions, leading to local deadlocks due to a lack of historical context. We propose PanoNav, a fully RGB-only, mapless ZSON framework that integrates a Panoramic Scene Parsing module to unlock the spatial parsing potential of MLLMs from panoramic RGB inputs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making mechanism enhanced by a Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to incorporate exploration history and avoid local deadlocks. Experiments on the public navigation benchmark show that PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both SR and SPL metrics.

### [66] [How Reasoning Influences Intersectional Biases in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06005)
*Adit Desai,Sudipta Roy,Mohna Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs exhibit biased reasoning when predicting occupations from faces, revealing intersectional disparities; such reasoning diverges from human value-aligned thinking and persists across models, prompts, and data, underscoring the need for alignment before deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data biases in Vision-Language Models propagate into their reasoning processes, and how this affects fairness and downstream performance in socially sensitive tasks like occupation prediction.

Method: Analyze five open-source VLMs on the FairFace dataset across 32 occupations and three prompting styles. For each instance, collect both the model’s prediction and its reasoning (chain-of-thought style) to assess how biases manifest in the reasoning process.

Result: Biased reasoning patterns systematically underpin intersectional disparities across models, occupations, and prompts. The reasoning diverges from human-valued interpretations, indicating that VLMs can perpetuate harmful social biases even when predictions seem reasonable.

Conclusion: To ensure safe and fair deployment, there is a critical need to align VLM reasoning with human values or implement robust bias-mitigation and alignment strategies before downstream use.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed across downstream tasks, yet their training data often encode social biases that surface in outputs. Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.

### [67] [Aerial Image Stitching Using IMU Data from a UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06841)
*Selim Ahmet Iz,Mustafa Unel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A UAV image-stitching method that fuses IMU data with computer vision to estimate motion, correct distortions, and compute a robust homography, yielding improved stitching accuracy and reliability over feature-based methods in challenging UAV scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-based stitching struggles with detection/matching errors and perspective distortions in UAV imagery; incorporating inertial measurements can provide robust motion estimates and improve alignment in large displacements and pose variations.

Method: Integrate IMU-derived displacement and rotation estimates between consecutive frames with vision-based steps to correct perspective distortion and compute a homography, followed by a standard image-stitching pipeline to align and blend images. The approach aims to be easily integrable into existing UAV workflows.

Result: Experiments show the proposed IMU-assisted approach yields higher accuracy and reliability than some existing feature-based stitching methods, particularly under large displacements, rotations, and camera pose variations.

Conclusion: Leveraging IMU data within the image-stitching pipeline enhances robustness and can be readily integrated into UAV workflows for more reliable large-area stitching.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.

### [68] [Distributed Deep Learning for Medical Image Denoising with Data Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06006)
*Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Ayaz H. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Net++ generally outperforms U-Net in denoising chest X-ray images under various noise levels, with competitive PSNR/SSIM and better structural fidelity, while optimized distributed training delivers large speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy/efficiency concerns in medical imaging by denoising noisy images on large-scale datasets using lightweight obfuscation, and evaluate architectural choices (U-Net vs U-Net++) and distributed training strategies (single-GPU, DataParallel, DDP with AMP).

Method: Dataset: NIH Chest X-ray14; noise: additive Gaussian; models: U-Net and U-Net++; training setups: single-GPU, standard DataParallel, and DistributedDataParallel with Automatic Mixed Precision; evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS; compare training time and accuracy; public implementation at: https://github.com/Suadey/medical-image-denoising-ddp.

Result: U-Net++ delivers superior denoising quality in terms of PSNR and SSIM across noise levels, while LPIPS lags behind U-Net at low to moderate noise (indicating slightly lower perceptual similarity). Optimized distributed training reduces training time by >60% versus single-GPU for both models and beats standard DataParallel by >40%, with only a minor drop in accuracy. The study demonstrates that software-level optimization in distributed learning can meaningfully accelerate medical imaging pipelines without sacrificing too much performance, enabling practical deployment with architectural and obfuscation strategies.

Conclusion: Combining architectural design (U-Net++), lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training (DDP + AMP) is viable for fast, accurate medical image denoising on large datasets, offering tangible speedups and robust denoising performance; implementation is publicly available for real-world adoption.

Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving image quality while minimizing the exposure of sensitive information, particularly when working with large-scale clinical datasets. This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments. The full implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Suadey/medical-image-denoising-ddp.

### [69] [Real-Time LiDAR Super-Resolution via Frequency-Aware Multi-Scale Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07377)
*June Moh Goo,Zichao Zeng,Jan Boehm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLASH is a dual-domain LiDAR super-resolution framework that combines frequency-aware window attention with adaptive multi-scale fusion to achieve state-of-the-art results on KITTI using a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LiDAR super-resolution by capturing both fine-grained geometry and global scanning patterns without relying on computationally expensive stochastic inference or purely spatial-domain methods.

Method: Two innovations: (1) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that blends local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT for log-linear complexity; (2) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion with learned, position-specific feature aggregation and CBAM-based dynamic feature selection, enabling multi-scale, dual-domain fusion without traditional skip connections.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI across evaluation metrics, surpassing uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes; outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, enabling real-time deployment.

Conclusion: Dual-domain processing effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than stochastic inference, making FLASH practical for autonomous LiDAR perception.

Abstract: LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.

### [70] [One-Shot Knowledge Transfer for Scalable Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06016)
*Longhua Li,Lei Qi,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer) consolidates a teacher's knowledge into a weight chain to enable expansion to any target model size without extra computation, outperforming existing compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge ReID requires lightweight models to reduce cloud load and protect privacy. Conventional compression needs separate training for each target model, which is inefficient when multiple sizes are needed.

Method: Knowledge is transferred once into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain (the teacher’s knowledge). When a downstream scenario requires a model of a certain size, the weight chain is expanded to that size without additional computations.

Result: OSKT outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods and offers a one-time transfer, eliminating the need for repeated computations for each target model.

Conclusion: OSKT enables efficient, scalable deployment of ReID models on edge devices by enabling size-flexible models with no extra downstream computation.

Abstract: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TwinOR creates photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of operating rooms to safely develop embodied AI. It reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos, models dynamic motion via multi-view sensing, and fuses everything into an immersive 3D environment for controllable simulation and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe, controllable environments are needed for continual learning and evaluation of embodied AI in ORs, but real-world ORs impose safety and regulatory constraints that limit unrestricted perception and interaction. Digital twins offer high-fidelity, risk-free platforms for exploration and benchmarking.

Method: Reconstruct static OR geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously model human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. Fuse static and dynamic components into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration.

Result: Achieves centimeter-level geometry accuracy and preserves dynamic interactions across surgical workflows. Enables realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI. On TwinOR-synthesized data, perception systems like FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 perform comparably to their performance on real indoor datasets, indicating sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a real-to-sim pipeline for dynamic, photorealistic OR digital twins, enabling safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI and accelerating sim-to-real deployment.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems requires safe, controllable environments for continual learning and evaluation. However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.

*Priyansh Srivastava,Romit Chatterjee,Abir Sen,Aradhana Behura,Ratnakar Dash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiVID: a lightweight, self-supervised diffusion-based video frame interpolation (VFI) framework that avoids explicit motion estimation by using a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention and a hybrid masking regime; trained on CPU with 9-frame segments, achieving competitive results after 50 epochs on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion in VFI while reducing reliance on dense ground-truth and expensive optical-flow methods. Propose a scalable, low-resource, self-supervised approach using diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis.

Method: A 3D U-Net backbone augmented with transformer-style temporal attention. Diffusion-based frame synthesis guided by a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. Cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling enable robust spatiotemporal representation learning without high-frame-rate supervision. Trained end-to-end on CPU using 9-frame video segments.

Result: MiVID achieves optimal results at 50 epochs and is competitive with several supervised baselines on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7, demonstrating strong performance under self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis.

Conclusion: This work establishes MiVID as a scalable, accessible VFI system that leverages self-supervised diffusion priors to achieve temporally coherent frame interpolation, enabling generalizable VFI with reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

### [73] [Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024)
*Feng Lu,Tong Jin,Canming Ye,Yunpeng Liu,Xiangyuan Lan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based VPR approach that uses learnable aggregation tokens inserted into the patch token sequence to implicitly aggregate features, eliminating the need for a separate aggregator; achieves state-of-the-art performance including MSLS, with improved efficiency; provides token insertion and initialization strategies; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm dominates visual place recognition (VPR); however, in the transformer era, explicit aggregators may be redundant. The goal is to obtain robust global descriptors using only the backbone by introducing learnable aggregation tokens, and to study where/how to insert them and how to initialize them to maximize performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduce learnable aggregation tokens prepended to patch tokens before a transformer block. All tokens interact via self-attention, implicitly aggregating information into the aggregation tokens. The global descriptor is formed by concatenating the aggregation tokens from the last output. The paper also proposes an optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple VPR datasets, with higher efficiency, and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard. Code is provided at the authors' repository.

Conclusion: Dedicated aggregators are unnecessary in the transformer era; robust global descriptors can be obtained using a backbone with learnable aggregation tokens. The insertion strategy and initialization are crucial. The approach yields superior accuracy and efficiency for VPR, validated on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard. The code is available at https://github.com/lu-feng/image.

*Zihui Zhao,Yifei Zhang,Zheng Wang,Yang Li,Kui Jiang,Zihan Geng,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatio-spectral mutual learning framework (S2ML) for depth completion that fuses spatial and frequency-domain features, accounting for amplitude and phase spectra, achieving state-of-the-art gains over CFormer on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw depth images from TOF/structured light often have missing values due to weak reflections, shadows, and artifacts. Existing image-domain depth completion methods ignore the physical characteristics and frequency distribution of raw depth, which can be altered by invalid regions. This work seeks to leverage both spatial and spectral priors to improve depth completion.

Method: Propose Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning (S2ML) framework. It includes a dedicated spectral fusion module that treats amplitude and phase spectra distinctly, and computes local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features in a unified embedding space. The model uses gradual mutual representation and refinement to enable cross-domain learning and improved depth completion.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms the state-of-the-art CFormer by 0.828 dB on NYU-Depth V2 and by 0.834 dB on SUN RGB-D.

Conclusion: S2ML effectively harnesses spatio-spectral priors and mutual learning to enhance depth completion for raw depth images, demonstrating notable improvements and highlighting the importance of considering spectral characteristics in depth completion tasks.

Abstract: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

*Zhihui Ke,Yuyang Liu,Xiaobo Zhou,Tie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamSTGS enables real-time streaming of free-viewpoint video by representing dynamic scenes with canonical 3D Gaussians, per-frame 2D encodings, and a deformation field; it achieves high compression (~170 KB/frame) while maintaining competitive quality (≈1 dB PSNR gain) and supports adaptive bitrate without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time streaming FVV is hindered by heavy storage and bandwidth requirements of 3D Gaussian Splatting methods (up to ~10 MB/frame). There is a need for an efficient representation and training-free adaptive streaming to handle network variability while preserving visual fidelity.

Method: Represent dynamic scenes using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. Encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video for high compression. Introduce a sliding window to aggregate local temporal features for local motion and a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. The design supports adaptive bitrate by network conditions without extra training.

Result: On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS is competitive across metrics, improves PSNR by ~1 dB on average, and reduces per-frame size to ~170 KB, enabling real-time streaming. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: StreamSTGS offers a practical, high-compression, real-time streaming solution for FVV by combining latent 3D Gaussian representations with temporally-encoded features and a deformation field, along with motion-learning mechanisms and adaptive bitrate capability.

Abstract: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mobile-optimized text-to-video system (Neodragon) that runs 49-frame videos on-device in 6.7s on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU, using distillation, pruning, and efficient decoding to achieve high-fidelity video with ~4.95B params and 3.5GB peak RAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable private, low-latency text-to-video generation on mobile devices, addressing cloud dependency, data privacy, bandwidth costs, and hardware constraints of mobile platforms.

Method: Four technical contributions: (1) Text-Encoder Distillation replacing 4.762B T5xL with 0.2B DistilT5; (2) Asymmetric Decoder Distillation to substitute the native codec-latent-VAE decoder while preserving latent space; (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks with a two-stage distillation to recover performance; (4) Reducing Neural Functional Evaluations via step distillation with DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching. End-to-end pipeline includes an optimized SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet 2x upscaling; total ~4.945B parameters, 3.5GB peak RAM, 6.7s end-to-end latency, 81.61 VBench."

Result: Demonstrates that mobile hardware can support efficient, high-fidelity text-to-video generation with end-to-end latency of 6.7s for a 2-second video (49 frames @24fps) at 640x1024, using a compact model and targeted distillation/pruning strategies; achieves on-device private T2V without cloud services; VBench score 81.61.

Conclusion: The work shows the feasibility of on-device T2V on mobile hardware with strong efficiency gains and privacy benefits. It hinges on specialized hardware (Hexagon NPU) and tailored distillation/pruning techniques; public release of code/models will help validate generalizability and enable broader adoption, but device dependence and energy consumption considerations remain areas for further study.

Abstract: We introduce Neodragon, a text-to-video system capable of generating 2s (49 frames @24 fps) videos at the 640x1024 resolution directly on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU in a record 6.7s (7 FPS). Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

### [77] [LoopExpose: An Unsupervised Framework for Arbitrary-Length Exposure Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06066)
*Ao Li,Chen Chen,Zhenyu Wang,Tao Huang,Fangfang Wu,Weisheng Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoopExpose is an unsupervised exposure correction framework that uses pseudo-labels and a two-level nested optimization with a feedback loop and a luminance ranking loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labels for exposure correction are scarce; there is a need for robust, generalizable exposure correction under challenging lighting without large labeled datasets.

Method: A two-level loop: upper level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated by a lower-level multi-exposure fusion module; corrected images feed back to refine pseudo-labels; incorporates a Luminance Ranking Loss to exploit relative luminance order across the input sequence.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show LoopExpose outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in both exposure correction and fusion performance; code is available online.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that self-reinforcing unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels and luminance-based self-supervision can achieve strong exposure correction without labeled data, suggesting broader applicability to unsupervised image enhancement.

Abstract: Exposure correction is essential for enhancing image quality under challenging lighting conditions. While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

*Umar Rashid,Muhammad Arslan Arshad,Ghulam Ahmad,Muhammad Zeeshan Anjum,Rizwan Khan,Muhammad Akmal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-Transformer hybrid for motion-blur scene text restoration; achieves PSNR 32.20 dB and SSIM 0.934 with 2.83M params and 61 ms inference, trained on synthetic blurred samples derived from TextOCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur severely degrades scene-text readability and hinders CV tasks. Spatially varying blur and the need to model long-range dependencies challenge traditional deblurring; a hybrid CNN-ViT aims to capture both local details and global context.

Method: CNN-based encoder-decoder preserves structural details; a transformer module provides global awareness via self-attention. Training on a TextOCR-derived dataset with synthetic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes/orientations. Loss combines MAE, MSE, perceptual loss, and SSIM. Model has 2.83M parameters and ~61 ms average inference time.

Result: PSNR 32.20 dB and SSIM 0.934 achieved on evaluated benchmarks; model is lightweight and efficient, suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: The CNN-ViT hybrid design effectively restores motion-blurred scene text while remaining computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world deployment and downstream tasks in CV pipelines.

Abstract: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

### [80] [Efficient Online Continual Learning in Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05566)
*Yao Zhang,Souza Leite Clayton,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTRN-HAR applies pre-trained model-based online continual learning to sensor-based HAR by pre-training a contrastive-feature extractor on limited data, freezing it during streaming, and using a relation module for classification, achieving higher data efficiency and lower resource usage while outperforming state-of-the-art on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for post-deployment adaptation in sensor-based HAR. Existing online continual learning (OCL) methods are computationally heavy and data-hungry. PTM-based OCL has shown promise in vision, but HAR poses challenges due to dataset heterogeneity and limited labeled data after deployment. PTRN-HAR aims to address these gaps.

Method: Pre-train a feature extractor with contrastive loss using a limited dataset and freeze this extractor during the streaming/continual learning phase. Replace the conventional dense classifier with a relation module network to perform classification.

Result: Experiments on three public HAR datasets show that PTRN-HAR outperforms state-of-the-art OCL methods while significantly reducing resource consumption and improving data efficiency; code is provided at the cited link.

Conclusion: PTRN-HAR demonstrates the viability of PTM-based OCL for sensor-based HAR with reduced data and computational requirements and strong performance, pointing to broader applicability and potential future improvements in data efficiency and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning models for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) are expected to adapt post-deployment to recognize new activities and different ways of performing existing ones. To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: A simple, unsupervised disentangled representation for grouped deforming 3D objects can drive effective downstream tasks with efficient inference, demonstrating the value of disentangled latent optimization and PoinNet-based encoders.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a disentangled latent optimization-based method for parameterizing grouped deforming 3D objects into shape and deformation factors in an unsupervised manner. Our approach involves the joint optimization of a generator network along with the shape and deformation factors, supported by specific regularization techniques. For efficient amortized inference of disentangled shape and deformation codes, we train two order-invariant PoinNet-based encoder networks in the second stage of our method. We demonstrate several significant downstream applications of our method, including unsupervised deformation transfer, deformation classification, and explainability analysis. Extensive experiments conducted on 3D human, animal, and facial expression datasets demonstrate that our simple approach is highly effective in these downstream tasks, comparable or superior to existing methods with much higher complexity.

*Hossein Askari,Yadan Luo,Hongfu Sun,Fred Roosta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFlow proposes a training-free, latent-space flow-based framework for linear inverse problems that leverages pretrained latent flow priors and flow matching to perform ODE sampling, with a theoretically grounded posterior covariance for guidance, achieving superior reconstruction quality to state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-based inverse solvers operate in pixel space, which is computationally heavy and scales poorly to high-resolution images, and they use guidance with prior-agnostic posterior covariances that can misalign with the generative trajectory and harm posterior coverage. A latent-space approach with principled covariance guidance is desirable for efficiency, scalability, and better-calibrated posteriors.

Method: LFlow is a training-free framework that uses pretrained latent flow priors and flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. It introduces a theoretically grounded posterior covariance derived from the optimal vector field to enable effective flow guidance for linear inverse problems.

Result: Experimental results show that LFlow outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality on most tasks.

Conclusion: LFlow provides an efficient, training-free solution for linear inverse problems by leveraging latent flow priors and a principled posterior covariance to guide latent-space flows, achieving high-quality reconstructions; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in inverse problem solving have increasingly adopted flow priors over diffusion models due to their ability to construct straight probability paths from noise to data, thereby enhancing efficiency in both training and inference. However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks.

### [83] [Real-Time Bundle Adjustment for Ultra-High-Resolution UAV Imagery Using Adaptive Patch-Based Feature Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06152)
*Selim Ahmet Iz,Francesco Nex,Norman Kerle,Henry Meissner,Ralf Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time, full-resolution UAV bundle adjustment using a patch-based, onboard framework that tracks image patches with GNSS/IMU and a coarse DSM, enabling localized BA on overlapping image clusters in under 2 seconds for 50MP data without downsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide rapid, high-fidelity geospatial information for time-critical missions (e.g., disaster response) where traditional BA is too slow or degrades detail due to downsampling.

Method: Divide each image into patches (e.g., 150x150 px). Track patches across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse DSM to maintain spatial consistency for feature extraction and matching. Determine real-time overlaps between images via navigation data, select a sliding cluster of overlapping images (including adjacent flight strips), and perform localized BA. Integrates with DLR MACS for real-time, onboard large-area mapping.

Result: Validated on MACS datasets with 50MP imagery: preserves camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, achieving full BA in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasible real-time, full-resolution BA on UAV data by combining patch-based tracking, real-time overlap determination, and sliding-cluster BA, enabling seamless large-area mapping for emergency response and other urgent applications.

Abstract: Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

TL;DR: Introduces the Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and MambaOVSR network for space-time opera video super-resolution. The model uses Global Fusion Module (GFM), Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM), and MambaVR to handle large opera motions; achieves +1.86 dB PSNR over the previous SOTA on COVC; dataset and code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opera footage suffers from low frame rates and resolution due to early filming constraints, hindering archival efforts. There is a scarcity of opera-specific STVSR data, and existing methods lack global motion modeling needed for large, fast motions in opera performances.

Method: Proposes three components: Global Fusion Module (GFM) with multiscale alternating scanning for robust motion modeling; Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across sequences of different lengths; MambaVR block to mitigate feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment.

Result: On the COVC dataset, MambaOVSR outperforms state-of-the-art STVSR methods by an average of 1.86 dB PSNR.

Conclusion: Contributes a large-scale opera-focused dataset and a novel STVSR architecture tailored for opera with superior reconstruction quality, and commits to releasing dataset and code to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Chinese opera is celebrated for preserving classical art. However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: Editable, high-fidelity 3D CAD from natural language is difficult; existing text-to-CAD methods produce meshes or lack design-history data; NURBGen targets direct NURBS-based generation for precise engineering models.

Method: Fine-tune a large language model to translate free-form text into JSON containing NURBS surface parameters (control points, knot vectors, degrees, rational weights) and convert to BRep via Python; introduce a hybrid representation combining untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to robustly handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions while reducing token complexity; create partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset with CAD components and automated captions; evaluate on diverse prompts.

Result: NURBGen shows strong performance on diverse prompts and surpasses prior methods in geometric fidelity and dimensional accuracy, according to expert evaluations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of high-fidelity text-to-NURBS CAD generation and provides a dataset and pipeline for future research; code and data will be released publicly.

Abstract: Generating editable 3D CAD models from natural language remains challenging, as existing text-to-CAD systems either produce meshes or rely on scarce design-history data. We present NURBGen, the first framework to generate high-fidelity 3D CAD models directly from text using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline. NURBGen demonstrates strong performance on diverse prompts, surpassing prior methods in geometric fidelity and dimensional accuracy, as confirmed by expert evaluations.

Motivation: Democratize urban design by grounding decisions in everyday patterns and lived experience, moving beyond top-down master planning, and enabling continuous local participation through AI-assisted, interpretable design suggestions.

Method: 1) Detect urban objects with Grounding DINO using a curated ADE20K subset as proxy for the urban built environment. 2) Build co-occurrence embeddings to reveal common spatial configurations. 3) Provide the user with five statistically likely complements to a chosen anchor object. 4) Use a vision-language model to reason over the scene and selected pair to propose a third object that completes a more complex urban tactic. 5) Maintain human control over selection and refinement.

Result: The framework yields five complementary objects for an anchor and a third-object suggestion, enabling iterative, user-guided proposals for micro-scale interventions and illustrating a workflow that integrates detection, embedding analysis, and multimodal reasoning to surface design options grounded in observed patterns.

Conclusion: The approach targets a shift from top-down planning toward designs grounded in everyday spatial patterns and lived experience, empowering local participation by providing AI-assisted, interpretable recommendations while keeping users in control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a human-in-the-loop computer vision framework that uses generative AI to propose micro-scale design interventions in public space and support more continuous, local participation. Using Grounding DINO and a curated subset of the ADE20K dataset as a proxy for the urban built environment, the system detects urban objects and builds co-occurrence embeddings that reveal common spatial configurations. From this analysis, the user receives five statistically likely complements to a chosen anchor object. A vision language model then reasons over the scene image and the selected pair to suggest a third object that completes a more complex urban tactic.

*Shu Zhao,Nilesh Ahuja,Tan Yu,Tianyi Shen,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for vision-language models that handles missing modalities by sharing modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders while preserving modality-specific adapters; it improves missing-modality performance, reduces inference time, and uses negligible trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world settings modalities may be missing due to privacy, collection difficulties, or resource constraints; prior prompt-based methods fail to capture cross-modal relationships and add overhead.

Method: MoRA introduces modality-common parameters to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between text and vision encoders, coupled with modality-specific parameters, enabling inter-modality interaction and intra-modality flexibility during fine-tuning.

Result: On standard benchmarks, MoRA yields an average missing-modality performance improvement of 5.24%, requires only 25.90% of SOTA inference time, and uses 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MoRA provides a scalable, efficient solution for multimodal recognition under missing modalities by combining cross-modal sharing with modality-specific adaptations, achieving strong performance with low training and inference overhead.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models have shown remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks, but they typically assume the availability of complete multimodal inputs during both training and inference. In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning, enabling effective transfer of pretrained representations to asynchronous event data; code is released for replication.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for vision tasks in challenging environments, yet processing asynchronous event streams remains an open challenge. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively. Overall, this work unlocks the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaRho/TGVFM.

### [89] [Physics-Informed Image Restoration via Progressive PDE Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06244)
*Shamika Likhite,Santiago López-Tapia,Aggelos K. Katsaggelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed, PDE-based global-layer approach to motion deblurring that augments state-of-the-art restoration networks with advection-diffusion dynamics, enabling long-range spatial modeling with ~1% GMAC overhead and consistent PSNR/SSIM gains across FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional models struggle to capture long-range spatial dependencies in motion blur due to limited receptive fields; motion blur exhibits directional flow that can be modeled by physical priors (PDEs). Integrating physics-informed dynamics can guide feature evolution and improve restoration with minimal overhead.

Method: Introduce a progressive training framework that embeds physics-informed PDE layers (advection-diffusion dynamics) into existing restoration architectures, enabling global spatial modeling of blur patterns. Train progressively to leverage PDE priors while preserving original network strengths; evaluate on standard motion deblurring benchmarks across FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer.

Result: PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with about 1% additional GMACs. Across four architectures, they yield consistent improvements in perceptual quality (PSNR/SSIM) on standard motion deblurring benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating mathematical physics via PDE-based global layers is a promising direction for physics-informed neural networks in image restoration, enabling efficient modeling of long-range blur patterns and improving perceptual quality without substantial computational overhead.

Abstract: Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.

### [90] [Gait Recognition via Collaborating Discriminative and Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06245)
*Haijun Xiong,Bin Feng,Bang Wang,Xinggang Wang,Wenyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoD^2 is a diffusion-discriminative hybrid framework for gait recognition that uses multi-level conditional control to generate identity-consistent gait sequences and improve discriminative feature learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminative gait models perform well but may miss data distribution aspects; diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities to model appearance, motion, and identity distribution. A hybrid approach can leverage generation to strengthen robust, high-level semantic gait representations.

Method: CoD^2 combines diffusion-based data distribution modeling with discriminative representation learning through a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy. High-level identity-aware semantics, inferred by a discriminative extractor, condition the diffusion generator to produce identity-consistent gait sequences, while low-level visual details (appearance and motion) are preserved. The generated sequences are then used to train/enhance the discriminative extractor, enabling it to capture richer high-level semantics.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, Gait3D) shows state-of-the-art performance and consistent improvements when integrated with existing discriminative methods.

Conclusion: A diffusion–discriminative hybrid with multi-level conditioning yields robust gait representations and strong, dataset-wide performance gains, and can be readily integrated into existing gait recognition pipelines.

Abstract: Gait recognition offers a non-intrusive biometric solution by identifying individuals through their walking patterns. Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.

TL;DR: AdaDrive adaptively integrates LLMs into autonomous driving via adaptive activation and adaptive fusion, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance high-level LLM reasoning with real-time constraints; existing approaches either overuse LLMs or rely on fixed schedules.

Method: Two components: (1) Adaptive activation loss using comparative learning to decide when to invoke LLMs in complex/critical scenes; (2) Adaptive fusion that produces a continuous scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, enabling seamless collaboration with standard planners.

Result: Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks show state-of-the-art driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: AdaDrive provides a context-aware, flexible framework that maximizes decision accuracy while preserving real-time performance; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Effectively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving requires a balance between leveraging high-level reasoning and maintaining real-time efficiency. Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance. Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that AdaDrive state-of-the-art performance in terms of both driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLDrive presents a lightweight multimodal driving model that uses cycle-consistent dynamic visual pruning, memory-enhanced feature aggregation, and distance-decoupled instruction attention to improve visual-linguistic learning, achieving state-of-the-art CARLA performance with an 81% parameter reduction (7B to 1.3B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous driving systems struggle due to (a) failures from limited visual representations leading to collisions/obstructions, and (b) deployment hurdles caused by large LLM parameter counts.

Method: Introduce VLDrive, a compact multimodal LLM (MLLM) architecture with enhanced vision modules. Key components include cycle-consistent dynamic visual pruning to produce compact visual tokens, memory-enhanced feature aggregation to retain salient information, and a distance-decoupled instruction attention mechanism to improve learning for long-range visual tokens.

Result: In CARLA, VLDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving performance and reduces parameters by 81% (from 7B to 1.3B). It yields driving score improvements of 15.4% (tiny distance), 16.8% (short distance), and 7.6% (long distance) in closed-loop evaluation.

Conclusion: VLDrive demonstrates that a compact MLLM with smarter vision components can surpass larger models in autonomous driving while being far more deployment-friendly; the approach is validated in simulation and complemented by an available codebase.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language-grounded autonomous driving have been significantly promoted by the sophisticated cognition and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current LLM-based approaches encounter critical challenges: (1) Failure analysis reveals that frequent collisions and obstructions, stemming from limitations in visual representations, remain primary obstacles to robust driving performance. (2) The substantial parameters of LLMs pose considerable deployment hurdles. To address these limitations, we introduce VLDrive, a novel approach featuring a lightweight MLLM architecture with enhanced vision components. VLDrive achieves compact visual tokens through innovative strategies, including cycle-consistent dynamic visual pruning and memory-enhanced feature aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a distance-decoupled instruction attention mechanism to improve joint visual-linguistic feature learning, particularly for long-range visual tokens. Extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate VLDrive`s effectiveness. Notably, VLDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing parameters by 81% (from 7B to 1.3B), yielding substantial driving score improvements of 15.4%, 16.8%, and 7.6% at tiny, short, and long distances, respectively, in closed-loop evaluations.

### [93] [Robust Nearest Neighbour Retrieval Using Targeted Manifold Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06261)
*B. Ghosh,H. Harikumar,S. Rana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A targeted-manifold backdooring strategy reframes nearest-neighbour retrieval as a perturbation-readiness task: a lightweight input patch causes near neighbours to be classified as a dummy class, enabling confidence-based ranking that surpasses traditional distance metrics under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robust and semantically meaningful nearest-neighbour retrieval in classification and explainable-AI pipelines by moving away from hand-tuned feature distances toward a task-specific perturbation-based notion of neighborhood.

Method: Introduce Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN). For each query, apply a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch and softly backdoor the network so inputs containing the patch are steered to a dummy class. Similar inputs require only a small perturbation to be classified as the dummy class, while dissimilar ones are less affected. Rank candidates by the model's confidence in the dummy class to obtain neighbours.

Result: The trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional distance metrics under noise and across diverse tasks, with robustness analyses and benchmark experiments supporting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Task-specific perturbation confidence can serve as a robust and semantically meaningful basis for nearest-neighbour retrieval, potentially improving explainability and performance over conventional metric-based approaches, though it relies on a controlled perturbation mechanism (a backdoored model) and may raise practical and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Nearest-neighbour retrieval is central to classification and explainable-AI pipelines, but current practice relies on hand-tuning feature layers and distance metrics. We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular, four-component framework uses quantile-based patch selection, graph-guided clustering, hierarchical context attention, and a expert-driven mixture of log-logistic distributions to predict cancer-specific survival from whole slide images, achieving competitive C-indices across TCGA cancers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survival prediction from whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) is hindered by tissue heterogeneity, spatial structure, and diverse survival distributions. A modular approach aiming to select prognostic regions, model phenotype-level heterogeneity, capture intra/inter-cluster interactions, and flexibly estimate survival distributions is proposed to improve predictive performance.

Method: 1) Quantile Gated Patch Selection via quantile thresholding to isolate prognostically informative tissue regions; 2) Graph Guided Clustering using a k-NN graph to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence; 3) Hierarchical Context Attention to learn intra- and inter-cluster interactions; 4) Expert Driven Mixture of Log-logistic distributions to estimate complex survival distributions.

Result: Concordance indices: 0.644 on TCGA LUAD, 0.751 on TCGA KIRC, and 0.752 on TCGA BRCA, reportedly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework effectively captures tissue heterogeneity and spatial interactions in WSIs, yielding competitive survival predictions across multiple TCGA cancer cohorts and highlighting the value of combining region selection, graph-based clustering, hierarchical attention, and flexible survival distribution modeling.

Abstract: We propose a modular framework for predicting cancer specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs). The method integrates four components: (i) Quantile Gated Patch Selection via quantile based thresholding to isolate prognostically informative tissue regions; (ii) Graph Guided Clustering using a k nearest neighbor graph to capture phenotype level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence; (iii) Hierarchical Context Attention to learn intra and inter cluster interactions; and (iv) an Expert Driven Mixture of Log logistics framework to estimate complex survival distributions using Log logistics distributions. The model attains a concordance index of 0.644 on TCGA LUAD, 0.751 on TCGA KIRC, and 0.752 on TCGA BRCA respectively, outperforming existing state of the art approaches.

*Jian Zhang,Junyi Guo,Junyi Yuan,Huanda Lu,Yanlin Zhou,Fangyu Wu,Qiufeng Wang,Dongming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C^3 enhances cross-modal retrieval by making LLM-generated descriptions more complete and consistent via a completeness evaluator and a supervised MD-guided reasoning process, achieving state-of-the-art results on cultural heritage and general benchmarks in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval suffers from incomplete/descriptions due to data loss and annotation cost; LLMs can enrich text but hallucinate and miss grounded details; need mechanisms to assess and enforce completeness and factual consistency.

Method: Introduce completeness evaluation module using visual cues and LLM outputs to measure semantic coverage; formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise the chain-of-thought reasoning and control queries adaptively to maintain consistency; integrates into a data augmentation framework for improved cross-modal retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CulTi, TimeTravel, MSCOCO, and Flickr30K, in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: C^3 effectively mitigates hallucinations and inconsistencies in LLM-generated descriptions, boosting cross-modal retrieval by ensuring both completeness and consistency.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is essential for interpreting cultural heritage data, but its effectiveness is often limited by incomplete or inconsistent textual descriptions, caused by historical data loss and the high cost of expert annotation. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelightMaster enables controllable video relighting in diffusion models using a new RelightVideo dataset, a Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI) visual prompt, and a Light Image Adapter that injects lighting features into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers to produce plausible lighting without forgetting content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models struggle with fine-grained lighting control; lighting prompts are insufficient and real-world relighting data is scarce, hindering accurate relighting and shadow rendering.

Method: Develop RelightVideo (identical content under varying lighting via Unreal Engine); introduce MPLI with depth-aligned planes representing lighting; create Light Image Adapter that compresses MPLI with a Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks to adapt existing models without catastrophic forgetting; supports multi-source lighting and unseen setups.

Result: RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows while preserving original scene content; demonstrates controllable relighting capabilities; demos are provided.

Conclusion: A data- and model-efficient framework for accurate, controllable video relighting that leverages a specialized lighting prompt (MPLI) and a lightweight adapter to repurpose pre-trained diffusion models for lighting manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models enable high-quality video generation and editing, but precise relighting with consistent video contents, which is critical for shaping scene atmosphere and viewer attention, remains unexplored. Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/RelightMaster/.

### [97] [LaneDiffusion: Improving Centerline Graph Learning via Prior Injected BEV Feature Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06272)
*Zijie Wang,Weiming Zhang,Wei Zhang,Xiao Tan,Hongxing Liu,Yaowei Wang,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaneDiffusion is a diffusion-based generative framework for learning centerline graphs that operates on BEV features, introducing LPIM and LPDM to produce lane priors, and decoding vectorized centerlines and topologies from the priors. It achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Argoverse2 across multiple fine-grained and segment-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic methods for centerline graph learning often struggle with occlusions, invisibility of centerlines, and limited spatial reasoning. A generative approach can better model priors and uncertainty, enabling robust centerline synthesis under challenging conditions.

Method: The approach uses diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level rather than directly predicting vectorized centerlines. It introduces a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) to construct diffusion targets and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to control the diffusion process. Finally, vectorized centerlines and topologies are decoded from the prior-injected BEV features.

Result: On nuScenes and Argoverse2, LaneDiffusion yields substantial gains across both fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS, SDA) and segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l, TOP_ll), with improvements ranging roughly from 1.8% to 6.8% depending on the metric, surpassing existing methods and setting new state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning.

Conclusion: LaneDiffusion demonstrates that diffusion-based priors over BEV features can effectively drive centerline graph learning, offering improved accuracy and robustness. The work highlights the potential of generative diffusion models for structured geometric tasks in autonomous driving and paves the way for more generative approaches in lane topology estimation.

Abstract: Centerline graphs, crucial for path planning in autonomous driving, are traditionally learned using deterministic methods. However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that LaneDiffusion significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 4.2%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 6.4% and 1.8% on fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS and SDA) and 2.3%, 6.4%, 6.8% and 2.1% on segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l and TOP_ll). These results establish state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning, offering new insights into generative models for this task.

TL;DR: VideoSSR framework uses self-supervised pretext tasks (Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, Temporal Jigsaw) to enable RL-based video understanding in RLVR for Multimodal LLMs. It introduces VIUBench and VideoSSR-30K, reporting consistent >5% average gains across 17 benchmarks in four domains, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data bottleneck in rapidly advancing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for video understanding by leveraging intrinsic information in videos to generate high-quality, verifiable training data without manual annotations.

Method: Introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks (Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, Temporal Jigsaw); construct Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench); assemble VideoSSR-30K; propose VideoSSR, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR; evaluate across 17 benchmarks spanning four domains.

Result: VideoSSR yields an average improvement of over 5% across 17 benchmarks, indicating robust gains; VIUBench demonstrates current SOTA models struggle on the proposed tasks; VideoSSR and VideoSSR-30K provide a scalable, self-supervised pathway for RLVR in MLLMs; code is available.

Conclusion: VideoSSR represents a potent foundational framework for advancing video understanding in MLLMs, enabling more capable video-based reasoning and question answering in RLVR settings; the work validates self-supervised strategies for generating effective verifiable training data and reinforces the role of intrinsic video information in model development.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially advanced the video understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the rapid progress of MLLMs is outpacing the complexity of existing video datasets, while the manual annotation of new, high-quality data remains prohibitively expensive. This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\%. These results establish VideoSSR as a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lcqysl/VideoSSR.

TL;DR: Deep learning (DL) models outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 in adnexal lesion ultrasound; ViT-based model (ViT16-384) achieved the best performance (AUC 0.941, accuracy 87.4%); hybrid human-AI frameworks significantly improved CNN performance, whereas improvements for ViTs were not statistically significant; integrating radiologist scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability and conservative thresholds in O-RADS v2022 and to assess whether DL models and hybrid human-AI systems can improve diagnostic performance in classifying adnexal lesions on ultrasound.

Method: Retrospective single-center study of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 malignant); evaluated 16 DL architectures (DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, ViTs) trained/validated; radiologist O-RADS v2022 assessment used; a hybrid model combined radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities.

Result: Radiologist-only O-RADS AUC 0.683; accuracy 68.0%. CNNs yielded AUCs 0.620–0.908 and accuracies 59.2%–86.4%. ViT16-384 achieved the best single-model performance with AUC 0.941 and accuracy 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks significantly improved CNN performance; improvements for ViTs were not statistically significant (P>0.05).

Conclusion: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022; integrating expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI approaches have strong potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation and reduce false positives while improving detection of high-risk lesions.

Abstract: Background: The 2022 update of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound classification refines risk stratification for adnexal lesions, yet human interpretation remains subject to variability and conservative thresholds. Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.

*Xuanle Zhao,Shuxin Zeng,Yinyuan Cai,Xiang Cheng,Duzhen Zhang,Xiuyi Chen,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyChemVL is a compact (4B params) vision-language model for chemistry that uses visual token reduction to ignore non-informative background, and trains on both molecular and reaction-level tasks. It achieves superior performance with faster inference/training compared to larger baselines (e.g., ChemVLM) while using only 1/16th of the visual tokens. It is complemented by a new reaction-level benchmark, ChemRxn-V, for evaluating vision-based reaction recognition and product prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in chemistry are inefficient due to processing full chemical images with non-informative backgrounds and are limited to molecular-level tasks, hindering chemical reasoning and reaction understanding.

Method: Co-design approach combining model architecture with task complexity: visual token reduction to focus on informative regions (molecular structures) and training on both molecular tasks and reaction-level tasks. Introduction of ChemRxn-V benchmark to assess reaction recognition and reaction-product prediction from images.

Result: With 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks, faster inference and training speeds, and outperforms ChemVLM while using only 1/16th of the visual tokens.

Conclusion: Efficient yet powerful chemical domain VLMs can be built by co-designing model architecture and task scope; token-efficient visual processing and reaction-level tasks enable better chemical reasoning at scale.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general visual understanding, their application in the chemical domain has been limited, with previous works predominantly focusing on text and thus overlooking critical visual information, such as molecular structures. Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.

*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yanjun Wang,Changchun Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Buyu Wang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text is more informative than image for multimodal misinformation detection; RETSIMD augments images from text segments via a text-to-image generator, uses mutual-information objectives, and fuses features with a graph neural network, yielding strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In MMD, textual content generally describes the whole event while images may show only partial scenes. This underutilizes the image modality and motivates leveraging text more effectively by generating vision content aligned with text segments and jointly optimizing cross-modal representations.

Method: Split the input text into segments that describe partial scenes; feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. Introduce auxiliary objectives for text–image mutual information and image–label mutual information. Post-train the generator on an auxiliary text-to-image benchmark. Build a graph with three heuristic relationships among images and apply a graph neural network to fuse features for detection.

Result: Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD across the multimodal misinformation detection task.

Conclusion: RETSIMD demonstrates that segment-level text-to-image augmentation combined with graph-based fusion can more effectively exploit text-dominant information in MMD. The approach suggests promising directions for better cross-modal alignment and future work on segmentation strategies and more robust cross-modal objectives.

Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.

*Xin Zuo,Yuchen Qu,Haibo Zhan,Jifeng Shen,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFFR introduces frequency-aware spatial and frequency feature reconstruction for UAV multispectral object detection, using FCEKAN (frequency component exchange) and MSGKAN (multi-scale Gaussian KAN) to enhance cross-modal fusion. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle, and DVTOD; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multispectral fusion largely emphasizes spatial-domain features; frequency-domain information and cross-modal complementarities (RGB-IR) remain underexplored, limiting robustness to scale variations and cross-modal alignment in UAV imagery.

Method: Propose Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction (SFFR) framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Introduce Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) to selectively exchange frequency components between RGB and IR features, enhancing cross-modal complementarity; introduce Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) to model nonlinear spatial features using multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, improving scale robustness. Reconstruct representations in both spatial and frequency domains before feature fusion.

Result: Ablation and extensive experiments on SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle, and DVTOD show that FCEKAN and MSGKAN are complementary and improve feature fusion by capturing frequency- and spatial-semantic cues. The method achieves superior performance on UAV multispectral object perception tasks and demonstrates robustness to scale variation across different flight altitudes.

Conclusion: SFFR with FCEKAN and MSGKAN effectively leverages spatial and frequency features for enhanced cross-modal fusion in UAV multispectral detection, offering a promising direction for robust object perception across varying scales; code will be released.

Abstract: Recent multispectral object detection methods have primarily focused on spatial-domain feature fusion based on CNNs or Transformers, while the potential of frequency-domain feature remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

*Haoqin Hong,Ding Fan,Fubin Dou,Zhi-Li Zhou,Haoran Sun,Congcong Zhu,Jingrun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIDG extends 3D Gaussian Splatting by incorporating physics-informed Lagrangian material points, with a 4D static-dynamic hash encoding, Cauchy momentum constraints, and optical-flow supervision, to improve physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure data-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles to capture physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes from monocular input; integrating physics constraints can improve realism, stability, and generalization.

Method: Treat each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters; use static-dynamic decoupled 4D hash encoding for geometry and motion; enforce Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint to predict per-particle velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field; supervise data fitting by aligning Lagrangian particle flow with camera-compensated optical flow to accelerate convergence.

Result: Demonstrates significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as standard synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: A physics-informed extension to 3D Gaussian Splatting yields more physically plausible dynamic reconstructions from monocular video, with better convergence and generalization, by integrating a Lagrangian particle-based physics model and optical-flow supervision.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

### [105] [Adaptive 3D Reconstruction via Diffusion Priors and Forward Curvature-Matching Likelihood Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06310)
*Seunghyeok Shin,Dabin Kim,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) for diffusion-based point-cloud reconstruction that enables flexible single- and multi-view inputs without retraining, achieving faster convergence and higher quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based posterior approaches are inflexible: require conditioning signals during training, support limited input views, and need retraining for different measurements. Prior methods use heuristic fixed step sizes for likelihood updates causing slow convergence and suboptimal reconstructions.

Method: Integrates FCM update with diffusion sampling; uses forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates to dynamically determine optimal step sizes for likelihood updates; enables precise optimization of the likelihood update; supports multiple input modalities via operator substitution; no retraining required.

Result: On ShapeNet and CO3D, achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs; higher F-score and lower CD and EMD; demonstrates efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: FCM constitutes a flexible, efficient likelihood-update mechanism for diffusion-based reconstruction; supports single- or multi-view inputs and various modalities without retraining; code available.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

*Gur Elkn,Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Language-models solve square jigsaw puzzles from tokenized pieces without visual input, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrate cross-domain capabilities of language models; question the assumption that puzzle solving requires visual data; explore whether token-based sequence modeling can reassemble layouts.

Method: Introduce a specialized tokenizer to convert each puzzle piece into a discrete token sequence; frame puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task; use encoder-decoder transformers as blind solvers with no raw visual input; train to reconstruct original layout.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks; often outperforms vision-based methods.

Conclusion: Shows LMs can tackle problems outside their native domain; encourages unconventional approaches for puzzle-solving and broader cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzles are primarily visual objects, whose algorithmic solutions have traditionally been framed from a visual perspective. In this work, however, we explore a fundamentally different approach: solving square jigsaw puzzles using language models, without access to raw visual input. By introducing a specialized tokenizer that converts each puzzle piece into a discrete sequence of tokens, we reframe puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Treated as "blind" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods. These findings highlight the surprising capability of language models to solve problems beyond their native domain, and suggest that unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research.

### [107] [CINEMAE: Leveraging Frozen Masked Autoencoders for Cross-Generator AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06325)
*Minsuk Jang,Hyeonseo Jeong,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CINEMAE uses context-conditional MAE reconstruction uncertainty to detect AI-generated images, achieving strong cross-generator generalization by computing conditional NLL and fusing local and global MAE features; trained on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and outperforming baselines on GenImage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based AIGC detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts, hindering generalization. By adapting text-detection ideas to images and leveraging MAE’s reconstruction as a semantic-consistency proxy, the method seeks a transferable signal across generators.

Method: Train a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) to reconstruct masked image patches conditioned on visible context. Compute the conditional Negative Log-Likelihood p(masked | visible) for each patch as a local anomaly score. Aggregate patch-level NLLs with global MAE features using a learned fusion to produce a final detection score. The model is trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and evaluated on eight unseen generators.

Result: CINEMAE achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: Context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty from MAE provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection, enabling strong cross-generator generalization without generator-specific artifacts.

Abstract: While context-based detectors have achieved strong generalization for AI-generated text by measuring distributional inconsistencies, image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts. We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.

### [108] [Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Modality Optimization and Dynamic Primary Modality Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06328)
*Dingkang Yang,Mingcheng Li,Xuecheng Wu,Zhaoyu Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Keliang Liu,Peng Zhai,Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MODS is a multimodal sentiment analysis framework that dynamically optimizes modality contributions by selecting a primary modality per sample and reducing sequential redundancy in non-language streams, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets through GDC, MSelector, and PCCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sentiment analysis suffers from imbalanced unimodal performance and fixed primary modality strategies. Non-language modalities introduce redundancy and noise, and their dominance should vary across samples. A dynamic, modality-aware fusion strategy is needed.

Method: GDC uses capsule networks and graph convolution to compress acoustic/visual sequences and reduce redundancy. MSelector adaptively determines the primary modality for each sample. PCCA applies cross-attention centered on the dominant modality to enhance it while enabling cross-modal interaction.

Result: MODS achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating better balance among modality cues and effective noise elimination through dynamic primary modality selection and targeted cross-modal attention.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sample-aware modality optimization with structured compression and cross-attention yields robust multimodal sentiment analysis, suggesting broader applicability to other multimodal tasks that suffer from modality imbalance and noise.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to predict sentiment from language, acoustic, and visual data in videos. However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised and transfer learning reduce annotation needs for 3D tree analysis, boosting instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and species classification; provides a unified open-source framework with ~21% energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution tree-level information from lidar point clouds is crucial for precision forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping, but deep learning typically requires large annotated datasets which are hard to scale; this study seeks to reduce that dependency.

Method: Combine self-supervised learning with domain adaptation and hierarchical transfer learning; integrate three tasks (instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, tree classification) into a unified framework—from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification; evaluate on realistic operational training sets and emphasize pretrained models to reduce energy use.

Result: Significant performance gains: instance segmentation AP50 improved by 16.98 percentage points when using self-supervised/transfer learning vs training from scratch; semantic segmentation mIoU increased by 1.79 percentage points; classification of unseen species (Jaccard) increased by 6.07 percentage points; pretrained models led to ~21% energy consumption reduction; open-source contribution.

Conclusion: The approach accelerates practical extraction of individual tree information from lidar point clouds for forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping; reduces the need for large annotated datasets and promotes sustainable, scalable analysis through an open-source framework.

Abstract: Detailed structural and species information on individual tree level is increasingly important to support precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and provide reference data for biomass and carbon mapping. Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.

TL;DR: BuildingWorld introduces a globally diverse 3D building dataset (~5M LOD2 models) with real and simulated LiDAR, plus Cyber City for unlimited synthetic data and standardized metrics to improve generalization of urban 3D models and support large-scale foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D urban datasets lack architectural diversity, limiting generalizability of learning-based models across heterogeneous urban environments; a globally representative, structured dataset is needed for robust urban-scale modeling.

Method: Collect ~5 million LOD2 building models from diverse regions (N. America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania) and pair with real and simulated airborne LiDAR; introduce Cyber City to generate unlimited, customizable training data with varied point-cloud distributions; provide standardized evaluation metrics for building reconstruction.

Result: A comprehensive dataset and tooling package: ~5M LOD2 models, real and simulated LiDAR data, Cyber City for synthetic data generation, and tailored evaluation metrics to facilitate training, evaluation, and comparison of vision/foundation models in 3D urban contexts.

Conclusion: BuildingWorld fills the diversity gap in 3D urban data, enabling robust training/evaluation for large-scale models and supporting research in reconstruction, detection, and segmentation across globally diverse cities.

Abstract: As digital twins become central to the transformation of modern cities, accurate and structured 3D building models emerge as a key enabler of high-fidelity, updatable urban representations. These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning. Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most learning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited architectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability across heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeVLM introduces a vision-language model to jointly perform multi-task gaze understanding (person detection, gaze target detection, gaze object identification) by fusing RGB and depth with text prompts, introducing a new AP_ob metric, and achieving SOTA on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a unified framework that can perform multiple gaze-related tasks using both visual cues and language prompts, beyond existing methods that model gaze cues in isolation.

Method: A Vision-Language Model (GazeVLM) that enables selective execution of tasks (detection and identification) across three gaze-related tasks, integrating RGB and HHA-encoded depth with text prompts. An object-level gaze detection metric (AP_ob) is introduced. An ablation study assesses the impact of input modalities.

Result: Significant improvements with state-of-the-art performance on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets. The ablation shows RGB+HHA depth fusion guided by text prompts yields the best results; a new AP_ob metric is proposed for gaze object identification.

Conclusion: GazeVLM demonstrates the viability of a single VLM framework for combined gaze understanding tasks, highlights the benefit of multimodal fusion (RGB+depth) with language guidance, and introduces a practical metric (AP_ob) to evaluate gaze object identification.

Abstract: Gaze understanding unifies the detection of people, their gaze targets, and objects of interest into a single framework, offering critical insight into visual attention and intent estimation. Although prior research has modelled gaze cues in visual scenes, a unified system is still needed for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts. This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$). Through experiments, GazeVLM demonstrates significant improvements, notably achieving state-of-the-art evaluation scores on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.

TL;DR: AesTest is a proposed benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, with 10 tasks across perception, appreciation, creation, and photography; it uses diverse data sources and supports multiple aesthetic queries; initial results show models struggle, and a public release is planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image aesthetic assessment benchmarks are narrow and fail to evaluate broader aesthetic reasoning and production. There is a need for a comprehensive, psychology-grounded benchmark that covers perception, appreciation, and creation in multimodal settings.

Method: Curate 10 tasks spanning perception, appreciation, creation, and photography, grounded in generative learning theory. Use data from professional editing workflows, photographic tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences to cover expert principles and real-world variation. Support query types like attribute-based analysis, emotional resonance, compositional choice, and stylistic reasoning. Evaluate instruction-tuned IAA MLLMs and general MLLMs.

Result: Initial evaluation reveals significant challenges in building aesthetic intelligence; models struggle across tasks, indicating gaps in current capabilities and the need for better data and training paradigms.

Conclusion: AesTest addresses a critical gap by providing a broader, psychology-informed benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, with public release planned to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Perceiving and producing aesthetic judgments is a fundamental yet underexplored capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment (IAA) are narrow in perception scope or lack the diversity needed to evaluate systematic aesthetic production. To address this gap, we introduce AesTest, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, distinguished by the following features: 1) It consists of curated multiple-choice questions spanning ten tasks, covering perception, appreciation, creation, and photography. These tasks are grounded in psychological theories of generative learning. 2) It integrates data from diverse sources, including professional editing workflows, photographic composition tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences. It ensures coverage of both expert-level principles and real-world variation. 3) It supports various aesthetic query types, such as attribute-based analysis, emotional resonance, compositional choice, and stylistic reasoning. We evaluate both instruction-tuned IAA MLLMs and general MLLMs on AesTest, revealing significant challenges in building aesthetic intelligence. We will publicly release AesTest to support future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Shuffle is a diffusion-based zero-shot style transfer method that uses multiple style images to mitigate content leakage by shuffling value features in self-attention, plus Hybrid Style Regularization to enrich high-level textures; it achieves strong style fidelity and content preservation, outperforming prior SOTA especially with a single style image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address content leakage and poor balance between content preservation and style fidelity in attention injection style transfer, particularly in zero-shot settings, by leveraging multiple style images and balancing low-level and high-level style representations.

Method: Incorporates value-feature shuffling within the self-attention layers of a diffusion model to disrupt semantic content of style images while preserving low-level style cues. Introduces Hybrid Style Regularization to combine low-level style features with high-level textures to improve overall style fidelity. Evaluates in zero-shot scenarios using multiple style images from the same domain, and also assesses performance with a single style image.

Result: Empirical results show strong performance when using multiple style images. When applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: V-Shuffle effectively mitigates content leakage and enhances style fidelity by combining discrepancy-inducing self-attention perturbations with a complementary regularization that captures high-level textures, achieving strong results in both multi-style and single-style settings.

Abstract: Attention injection-based style transfer has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where the undesired semantic content of the style image mistakenly appears in the stylized output. In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collect the raw data from six domains and aligned them via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee the quality and compliance. After that we construct an affect table and use it to constrain annotation. Five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) then analyze both modalities, and their outputs are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.986, which indicates high accuracy.

### [115] [On Modality Incomplete Infrared-Visible Object Detection: An Architecture Compatibility Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06406)
*Shuo Yang,Yinghui Xing,Shizhou Zhang,Zhilong Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scarf-DETR provides a plug-and-play neck with a modality-agnostic deformable attention to handle incomplete IVOD data, enabling robust performance with either single or dual modalities, aided by pseudo modality dropout and a new modality-incomplete benchmark; it also achieves strong results on complete-modality benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrared-visible object detection (IVOD) models degrade significantly when one modality is missing, especially when the dominant modality is absent. There is a need for architecture-agnostic solutions that gracefully handle single- and dual-modality inputs during both training and inference.

Method: Introduce a Scarf Neck module for DETR variants that implements a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism. Train with a pseudo modality dropout strategy to exploit multi-modality information and enable compatibility with single- and dual-modality operation. Develop a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate modality-incomplete IVOD, including cases where the absent modality is dominant or secondary.

Result: Scarf-DETR performs well in missing-modality scenarios and also achieves superior performance on standard, modality-complete IVOD benchmarks. The approach is plug-and-play with DETR variants and is expected to be robust across different modality configurations.

Conclusion: A modality-agnostic Scarf Neck and pseudo modality dropout enable DETR-based IVOD detectors to adapt to any single or double modalities, improving robustness to incomplete data and maintaining strong performance on complete-modality tasks; a new benchmark supports thorough evaluation.

Abstract: Infrared and visible object detection (IVOD) is essential for numerous around-the-clock applications. Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary. Our proposed Scarf-DETR not only performs excellently in missing modality scenarios but also achieves superior performances on the standard IVOD modality complete benchmarks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/Scarf-DETR.

### [116] [VDNeRF: Vision-only Dynamic Neural Radiance Field for Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06408)
*Zhengyu Zou,Jingfeng Li,Hao Li,Xiaolei Hou,Jinwen Hu,Jingkun Chen,Lechao Cheng,Dingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDNeRF: a pose-free NeRF framework for dynamic urban scenes that jointly learns static and dynamic components without external pose data, enabling camera trajectory recovery and dynamic view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-based methods struggle in autonomous driving/robotic perception due to reliance on accurate camera poses and difficulty handling large-scale dynamic environments; pose data acquisition is expensive or unavailable.

Method: Two jointly trained NeRFs: a static NeRF that optimizes camera poses and static background, and a dynamic NeRF that incorporates 3D scene flow to capture moving objects. A training framework addresses the ambiguity between camera motion and object motion to robustly estimate poses and decompose static/dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner.

Result: VDNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free NeRF methods on pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis across mainstream urban driving datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate pose recovery and robust dynamic scene reconstruction without external pose or sensor data, advancing NeRF applications in autonomous driving and robotic perception.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) implicitly model continuous three-dimensional scenes using a set of images with known camera poses, enabling the rendering of photorealistic novel views. However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.

### [117] [DiffusionUavLoc: Visually Prompted Diffusion for Cross-View UAV Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06422)
*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionUavLoc uses a diffusion-based, text-free cross-view localization approach to bridge UAV (oblique) and satellite (nadir) views. It synthesizes pseudo-satellite prompts from UAV imagery via training-free geometric rendering, uses a text-free conditional diffusion model with a VAE for unified representation, and relies on fixed-time-step descriptors with cosine similarity. Evaluated on University-1652 and SUES-200, with competitive performance especially for satellite-to-drone localization, and code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In GNSS-denied environments, localization based solely on satellite signals fails. Cross-view localization between oblique UAV imagery and nadir satellite imagery promises a solution, but large geometric and appearance gaps, plus reliance on heavy annotations or prompts in existing methods hinder generalization.

Method: Propose DiffusionUavLoc: (1) training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts; (2) a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn viewpoint-robust features; (3) a VAE for unified representation; (4) inference uses fixed time step t and cosine similarity for descriptor matching.

Result: On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method achieves competitive cross-view localization performance, with particular strength in satellite-to-drone localization on University-1652.

Conclusion: Data and code will be published at the provided GitHub URL, enabling replication and further research in diffusion-based cross-view UAV localization.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key platforms for measurement and tracking in intelligent patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.

### [118] [Diagnose Like A REAL Pathologist: An Uncertainty-Focused Approach for Trustworthy Multi-Resolution Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06433)
*Sungrae Hong,Sol Lee,Jisu Shin,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFC-MIL introduces a calibrated multi-resolution MIL framework for histopathology that targets trustworthy predictions by modeling patch-level uncertainty, achieving superior calibration with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In histopathology, clinicians need trustworthy, well-calibrated AI predictions. Existing multi-resolution MIL methods improve accuracy but neglect calibration, risking overconfident or unreliable decisions.

Method: UFC-MIL employs a novel patch-wise loss to learn latent instance patterns and quantify their uncertainty, uses an attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module to collect features for classification, and calibrates aggregated predictions via patch-level uncertainty without requiring iterative inferences.

Result: On challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL delivers superior calibration and maintains classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UFC-MIL advances calibrated MIL for histopathology, aligning AI predictions more closely with clinical reasoning and enabling more trustworthy diagnostic support without extra inference cost.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

### [119] [Countering Multi-modal Representation Collapse through Rank-targeted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06450)
*Seulgi Kim,Kiran Kokilepersaud,Mohit Prabhushankar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Rank-enhancing Token Fuser to address both feature and modality collapse in multi-modal fusion using effective rank; introduces depth-informed R3D for action anticipation; achieves state-of-the-art gains on RGB-D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal fusion methods struggle with two forms of representation collapse (feature and modality) and lack a unified framework to address them jointly.

Method: Introduce effective rank as a unifying measure; selectively fuse less informative features from one modality with complementary ones from another to increase fused representation rank; analyze modality pairs to maintain balance (e.g., depth with RGB); implement R3D for depth-informed fusion in action anticipation.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over prior SOTA, up to 3.74% on action anticipation benchmarks (NTURGBD, UTKinect, DARai); code released.

Conclusion: Effective rank is a practical metric to quantify and counter both feature and modality collapse; the proposed Rank-enhancing Token Fuser and depth-informed fusion (R3D) yield stronger, balanced representations for multi-modal action anticipation.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

### [120] [EIDSeg: A Pixel-Level Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment from Social Media Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06456)
*Huili Huang,Chengeng Liu,Danrong Zhang,Shail Patel,Anastasiya Masalava,Sagar Sadak,Parisa Babolhavaeji,WeiHong Low,Max Mahdi Roozbahani,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces EIDSeg, a large-scale semantic segmentation dataset for post-earthquake social media images (3,266 images, 9 earthquakes, 5 classes), with a three-phase annotation protocol achieving >70% inter-annotator agreement; EoMT yields 80.8% mIoU on benchmarks, enabling finer-grained post-disaster damage assessment from ground-level images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-disaster damage assessment relies on costly aerial imagery and expert labels; social-media ground-level images offer valuable perspective but lack labeled datasets; need scalable, fine-grained segmentation to support rescue/resource planning.

Method: Collect 3,266 images from nine earthquakes; annotate with a three-phase cross-disciplinary protocol for five classes: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, Damaged Road; non-expert annotators; guidelines to ensure consistency; benchmark segmentation models; identify Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as best with mIoU 80.8%.

Result: Created EIDSeg dataset; achieved over 70% inter-annotator agreement; EoMT achieved 80.8% mIoU; demonstrates viability of using social-media imagery for finer-grained damage assessment.

Conclusion: This dataset unlocks ground-level perspectives from social networks, enabling faster, more granular post-earthquake damage assessment; potential to supplement aerial data for rescue and resource planning.

Abstract: Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is crucial for rescue and resource planning. Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%. By unlocking social networks' rich ground-level perspective, our work paves the way for a faster, finer-grained damage assessment in the post-earthquake scenario.

### [121] [Inpaint360GS: Efficient Object-Aware 3D Inpainting via Gaussian Splatting for 360° Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06457)
*Shaoxiang Wang,Shihong Zhang,Christen Millerdurai,Rüdiger Westermann,Didier Stricker,Alain Pagani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Inpaint360GS, a 360° multi-object inpainting/editing framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to remove objects with consistent 3D inpainting; introduces 2D-to-3D segmentation distillation, virtual camera guidance, and a new 360° inpainting dataset; reports state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing in 360° environments faces (i) identifying targets in 3D space, (ii) severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, and (iii) ensuring view-consistent, high-quality appearance across angles. The paper aims to enable flexible, accurate, and consistent 360° object removal and scene completion.

Method: A flexible 360° editing framework (Inpaint360GS) built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity 3D inpainting. Key components include distilling 2D segmentation into 3D, and leveraging virtual camera views to provide contextual guidance for accurate object-level edits and coherent scene completion. A new dataset for 360° inpainting with ground-truth object-free scenes is introduced.

Result: Experiments show Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 360° inpainting/editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables flexible, multi-object 360° editing with high-quality, consistent inpainting in 3D space, aided by 2D-to-3D segmentation distillation and synthetic contextual guidance; the new dataset addresses the lack of ground-truth object-free 360° scenes and supports robust evaluation.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360° scenes remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360° environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360° inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://dfki-av.github.io/inpaint360gs/

### [122] [NOAH: Benchmarking Narrative Prior driven Hallucination and Omission in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06475)
*Kyuho Lee,Euntae Kim,Jinwoo Choi,Buru Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOAH benchmark reveals narrative priors in Video LLMs cause hallucinations and omissions; composite-video evaluation enables controlled analysis; results show architecture-dependent patterns and frame-sampling effects; NOAH enables standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs optimize for narrative continuity, risking grounding in visual evidence. A systematic evaluation is needed to quantify narrative-prior-induced errors (hallucinations/omissions) and drive trustworthy models.

Method: Construct NOAH by inserting external clips into target videos to create composites; control semantic similarity and insertion position; create tasks: one captioning task with metrics plus three QA tasks (Existence, Temporal, Narrative); >60k samples; evaluate multiple Video LLMs and analyze error patterns across architectures and settings.

Result: Most Video LLMs show hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors. Error patterns vary by architecture and depend on event similarity and insertion position. Narrative-prior reliance increases when sampling uses fewer frames, amplifying errors when continuity is weak.

Conclusion: NOAH is the first standardized evaluation of narrative-prior-induced hallucination/omission in Video LLMs, enabling progression toward more reliable models; code and benchmark available at provided link.

Abstract: Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models. Our benchmark and code are available at https://anonymous550520.github.io/.

### [123] [Zooming into Comics: Region-Aware RL Improves Fine-Grained Comic Understanding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06490)
*Yule Chen,Yufan Ren,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new fine-grained benchmark AI4VA-FG reveals that current VLMs struggle with comic understanding across basic recognition to narrative reasoning; post-training fine-tuning and region-aware reinforcement learning (RARL) offer notable improvements on Qwen2.5-VL but the task remains largely unsolved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comics feature stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel narratives that standard Vision-Language Models struggle to interpret. There is a gap in fine-grained benchmarks that cover from low-level recognition to high-level reasoning in comics, necessitating datasets, evaluations, and learning strategies tailored to this domain.

Method: 1) Propose AI4VA-FG, a fine-grained benchmark with dense annotations for characters, poses, depth, and a spectrum of tasks from foundational recognition to narrative construction. 2) Evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL) on core tasks. 3) Explore post-training strategies: SFT-S (supervised fine-tuning on solutions), SFT-R (supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories), and RL (reinforcement learning). 4) Introduce Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) to train models to attend to relevant regions via zoom-in operations. 5) Empirically study these methods on the Qwen2.5-VL model.

Result: The benchmark reveals substantial performance deficits across core tasks for both proprietary and open-source models, confirming that comic understanding remains challenging. RL and RARL demonstrate significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering when applied to Qwen2.5-VL, indicating the potential of region-focused training strategies to improve VLM performance in comics.

Conclusion: Comic understanding is far from solved, even for advanced models. The proposed AI4VA-FG benchmark exposes key weaknesses, and the combination of SFT/S-RL and especially Region-Aware RL can yield meaningful improvements, motivating further research and broader evaluation across more models and tasks.

Abstract: Complex visual narratives, such as comics, present a significant challenge to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SportR is a new large-scale, multi-sport benchmark for training and evaluating multimodal large language models on fine-grained visual perception, abstract rule knowledge, and evidence-grounded reasoning, featuring 5,017 images and 2,101 videos, a hierarchical QA scheme, 7,118 CoT annotations, and image grounding via bounding boxes; results show state-of-the-art models struggle, with improvements from SFT and RL but persisting gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports benchmarks are limited to single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed for robust, multi-sport multimodal evaluation. A unified multi-sport dataset is needed to push fundamental sports intelligence in MLLMs.

Method: Assemble SportR dataset with images and videos across multiple sports; design a progressive hierarchy of QA pairs probing increasing reasoning depth (from infraction ID to penalty prediction); provide multi-step Chain of Thought annotations for advanced tasks; include manual bounding box annotations for image grounding and support both image and video modalities; baseline experiments via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Result: Experiments show the benchmark is profoundly difficult: current SOTA models perform poorly on challenging tasks; SFT and RL improve scores but remain relatively low, indicating a significant gap in model capabilities.

Conclusion: SportR introduces a critical resource that will drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning, offering a multi-sport, grounding-enabled benchmark with scalable evaluation of complex, multi-step reasoning across sports.

Abstract: Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap in large, temporally aware, multi-center datasets that cover multiple interrelated tasks in surgical scene understanding; existing datasets often address isolated tasks or lack temporal/multi-center variability.

Method: Collected eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three medical centers; provided frame-level annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames); enables exploitation of temporal context by providing full procedure sequences; supported the PhaKIR Challenge at MICCAI 2024 EndoVis; publicly available upon request via Zenodo.

Result: PhaKIR is the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations; dataset includes 485,875 phase frames, 19,435 keypoint frames, and 19,435 segmentation frames; enables temporal modeling and benchmarking for surgical scene understanding.

Conclusion: PhaKIR offers a valuable, temporally rich, multi-task resource for surgical scene understanding and cross-center generalization, serving as a benchmark platform (EndoVis MICCAI 2024) and is publicly accessible upon request.

Abstract: Robotic- and computer-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is increasingly relying on computer vision methods for reliable instrument recognition and surgical workflow understanding. Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance. The dataset is publicly available upon request via the Zenodo platform.

TL;DR: A Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) framework for MMIF that uses a three-branch MMIF+IR coupling, Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Blocks (SFMB) for improved spatial and frequency feature extraction, and Dynamic Fusion Mamba Blocks (DFMB) for cross-branch fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on six MMIF datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of CNN-based and Transformer-based MMIF methods, the incomplete spatial and frequency perception of Mamba, and the suboptimal use of Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task in MMIF.

Method: Introduce a three-branch structure that couples MMIF and IR; develop SFMBs to enhance Mamba in spatial and frequency domains; implement DFMBs to enable dynamic fusion across branches.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMFusion outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets.

Conclusion: SFMFusion effectively combines spatial-frequency enhanced long-range modeling with a dynamic fusion strategy and IR integration, yielding improved MMIF performance; the source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/SunHui1216/SFMFusion.

*Yifei Zhang,Jiashuo Zhang,Xiaofeng Yang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainable, cross-disease framework for cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan, integrating pulmonary perception, knowledge-guided reasoning, and cardiac representation to predict cardiovascular risk with interpretable explanations; achieves state-of-the-art results on NLST for CVD screening and mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT captures both lung and cardiac structures, but existing methods treat them separately, missing physiological interplay and shared biomarkers. A unified, explainable framework can improve prediction and provide mechanism-grounded interpretations.

Method: An agentic reasoning pipeline: 1) pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, 2) knowledge-guided reasoning module that maps these findings to cardiovascular implications, 3) cardiac representation module encoding structural biomarkers. Outputs are fused to yield a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction accompanied by explanatory rationale grounded in medical knowledge.

Result: On the NLST cohort, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for cardiovascular disease screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified, explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, linking imaging biomarkers to cardiological mechanisms and aligning image-based prediction with mechanism-based medical interpretation.

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

*Chenpeng Su,Wenhua Wu,Chensheng Peng,Tianchen Deng,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised dynamic instance-aware 4D Gaussian splatting method (DIAL-GS) for label-free urban scene reconstruction that separates dynamic objects from static background and enables instance-level editing; it outperforms self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require costly annotations and don't scale well for urban scenes. Self-supervised approaches often confuse static and dynamic elements and struggle to isolate individual dynamic objects, hindering fine-grained editing and realistic synthesis.

Method: Identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped renderings and actual observations. Use instance-aware 4D Gaussian splats as a unified volumetric representation that adapts to dynamics and preserves per-instance identity. Introduce a reciprocal mechanism where identity and dynamics reinforce each other to improve consistency.

Result: On urban driving datasets, DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and enables accurate instance-level editing of dynamic objects within the scene.

Conclusion: DIAL-GS provides a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling, enabling dynamic instance-aware reconstruction without labels and improving both fidelity and editability of 4D scene representations.

Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing. Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability, while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling.

*Ximiao Zhang,Min Xu,Zheng Zhang,Junlin Hu,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniADC presents a unified framework for anomaly detection, localization, and classification by using a training-free controllable inpainting network to synthesize category-specific anomalies and a multi-task discriminator that learns from these samples, enabling effective performance with little or no anomaly data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat anomaly detection and classification separately, underutilizing their inherent correlation and suffering from limited anomaly data. A unified, data-efficient approach could improve performance by sharing information between tasks and leveraging synthetic anomalies.

Method: Two components: (1) a training-free controllable inpainting network that repaints normal regions guided by anomaly priors to synthesize anomalies of specific categories and can augment few-shot anomaly samples; (2) a multi-task discriminator trained on these synthesized samples to perform anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings.

Result: Experiments on three datasets—MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD—show UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification; code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: A data-efficient, unified framework can effectively handle detection and classification of anomalies with limited anomaly data by combining synthetic inpainting-based data generation and joint feature-alignment learning for discrimination.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

### [130] [FreqGRL: Suppressing Low-Frequency Bias and Mining High-Frequency Knowledge for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06648)
*Siqi Hui,Sanping Zhou,Ye deng,Wenli Huang,Jinjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqGRL is a frequency-space CD-FSL framework that uses Low-Frequency Replacement, High-Frequency Enhancement, and Global Frequency Filter to tackle data imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data, achieving state-of-the-art results on five CD-FSL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In cross-domain few-shot learning, large domain shifts and the imbalance between abundant labeled source data and scarce labeled target data cause models to overfit to source-specific, low-frequency information while underlearning high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. A frequency-space analysis provides a principled lens to diagnose and address these issues.

Method: FreqGRL comprises three components: (1) Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) that swaps the low-frequency content of source tasks with target-domain content to create source tasks more aligned with target characteristics; (2) High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) that suppresses low-frequency components and learns on high-frequency features to boost cross-domain generalization; (3) Global Frequency Filter (GFF) that filters out noisy or irrelevant frequencies to reduce overfitting under limited target supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks show that FreqGRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of frequency-space guided learning under data imbalance.

Conclusion: A frequency-guided framework can effectively mitigate source biases and enhance cross-domain generalization in CD-FSL by rebalancing information across frequency bands and suppressing noisy frequencies, highlighting the value of the frequency-space perspective in this setting.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with only a few labeled examples under significant domain shifts. While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Kyung-Yoon Yoon,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOVO introduces visual-only prompts to connect vision-language models with segmentation models, using coarse masks and point prompts derived from VLM outputs, plus a training-free refinement module and a new RISeg benchmark; achieves SOTA in reasoning segmentation across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on text-derived segment-token embeddings and improve boundary quality for segmentation tasks via VLM outputs, enabling scalable, instance-level reasoning segmentation by interfacing with SAM.

Method: Generate a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output, produce visual prompts compatible with SAM; incorporate a training-free refinement module to reduce artifacts and sharpen boundaries; introduce RISeg benchmark for evaluation; evaluate across model sizes.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on several metrics and model sizes for reasoning segmentation; demonstrates effectiveness and scalability; better boundary quality and instance-level segmentation.

Conclusion: Visual prompts bridging VLMs and segmentation models are effective; NOVO offers scalable, strong performance with a simple refinement module and RISeg as robust evaluation dataset; potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: In this study, we propose NOVO (NO text, Visual-Only prompts), a novel framework that bridges vision-language models (VLMs) and segmentation models through visual-only prompts. Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task. Experiments demonstrate that NOVO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in reasoning segmentation.

*Ruijia Wu,Ping Chen,Fei Shen,Shaoan Zhao,Qiang Hui,Huanlin Gao,Ting Lu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Fang Zhao,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMo-CLIP improves CLIP by hierarchy-aware decomposition of long-form text and a monotonicity-aware loss, enhancing image-text retrieval for long/compositional descriptions without changing encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP treats text as flat sequences, hindering semantic hierarchy and monotonicity; there is a need for representations that capture multi-level structure and ordering between textual completeness and alignment with visual content.

Method: Two components: (1) HiDe: a hierarchical decomposition module using in-batch PCA to extract latent semantic components from long-form text, enabling batch-aware alignment across semantic granularities; (2) MoLo: a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging semantic ordering and stronger alignment as descriptions become richer.

Result: Experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks show consistent improvements over strong baselines, especially for long or compositional descriptions; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: HiMo-CLIP demonstrates that combining hierarchical text decomposition with a monotonicity-aware loss yields structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations without modifying encoder architectures.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have achieved impressive results in image-text retrieval by aligning image and text representations in a shared embedding space. However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

*Depanshu Sani,Mehar Khurana,Saket Anand*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active-learning Re-ID framework for animals using complementary clustering to identify structurally ambiguous embedding regions and mine informative, representative sample pairs. Oracle feedback via must-link/cannot-link constraints guides a constrained clustering refinement that integrates with unsupervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art animal Re-ID with only 0.033% annotations across 13 wildlife datasets, including improvements for unknown individuals in open-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models and existing unsupervised/active-learning methods underperform on animal Re-ID due to open-set conditions, environmental variability, and heavy annotation costs. There is a need for an annotation-efficient strategy that leverages structure in the embedding space to produce broadly representative, informative pairs.

Method: Proposes complementary clustering to discover structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space and mine informative representative sample pairs. Oracle provides must-link and cannot-link constraints via a simple annotation interface. Introduces a constrained clustering refinement algorithm that integrates these constraints with existing USL methods, enabling efficient annotation of a tiny fraction (0.033%) of data.

Result: Across 13 wildlife datasets, the method yields average mAP gains of 10.49% over foundational, 11.19% over USL, and 3.99% over AL baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. In open-world settings, unknown individuals see improvements of 11.09% (vs foundation), 8.2% (vs USL), and 2.06% (vs AL).

Conclusion: An annotation-efficient AL Re-ID framework with constrained clustering can substantially outperform baselines in animal Re-ID, including unknown individuals, by targeting structurally informative regions in embedding space and leveraging minimal must-link/cannot-link feedback.

Abstract: Animal Re-ID has recently gained substantial attention in the AI research community due to its high impact on biodiversity monitoring and unique research challenges arising from environmental factors. The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Furthermore, we also show an improvement of 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% for unknown individuals in an open-world setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis should combine segmentation with explainable diagnosis; existing work lacks joint modeling and interpretable outputs. A dataset with diagnosis reasoning (chain-of-thought) and a multimodal framework can bridge segmentation and diagnosis.

Method: Introduce M3DS, a multimodal multi-disease medical dataset with segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought. Propose Sim4Seg, which uses Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) to align textual diagnosis queries with image regions and masks, along with a test-time scaling strategy.

Result: Experimental results show that Sim4Seg with RVLS2M outperforms baselines on both segmentation and diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: The work defines the MDS task, provides a dataset and a model that jointly handles segmentation and diagnostic reasoning, and demonstrates performance gains and potential for explainable medical AI, aided by test-time scaling.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction using cameras alone struggles in challenging environments; radar offers complementary information but is sparse and noisy. Enhancing radar feature representations is key to effective camera-radar fusion.

Method: Two modules—Radar Densifier and Radar Amplifier—refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information to improve spatial density and quality, then fuse with camera data to predict 3D occupancy. Evaluated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark.

Result: Significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline, particularly for dynamic object classes; demonstrates mitigation of radar sparsity and noise and improved camera-radar fusion.

Conclusion: Radar can complement camera data more effectively, unlocking the potential of camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has made significant advancements, but its reliance on cameras alone struggles in challenging environments. This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths. However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic object classes. These results underscore REOcc's capability to mitigate the sparsity and noise of the radar data. Consequently, radar complements camera data more effectively, unlocking the full potential of camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.

TL;DR: Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM) uses a hypernetwork to generate prediction weights from concept embeddings, enabling dynamic concept adaptation (including full replacement of concept sets) without retraining; includes a learnable-temperature sparsemax; achieves competitive accuracy and good generalization with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model (VLM)-based concept bottleneck approaches require retraining when new concepts are added, limiting adaptability in fast-evolving setups. There is a need for dynamic, flexible integration of new concepts with minimal cost.

Method: Introduce a hypernetwork that maps concept embeddings to prediction weights, enabling seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model and allowing replacement of the original concept set. Add a modified sparsemax with a learnable temperature to dynamically select the most relevant concepts. Evaluate on five public benchmarks and test unseen concepts with a single epoch of fine-tuning.

Result: The method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. It generalizes well to unseen concepts with just one epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating strong adaptability and flexibility.

Conclusion: FCBM provides dynamic concept adaptation and flexible integration of new concepts without full retraining, while maintaining competitive performance. It demonstrates robust adaptability across benchmarks and rapid adaptation to unseen concepts.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) improve neural network interpretability by introducing an intermediate layer that maps human-understandable concepts to predictions. Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. Moreover, the model generalizes well to unseen concepts with just a single epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong adaptability and flexibility.

*Yulim So,Seokho Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoStyler presents a lightweight zero-shot anomaly generator via text-guided style transfer that converts a single normal image into a realistic, localized anomaly using CLIP-based losses, enabling effective augmentation for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scarcity of anomaly images and shortcomings of prior methods, namely low visual realism, dependence on large amounts of real data, and heavyweight architectures.

Method: Frame anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Generate an anomaly mask and two-class prompts (normal vs anomaly) using category-agnostic procedures. Train a lightweight U-Net with CLIP-based losses to stylize the normal image into a realistic anomaly, with anisotropic localization guided by the mask and semantic alignment with prompts.

Result: On MVTec-AD and VisA, AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in producing high-quality, diverse anomaly images. When used for data augmentation, it improves anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: AnoStyler provides a practical, lightweight, zero-shot framework for generating realistic anomalies via style transfer, reducing data and compute requirements while boosting downstream detection.

Abstract: Anomaly generation has been widely explored to address the scarcity of anomaly images in real-world data. However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.

### [138] [SPAN: Spatial-Projection Alignment for Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06702)
*Yifan Wang,Yian Zhao,Fanqi Pu,Xiaochen Yang,Yang Tang,Xi Chen,Wenming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN introduces spatial-point and 3D-2D projection alignment with hierarchical task learning to enforce cross-attribute geometric consistency in monocular 3D detectors, yielding notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoupled 3D attribute prediction loses geometric collaboration constraints among center, depth, size, and orientation, causing spatial drift and projection misalignment that hurts accuracy.

Method: Two components: (i) Spatial Point Alignment adds an explicit global spatial constraint between predicted and ground-truth 3D boxes to reduce drift; (ii) 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures the 3D box projection tightly lies within the 2D detection box on the image plane. A Hierarchical Task Learning strategy progressively introduces these alignments as 3D attributes are refined to stabilize training.

Result: Framework is compatible with existing monocular 3D detectors and yields significant performance improvements according to extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SPAN effectively enforces cross-attribute geometric consistency via spatial and projection alignments and a staged learning schedule, offering a practical and general enhancement for monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Existing monocular 3D detectors typically tame the pronounced nonlinear regression of 3D bounding box through decoupled prediction paradigm, which employs multiple branches to estimate geometric center, depth, dimensions, and rotation angle separately. Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into any established monocular 3D detector and delivers significant performance improvements.

*Sicheng Yang,Zhaohu Xing,Haipeng Zhou,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A keypoint-based framework, K-Stain, improves virtual staining from H&E to IHC by using hierarchical keypoint detection, keypoint-aware generation, and keypoint-guided discrimination, integrating adjacent slices to enhance spatial fidelity, surpassing state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with tissue misalignment and underutilization of spatial context; robust spatial correspondence is needed to preserve structural details in synthesized IHC images.

Method: Three components: (1) Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) identifies robust keypoints in stain images; (2) Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) fuses keypoint information during generation; (3) Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) emphasizes spatial details in adversarial training; the model also leverages contextual information from adjacent slices to improve consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: Keypoint-based spatial and semantic reasoning enhances fidelity of synthesized IHC images; the framework demonstrates strong cross-slice consistency and potential applicability to other virtual staining tasks.

Abstract: Virtual staining offers a promising method for converting Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images into Immunohistochemical (IHC) images, eliminating the need for costly chemical processes. However, existing methods often struggle to utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices. To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to spatial details. Our approach leverages contextual information from adjacent slices, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent IHC images. Extensive experiments show that K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that integrating Mamba architecture for multi-cue fusion and boundary refinement yields scalable, high-performance mirror detection across video and image data, with strong generalization.

Abstract: Video mirror detection has received significant research attention, yet existing methods suffer from limited performance and robustness. These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map. Notably, this work marks the first successful application of the Mamba-based architecture in the field of mirror detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for video mirror detection on the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, on the most challenging and representative image-based mirror detection dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its robustness and generalizability.

### [141] [MRT: Learning Compact Representations with Mixed RWKV-Transformer for Extreme Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06717)
*Han Liu,Hengyu Man,Xingtao Wang,Wenrui Li,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) to encode images into compact 1-D latent codes by combining RWKV for global cross-window dependencies with Transformer blocks for local within-window redundancies, plus a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM); achieves state-of-the-art efficiency at very low bitrates and outperforms 2-D methods like GLC on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2-D latent representations from CNNs or Swin Transformers retain substantial spatial redundancy, limiting compression efficiency. A 1-D latent representation, learned via a mix of linear-attention RWKV and self-attention Transformer, can yield more compact codes and better rate-distortion performance.

Method: The approach partitions each image into fixed-size windows and uses RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows while Transformer blocks model local redundancies within each window. A hierarchical attention mechanism learns efficient 1-D representations. A dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) is designed to exploit the structure of MRT's intermediate 1-D latents to further improve compression. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the method, with MRT achieving high reconstruction quality at ultra-low bitrates (~0.02 bpp).

Result: The MRT framework consistently delivers superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bpp. On the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, MRT yields substantial bitrate savings over the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, with reported improvements of 43.75% and 30.59% in bitrate savings according to the DISTS metric.

Conclusion: MRT effectively learns compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating RWKV and Transformer components, augmented by the RWKV Compression Model. This architecture reduces spatial redundancy in 1-D latent space and achieves superior rate-distortion performance at ultra-low bitrates, indicating strong potential for future 1-D latent-space image compression research.

Abstract: Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.

*Zizhao Li,Zhengkang Xiang,Jiayang Ao,Joseph West,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REL introduces Relative Energy Learning for LiDAR OOD detection, using an energy-gap score between in-distribution and out-of-distribution logits, and a lightweight data augmentation (Point Raise) to synthesize anomalies. It achieves state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and STU, offering a scalable, principled approach for open-world autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection in 3D LiDAR is essential for safe autonomous driving. Existing approaches largely transfer from 2D to 3D with poor performance, struggle to separate rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false positives and overconfident failures. There is a need for robust, calibration-friendly OOD scoring and simple, scalable data augmentation to bridge the lack of OOD samples in training.

Method: Define a relative energy score by computing the gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits, providing a calibration-friendly OOD detector. Introduce Point Raise, a lightweight data synthesis strategy that perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without changing inliers, to simulate OOD during training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on SemanticKITTI and the STU benchmark shows REL consistently outperforms existing OOD methods by a large margin across scenes and metrics.

Conclusion: Modeling relative energy with simple synthetic outliers yields a principled, scalable framework for LiDAR OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving, addressing calibration and robustness challenges.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable autonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and unexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.

*Yuda Qiu,Zitong Xiao,Yiwei Zuo,Zisheng Ye,Weikai Chen,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarTex combines diffusion-based inpainting, GAN latent optimization, and diffusion repainting in a three-stage pipeline to reconstruct high-quality, topology-aligned facial textures from a single image; introduces TexHub, a dataset of 20k multi-style UV textures; claims state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models offer diverse texture generation but lack explicit UV/topology constraints; GANs provide a structured latent space for topology and style but struggle with diversity; there is a shortage of large, multi-style, UV-aligned texture datasets for stylized avatars.

Method: Three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline: (1) diffusion-based inpainting to complete missing texture regions; (2) GAN-based latent optimization to enforce style and structural consistency with topology; (3) diffusion-based repainting for fine details. TexHub, a high-resolution dataset of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV layouts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction, delivering topology-aligned, stylistically coherent textures from a single image; TexHub enables future research and training.

Conclusion: TexHub will be released upon publication; AvatarTex demonstrates effective integration of diffusion and GANs to produce high-quality, topology-consistent stylized and photorealistic facial textures, enabling richer avatar creation workflows.

Abstract: We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.

*Jianyu Qi,Ding Zou,Wenrui Yan,Rui Ma,Jiaxu Li,Zhijie Zheng,Zhiguo Yang,Rongchang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes difficulty-aware sampling for post-training Multimodal LLMs using two metrics (PISM and CMAB) and a hierarchical training framework (GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO). Evaluated on six benchmarks, GRPO with difficulty-stratified samples consistently outperforms SFT+GRPO, reducing or removing the need for supervised fine-tuning; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two gaps in existing post-training approaches for multimodal RL: (1) lack of quantitative difficulty metrics to screen samples for optimization, and (2) suboptimal methods that do not jointly optimize perception and reasoning.

Method: Introduce Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) to quantify sample hardness via systematic image degradation; introduce Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) to assess cross-modal interaction complexity through attention distribution. Build a hierarchical training framework supporting both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms and evaluate on six benchmark datasets.

Result: GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples consistently outperforms conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, demonstrating that strategic data sampling can improve accuracy and potentially obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware sampling is effective for improving post-training of Multimodal LLMs, enabling better joint perception-reasoning optimization and more data-efficient training; code to be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

*Shubham Agarwal,Subrata Mitra,Saud Iqbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Argus is a high-throughput text-to-image inference system that dynamically assigns prompts to different approximation levels to meet throughput targets while preserving image quality, reducing latency violations and increasing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are compute-bound and slow due to iterative denoising, making high-throughput serving with quality guarantees challenging. A large portion of prompts can be served with faster, approximated models, but calibration is needed per prompt to avoid quality loss.

Method: Argus selects the appropriate approximation strategy per prompt and switches between strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality constraints on a fixed-size cluster. It effectively calibrates approximation settings per prompt and assigns prompts to the chosen model/approximation to meet SLOs.

Result: Argus achieves 10x fewer latency SLO violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

Conclusion: Adaptive, per-prompt approximation with a mixed-strategy deployment can significantly improve throughput and quality for diffusion-based T2I inference on fixed resources.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have gained significant popularity. Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real rain in multi-view 3D scenes exhibits viewpoint-dependent rain appearance due to projection, and ambient brightness changes from cloud cover. Existing datasets miss these dynamics, hindering realistic training and evaluation of rain deraining and 3D reconstruction methods.

Method: Construct OmniRain3D to capture perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity. Propose REVR-GSNet, an end-to-end architecture that jointly performs recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and Gaussian Splatting (GS) guided rain elimination via alternating optimization, enabling faithful reconstruction from rain-degraded inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the realism of the dataset and the effectiveness of REVR-GSNet in deraining and recovering high-quality 3D scenes from rain-degraded multi-view images.

Conclusion: The dataset and method establish a foundation for future work in multi-view rain deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction, promoting more robust and realistic 3D perception under rain.

Abstract: Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.

### [148] [Otter: Mitigating Background Distractions of Wide-Angle Few-Shot Action Recognition with Enhanced RWKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06741)
*Wenbo Huang,Jinghui Zhang,Zhenghao Chen,Guang Li,Lei Zhang,Yang Cao,Fang Dong,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Otter introduces a RWKV-based framework for wide-angle few-shot action recognition that uses Compound Segmentation and Temporal Reconstruction to highlight subjects and restore temporal relations, achieving state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wide-angle FSAR suffers from background distractions and incomplete global context. Direct RWKV modeling struggles to spotlight subjects amid background and temporal relations degrade when frames share backgrounds.

Method: Proposes Otter with a Compound Segmentation Module (CSM) to emphasize key patches per frame, and a Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) embedded in temporal-enhanced prototype construction for bidirectional temporal scanning. A regular prototype is fused with a temporal-enhanced prototype to jointly strengthen subject emphasis and temporal modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, with additional validation on VideoBadminton for wide-angle FSAR.

Conclusion: Otter effectively mitigates background distractions and reconstructs temporal relations in wide-angle FSAR, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PointCubeNet, a novel multi-modal 3D understanding framework that achieves part-level reasoning without requiring any part annotations. PointCubeNet comprises global and local branches. The proposed local branch, structured into 3x3x3 local blocks, enables part-level analysis of point cloud sub-regions with the corresponding local text labels. Leveraging the proposed pseudo-labeling method and local loss function, PointCubeNet is effectively trained in an unsupervised manner. The experimental results demonstrate that understanding 3D object parts enhances the understanding of the overall 3D object. In addition, this is the first attempt to perform unsupervised 3D part-level reasoning and achieves reliable and meaningful results.

*Ji Li,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A PDHG-inspired Plug-and-Play method uses a time-dependent denoiser from flow-matching generative priors, enabling flexible l1/l2 data fidelities for robust image restoration, outperforming squared l2 in non-Gaussian noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend PnP methods beyond Gaussian-squared data fidelity by integrating flow-matching generative priors and enabling non-Gaussian noise robustness (Poisson, impulse) with an efficient PDHG-based algorithm.

Method: Replace the proximal operator with a time-dependent denoiser derived from a flow-matching generative model within a PDHG-inspired PnP framework. The algorithm handles both l1 and l2 fidelity terms, is memory-efficient, and accommodates a wide range of data-fidelity terms.

Result: The l1 and l2 fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared l2 loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise across denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating flow-matching priors into a PDHG-based PnP framework broadens the applicability of generative priors for imaging inverse problems, providing robustness to non-Gaussian noise and efficiency, with l1/l2 fidelities yielding improved performance over squared l2.

Abstract: Regularized optimization has been a classical approach to solving imaging inverse problems, where the regularization term enforces desirable properties of the unknown image. Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.

TL;DR: Med-SORA is a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CTs that uses RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to model one-to-many symptom-organ relations, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global features, achieving state-of-the-art 3D clinical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical multimodal models rely on simple one-to-one hard labels and 2D features, which oversimplify symptom-to-organ relationships and miss 3D anatomical context in CT images.

Method: RAG-based dataset construction; soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many symptom-organ relationships; a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global image features.

Result: Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.

Conclusion: This work is the first to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning, advancing the ability to perform 3D clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning. However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images. Med-SORA introduces RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global image features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning. Experimental results show that Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.

### [152] [CAST-LUT: Tokenizer-Guided HSV Look-Up Tables for Purple Flare Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06764)
*Pu Wang,Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Chen Wu,Zhihua Zhang,Youshan Zhang,Chenggang Shan,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled HSV-LUT network (CAST + HSV-LUT) corrects purple flare by independently adjusting Hue, Saturation, and Value via a two-stage architecture, leveraging a large HSV-based tokenizer and 1D-LUTs, trained on a new dataset with bespoke metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional purple flare correction relies on hand-crafted features and fixed priors, limiting flexibility; deep-learning approaches suffer from scarce paired data and color coupling between HSV channels. A decoupled, data-driven approach could provide flexible, channel-wise correction and better color fidelity around highlights.

Method: The model uses a two-stage pipeline. Stage 1: Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts RGB to HSV and independently encodes H and V into semantic tokens describing purple flare status. Stage 2: HSV-LUT module consumes these tokens to dynamically generate separate 1D-LUTs for H, S, and V, enabling independent, content-adaptive corrections. A large-scale purple flare dataset with new metrics and a task-specific loss is introduced for training and evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: Decoupling HSV channels with CAST and adaptive HSV-LUTs offers a flexible, data-driven solution to purple flare, mitigating color coupling and improving tone transitions and color fidelity around highlight regions; the approach is validated on a new large-scale dataset with tailored metrics.

Abstract: Purple flare, a diffuse chromatic aberration artifact commonly found around highlight areas, severely degrades the tone transition and color of the image. Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.

*Meijun Guo,Yongliang Shi,Caiyun Liu,Yixiao Feng,Ming Ma,Tinghai Yan,Weining Lu,Bin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for large outdoor scenes by using LiDAR-IMU priors integrated into COLMAP for pose estimation and applying normal vector constraints with effective rank regularization to Gaussian primitives, achieving faster pose optimization and better scene representation, verified on public and self-collected datasets; code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unstable pose estimation and representation distortion due to geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures.

Method: Leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide priors; integrate into COLMAP triangulation; bundle adjustment; enforce pixel-prior pose consistency; apply normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization on Gaussian primitives; optimize jointly with photometric loss.

Result: Pose optimization time reduced to one-third with maintained accuracy; scene representation outperforms conventional 3DGS; improved visualization and overall performance on weak/repetitive textures datasets; code/data will be released at given repo.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robustness and quality of 3DGS in challenging outdoor scenes by combining external pose priors with regularization constraints, achieving faster optimization and better map quality; enables more reliable digital asset creation in challenging environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance. Codes and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/justinyeah/normal_shape.git.

*Bartłomiej Baranowski,Stefano Esposito,Patricia Gschoßmann,Anpei Chen,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConeGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by image-space-informed densification that places new Gaussians along viewing cones at depths predicted by a fast iNGP proxy, with an opacity penalty to prune redundancies and a primitive budget to control complexity, yielding better reconstructions especially under tight budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the poor spatial distribution of primitive Gaussians in 3D Gaussian Splatting caused by cloning-based densification, which limits exploration and requires many primitives.

Method: 1) Use a fast iNGP reconstruction to estimate per-pixel depth as a geometric proxy. 2) Identify high-error pixels and insert new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at predicted depths, initializing Gaussian sizes based on the cone diameter. 3) Apply a pre-activation opacity penalty to prune redundant Gaussians. 4) Use a primitive budgeting strategy (fixed budget or scene-adaptive) to cap total primitives.

Result: ConeGS yields consistent improvements in reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially large gains when the primitive budget is tight, due to more efficient Gaussian placement.

Conclusion: Image-space-informed densification via cone-based insertion, opacity-based pruning, and budgeting accelerates and improves 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it more efficient and effective under limited primitives.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.

### [155] [TiS-TSL: Image-Label Supervised Surgical Video Stereo Matching via Time-Switchable Teacher-Student Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06817)
*Rui Wang,Ying Zhou,Hao Wang,Wenwei Zhang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiS-TSL is a time-switchable teacher-student framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. It blends image-prediction, forward-video-prediction, and backward-video-prediction modes within a unified model, using a two-stage I2V then V2V learning to enforce bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. It outperforms image-based state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, with TEPE and EPE improvements of at least 2.11% and 4.54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense disparity supervision is impractical in minimally invasive surgery due to anatomical constraints. Existing teacher-student approaches rely on sparse image-level labels and lack temporal consistency, causing unstable disparities and flickering in video. There is a need for spatio-temporally reliable pseudo-labels and coherence in video stereo matching under sparse supervision.

Method: TiS-TSL introduces a unified model with three modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP). It uses a two-stage learning pipeline: (1) Image-to-Video (I2V) transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling; (2) Video-to-Video (V2V) refines temporal disparities by comparing forward and backward predictions to compute bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency, which filters unreliable pseudo labels and enforces temporal coherence.

Result: On two public datasets, TiS-TSL outperforms image-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of at least 2.11% in TEPE and 4.54% in EPE.

Conclusion: TiS-TSL delivers more reliable and temporally coherent disparity predictions under minimal supervision by enforcing bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency, mitigating flickering and unstable predictions, and achieving strong performance gains over image-based methods.

Abstract: Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..

### [156] [Integrating Reweighted Least Squares with Plug-and-Play Diffusion Priors for Noisy Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06823)
*Ji Li,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play restoration framework uses generative diffusion priors within MAP optimization to handle non-Gaussian noise (e.g., impulse noise), employing an IRLS scheme with a diffusion-based proximal step for robust restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend plug-and-play denoising from Gaussian models to non-Gaussian noise, addressing impulse noise where traditional least-squares data terms underperform.

Method: Adopt a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss in the MAP data term, yielding an l_q fidelity (0<q≤2); solve via iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS); perform the proximal step with a diffusion-based denoiser acting as the generative prior.

Result: On benchmark datasets, the method effectively removes impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diffusion priors enable robust plug-and-play restoration under diverse noise types; IRLS with a diffusion-based proximal step provides an effective optimization strategy for non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Existing plug-and-play image restoration methods typically employ off-the-shelf Gaussian denoisers as proximal operators within classical optimization frameworks based on variable splitting. Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual quality assessment of GS-based 3D reconstructions is an open challenge. Existing metrics may not reflect real human viewing experiences, and evaluations should be robust to real-world data uncertainties.

Method: Introduce a unified multi-distance subjective testing protocol that mimics human viewing for GS-based reconstructions; construct the MUGSQA dataset considering uncertainties in input data (quantity and resolution of input views, view distance, initial point cloud accuracy); design two benchmarks: one evaluating robustness of GS-based reconstructions under multiple uncertainties, and another evaluating performance of existing quality assessment metrics.

Result: Presents a perceptual evaluation protocol, the MUGSQA dataset, and two benchmarks to enable standardized perceptual assessment and robust evaluation of GS-based reconstructions; dataset and benchmark code to be released soon.

Conclusion: The work provides standardized perceptual evaluation resources for GS-based reconstructions, enabling fair comparisons across methods under real-world uncertainties and supporting the development of perceptually-guided improvements.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.

*Zhenjie Liu,Jianzhang Lu,Renjie Lu,Cong Liang,Shangfei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConsistTalk introduces an intensity-controllable, temporally consistent talking head generation framework using diffusion models, featuring an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT), an Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model via multimodal teacher-student distillation, and a diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init) to reduce flicker, preserve identity, and improve audio-visual synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion-based talking head methods suffer from flicker, identity drift, and poor synchronization due to entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference. There is a need for decoupled motion-appearance modeling, controllable dynamics, and stable inference.

Method: Proposes OFT to decouple motion from static appearance using optical flow; A2I model learned via multimodal teacher-student distillation to map audio and facial velocity into a frame-wise intensity sequence for joint modeling; IC-Init diffusion noise initialization strategy to constrain background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search; overall diffusion-noise search inference.

Result: Empirical results show ConsistTalk outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: ConsistTalk demonstrates that decoupled motion-appearance representations and controlled diffusion noise can substantially improve audio-driven talking head generation, enabling finer motion control and better synchronization while preserving identity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced audio-driven portrait animation. However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

*Wenjiang Zhang,Sifeng Wang,Yuwei Su,Xinyu Li,Chen Zhang,Suyu Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised cross-modal framework, NeuroBridge, uses Cognitive Prior Augmentation and a Shared Semantic Projector to align EEG and visual stimuli for neural visual decoding, achieving state-of-the-art intra-subject performance on a 200-way zero-shot task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain pairs and a semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Biological perceptual variability and co-adaptive processing motivate a robust cross-modal alignment strategy.

Method: Cognitive Prior Augmentation applies asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to EEG and images to simulate perceptual variability, while the Shared Semantic Projector enables a bidirectional, co-adaptive alignment that maps both modalities into a shared semantic space for cross-modal learning.

Result: NeuroBridge surpasses prior state-of-the-art in both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. Intra-subject gains include +12.3% top-1 accuracy and +10.2% top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% top-1 and 89.9% top-5 on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective, robust, and scalable neural visual decoding, with potential impacts on brain-computer interfaces and AI by enabling better cross-modal understanding between brain activity and visual stimuli.

Abstract: Visual neural decoding seeks to reconstruct or infer perceived visual stimuli from brain activity patterns, providing critical insights into human cognition and enabling transformative applications in brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence. Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual decoding.

Result: AS-DiffMPM demonstrates compatibility with various view synthesis methods as a framework for system identification from visual observations and enables physical property estimation with arbitrarily shaped colliders.

Conclusion: Extends differentiable MPM to arbitrarily shaped colliders, enhancing realism and applicability in system identification from videos in robotics and graphics.

Abstract: System identification involving the geometry, appearance, and physical properties from video observations is a challenging task with applications in robotics and graphics. Recent approaches have relied on fully differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and rendering for simultaneous optimization of these properties. However, they are limited to simplified object-environment interactions with planar colliders and fail in more challenging scenarios where objects collide with non-planar surfaces. We propose AS-DiffMPM, a differentiable MPM framework that enables physical property estimation with arbitrarily shaped colliders. Our approach extends existing methods by incorporating a differentiable collision handling mechanism, allowing the target object to interact with complex rigid bodies while maintaining end-to-end optimization. We show AS-DiffMPM can be easily interfaced with various novel view synthesis methods as a framework for system identification from visual observations.

TL;DR: Feature-based distillation can harm ViTs due to a representational mismatch; successful transfer requires strategies beyond naive feature mimicry that respect ViT's frequency and capacity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why feature-based knowledge distillation fails for Vision Transformers and provide theoretical guidance for designing effective ViT compression methods.

Method: Propose 'distillation dynamics', an analytical framework combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking to study KD behavior in ViTs; reveal a U-shaped information processing pattern and a mismatch between teacher's high-dimensional encodings and the student's limited channel capacity.

Result: Identify root cause of negative transfer as representational paradigm mismatch; late-layer feature alignment by KD can harm performance; establish that effective transfer requires methods that respect representational constraints; provide source code and logs.

Conclusion: Naive feature mimicry is insufficient for ViT compression; theoretical guidance suggests designing KD methods that align with ViT’s distributed encoding and capacity constraints.

Abstract: While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies. All source code and experimental logs are provided in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: ATFM presents Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching for AMIS, introducing Data-Hierarchical Inference, Gaussian Truncation Representation, and Segmentation Flow Matching to improve accuracy and diversity with efficient inference, achieving state-of-the-art metrics on LIDC and ISIC3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) faces a persistent trade-off between accuracy and prediction diversity. Existing truncated diffusion probabilistic models entangle fidelity and diversity, limiting practical performance. This work proposes a holistic approach to disentangle and enhance both aspects by rethinking inference, modeling, and flow-based segmentation.

Method: Data-Hierarchical Inference redefines AMIS-specific inference to boost data-distribution accuracy and per-sample diversity. Gaussian Truncation Representation models the truncation distribution as a Gaussian at the truncation horizon T_trunc, improving fidelity and truncation reliability over sampling-based methods. Segmentation Flow Matching extends semantic-aware flow transformation from Flow Matching to boost the plausibility of diverse predictions. These components are combined in ATFM and evaluated on LIDC and ISIC3.

Result: ATFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on AMIS benchmarks LIDC and ISIC3, with improved GED and HM-IoU by up to 12% and 7.3%, respectively, and exhibits more efficient inference.

Conclusion: ATFM provides a cohesive framework for disentangling accuracy and diversity in AMIS, delivering enhanced fidelity, plausibility, and efficiency. The introduced Data-Hierarchical Inference, Gaussian Truncation Representation, and Segmentation Flow Matching collectively advance the state-of-the-art in AMIS.

Abstract: A simultaneous enhancement of accuracy and diversity of predictions remains a challenge in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) due to the inherent trade-offs. While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new VQ-based generative framework, VAEVQ, improves codeword usage and cross-domain coherence by replacing AE with a VAE for latent quantization, and adding adaptive coherence and distribution regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address non-smooth latent spaces, misalignment between pre- and post-quantization representations, and poor coherence between continuous and discrete domains in VQ-based pipelines, which lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, hurting reconstruction and generation.

Method: Three components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ) replaces AE with a VAE for smoother, structured latent spaces to enhance codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS) adaptively modulates alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to improve consistency and avoid overfitting to noise; (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR) aligns the codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve codebook utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed VLQ-RCS-DCR framework improves codeword utilization, coherence between domains, and overall generation quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of variational latent quantization and distribution alignment in VQ-based models.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) transforms continuous image features into discrete representations, providing compressed, tokenized inputs for generative models. However, VQ-based frameworks suffer from several issues, such as non-smooth latent spaces, weak alignment between representations before and after quantization, and poor coherence between the continuous and discrete domains. These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Open-source text-to-image model trained on long captions with fine-grained attributes, using DimFusion and TaBR to improve controllability and expressiveness; results show top prompt alignment among open models; weights released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image systems rely on short prompts, leading to limited controllability and bias toward average preferences. Long, structured captions with consistent attribute annotations promise disjoint control over visual factors and richer outputs, addressing a gap between input and output detail.

Method: Train on long structured captions with uniform attribute annotations; introduce DimFusion to fuse intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length; propose TaBR evaluation by reconstructing real images via a captioning-generation loop to measure controllability for long captions.

Result: Train the large model FIBO achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models; public release of model weights on HuggingFace.

Conclusion: Long-caption training with controlled attributes and DimFusion/TaBR substantially improves controllability and expressiveness in open-source T2I models, enabling more precise professional use and setting a new evaluation standard.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have rapidly evolved from casual creative tools to professional-grade systems, achieving unprecedented levels of image quality and realism. Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

### [165] [A Two-Stage System for Layout-Controlled Image Generation using Large Language Models and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06888)
*Jan-Hendrik Koch,Jonas Krumme,Konrad Gadzicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled two-stage text-to-image pipeline—LLM-driven layout planning followed by a layout-conditioned diffusion model—enables precise object counts and spatial arrangements in generated images, with object recall dramatically improved (57.2% to 99.9%), and a trade-off between ControlNet (textual control but more hallucination) and GLIGEN (layout fidelity but less prompt controllability) after domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle to enforce exact object counts and spatial layouts, limiting compositional control. A modular approach could separate spatial planning from image synthesis to improve recall and fidelity.

Method: Stage 1: Use an LLM to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. Stage 2: Use a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to the layout. Improve recall by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion. Compare two conditioning methods—ControlNet and GLIGEN—after domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets.

Result: The approach yields high object recall (increasing from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes) and a viable end-to-end system that produces images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements. ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination; GLIGEN offers superior layout fidelity but reduced prompt-based controllability.

Conclusion: A decoupled planning-and-synthesis architecture is viable for compositionally controlled image synthesis. The choice between ControlNet and GLIGEN involves a trade-off between prompt controllability and layout fidelity; overall, the method demonstrates robust, controllable generation by separating spatial planning from image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but lack precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements. This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.

TL;DR: Adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT) for aortic vascular segmentation uses morphology-aware patching and Semantic Clustering Attention to preserve vascular structure and achieve state-of-the-art results on AVT, AortaSeg24, and TBAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in transformer-based models disrupt complex vascular geometries; morphology-aware partitioning and semantically-guided aggregation are needed to maintain structure integrity and segment vessels of varying sizes.

Method: Proposes adaptive patch partitioning that aligns patches with vascular morphology; introduces Semantic Clustering Attention to dynamically aggregate features from patches with similar semantics; evaluated on three open datasets (AVT, AortaSeg24, TBAD).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with notable improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures across datasets.

Conclusion: MPT effectively preserves semantic integrity of vascular structures and improves segmentation accuracy, indicating potential clinical impact for diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of aortic vascular structures is critical for diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases.Traditional Transformer-based models have shown promise in this domain by capturing long-range dependencies between vascular features. However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on three open-source dataset(AVT, AortaSeg24 and TBAD) demonstrate that MPT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reflection-based, polarization-sensitive in-situ CNN approach classifies colorless microplastics (50–300 μm) in water with ~80% peak mean accuracy across HDPE, LDPE, PP; AOLP robustness and better discrimination for polyethylene types; DOLP excels at PP; method mitigates transmission interference and emphasizes interior texture/polarization patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for continuous, large-scale microplastic monitoring in aquatic environments where transmission-based methods fail; overcome interference from water while remaining scalable.

Method: Illumination with linearly polarized laser; capture reflected signals with polarization-sensitive camera; train deep CNN on image data; perform feature hierarchy analysis; compare AOLP vs DOLP polarization signals; test dataset.

Result: 80% peak mean accuracy; AOLP robust to contextual noise; AOLP superior for distinguishing HDPE vs LDPE; DOLP slightly worse overall but better for identifying PP.

Conclusion: Reflection-based polarization sensing is a promising approach for in-situ microplastic monitoring; polarization features capture microstructure/texture; potential for real-world deployment; requires further validation with broader polymer types and real-water conditions.

Abstract: Facing the critical need for continuous, large-scale microplastic monitoring, which is hindered by the limitations of gold-standard methods in aquatic environments, this paper introduces and validates a novel, reflection-based approach for the in-situ classification and identification of microplastics directly in water bodies, which is based on polarized light scattering. In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $μ$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Zhaoyang Li,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Erbo Zhai,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mono3DVG-EnSD introduces CLIP-LCA and D2M to address two key issues in Mono3DVG: (1) over-reliance on high-certainty keywords and insufficient spatial descriptions, and (2) cross-dimensional interference from generalized textual features. It achieves SOTA on Mono3DRefer, notably +13.54% in Far(Acc@0.5).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mono3DVG methods over-emphasize explicit target keywords and neglect spatial cues, while generalized text blends 2D/3D information causing cross-dimensional interference during visual refinement.

Method: (CLIP-LCA) Dynamically masks high-certainty keywords to emphasize implicit spatial descriptions; (D2M) Decouples 2D/3D textual features from generalized text to guide corresponding visual features at the same dimension, reducing cross-dimensional interference.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Mono3DRefer, with substantial gains in challenging Far(Acc@0.5) metrics (+13.54%).

Conclusion: The proposed CLIP-LCA and D2M components jointly improve spatial reasoning and dimension-consistent cross-modal interactions, yielding robust improvements across metrics.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Visual Grounding (Mono3DVG) is an emerging task that locates 3D objects in RGB images using text descriptions with geometric cues. However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. Notably, it improves the challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario by a significant +13.54%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTTNet for video shadow detection integrates vision-language priors via a Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and a Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB) to disambiguate shadows from dark objects, uses adaptive mask reweighting and edge masks for better supervision, and introduces a Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) to efficiently model cross-frame shadow dynamics; achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time inference; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shadow-background ambiguity and dynamic shadow deformations under varying illumination are the core challenges in video shadow detection. The authors seek to leverage cross-modal (vision-language) cues to distinguish shadows from dark objects and design an efficient temporal module to model varying shadow shapes across frames.

Method: The approach combines: (1) Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB) to extract text-guided features to separate shadows from dark objects; (2) adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training; (3) edge masks applied at the final decoder stage for stronger supervision; (4) Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) that decouples spatiotemporal learning by summarizing cross-frame shadow semantics into learnable temporal tokens for efficient sequence encoding.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets report state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DTTNet effectively addresses both spatial shadow-background ambiguity and temporal deformation of shadows, achieving superior performance with efficient computation; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Video shadow detection confronts two entwined difficulties: distinguishing shadows from complex backgrounds and modeling dynamic shadow deformations under varying illumination. To address shadow-background ambiguity, we leverage linguistic priors through the proposed Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and a Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB), extracting text-guided features to explicitly differentiate shadows from dark objects. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training and apply edge masks at the final decoder stage for better supervision. For temporal modeling of variable shadow shapes, we propose a Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) that decouples spatiotemporal learning. TTB summarizes cross-frame shadow semantics into learnable temporal tokens, enabling efficient sequence encoding with minimal computation overhead. Comprehensive Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference efficiency. Codes are available at https://github.com/city-cheng/DTTNet.

TL;DR: A multi-modal, uncertainty-aware deep learning framework called PlantTraitNet uses citizen-science plant photos to predict four plant traits (height, leaf area, specific leaf area, nitrogen content) and produce global trait maps, outperforming existing products and validated against independent surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of field-based trait measurements (cost and sparse coverage) by leveraging the vast, geotagged citizen-science image datasets to generate scalable global trait maps for ecosystem and Earth system modeling.

Method: A multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework (PlantTraitNet) that uses weak supervision to predict four traits from citizen-science images, aggregates predictions spatially to generate global trait maps, and validates against independent data (sPlotOpen) and benchmarks against leading global trait products.

Result: PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing global trait maps for all four traits, yielding more accurate, scalable global trait distributions that align with independent survey data.

Conclusion: Citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables scalable and more accurate global trait mapping, offering a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.

Abstract: Global plant maps of plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen or plant height, are essential for understanding ecosystem processes, including the carbon and energy cycles of the Earth system. However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping. This approach offers a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.

TL;DR: ALIGN jointly trains a classifier and a masker to generate soft, task-relevant masks and align saliency with masks, using high-quality mask guidance to improve accuracy and explanations across domain generalization benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External or heuristic explanations are often noisy and hard to scale; low-quality supervision can degrade performance. There is a need for high-quality, scalable guidance to improve interpretability and generalization.

Method: Iterative joint training of a classifier and a masker. The masker learns soft masks highlighting informative regions; the classifier is optimized for both predictive accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. High-quality masks guide the process to improve explanation quality and generalization.

Result: ALIGN outperforms six strong baselines on VLCS and Terra Incognita in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, and yields superior explanation quality in terms of sufficiency and comprehensiveness.

Conclusion: ALIGN demonstrates that high-quality guidance for explanation-guided learning can enhance both predictive performance and interpretability, offering a scalable approach for domain generalization.

Abstract: Explanation-guided learning (EGL) has shown promise in aligning model predictions with interpretable reasoning, particularly in computer vision tasks. However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCLIP introduces a feature-space misalignment framework to fool CLIP-based image quality metrics, using feature alignment, score distribution balance, and pixel-guard regularization; it achieves higher CLIPscore with preserved visual fidelity, reveals grayscale as a vulnerability, and proposes a color-channel tampering detector with ~91% accuracy; highlights vulnerability and a defense path for CLIP multimodal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-based metrics rely on cross-modal alignment and may be vulnerable to feature-space misalignment; understanding attack surfaces is crucial for the reliability of multimodal image quality assessment and for developing defenses.

Method: Stochastic gradient descent-based optimization with three modules: (1) feature alignment core to reduce image-text modality gaps, (2) score distribution balance to harmonize outputs across prompts, and (3) pixel-guard regularization to constrain perturbations; experiments include ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets; also analyzes grayscale conversion effects and proposes a color-channel sensitivity-based tampering detector.

Result: Optimized images show significant CLIPscore gains while maintaining high visual fidelity; grayscale conversion causes notable feature degradation and CLIPscore drop despite preserved statistical similarity; the proposed tampering detector based on color-channel sensitivity achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and presents a defense method; suggests the need for robust evaluation and defenses against multimodal adversarial tactics.

Abstract: The well-aligned attribute of CLIP-based models enables its effective application like CLIPscore as a widely adopted image quality assessment metric. However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.

TL;DR: CT-free attenuation correction for cardiac SPECT using a diffusion model with physics priors (PADM) and teacher-student distillation; trained on NAC inputs; introduces CardiAC dataset (424 studies) with NAC, AC reconstructions, and CT-based attenuation maps; shows improved fidelity over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based attenuation correction reduces artifacts but introduces cost, radiation, and accessibility barriers. A CT-free solution could democratize attenuation correction in myocardial perfusion imaging.

Method: Propose Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative model incorporating physics priors via a teacher–student distillation framework. Train with NAC inputs while leveraging physics-informed supervision from AC maps; at inference, operate solely on NAC data. Introduce CardiAC dataset with 424 patient studies containing paired NAC and AC reconstructions plus high-res CT maps.

Result: PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity across quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Conclusion: A feasible, CT-free attenuation correction approach for cardiac SPECT that can enhance diagnostic interpretability and accessibility. The CardiAC dataset supports broader research and benchmarking in CT-free attenuation correction for MPI.

Abstract: Attenuation artifacts remain a significant challenge in cardiac Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) using Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), often compromising diagnostic accuracy and reducing clinical interpretability. While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment.

TL;DR: Proposes GFix, a content-adaptive diffusion-based enhancer for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) video compression. Uses a single-step diffusion model as an off-the-shelf enhancer and a modulated LoRA to efficiently adapt the backbone, achieving notable perceptual improvements and better compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS-based video codecs show artifacts and limited compression ratios; perceptual quality is crucial. The work aims to mitigate artifacts and boost compression efficiency by treating rendering/quantization artifacts as noisy latents from diffusion training.

Method: A streamlined, single-step diffusion model acts as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Introduces a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes low-rank decompositions and modulates intermediate hidden states to enable efficient adaptation with compressible updates.

Result: GFix achieves strong perceptual quality improvements, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

Conclusion: Content-adaptive diffusion-based enhancement with a compact, efficiently adaptable backbone can substantially improve perceptual quality and compression efficiency in 3DGS-based video codecs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhances 3D scene reconstruction through explicit representation and fast rendering, demonstrating potential benefits for various low-level vision tasks, including video compression. However, existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

TL;DR: A wavelet-informed, two-stage patch selection for MAE pretraining on whole-slide images (WISE-MAE) improves structure-aware representations with efficient, weakly-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MAE pretraining on whole-slide images often samples noisy or irrelevant patches due to the extreme size and limited annotations. There is a need for a guided, domain-adapted sampling strategy that emphasizes tissue structure and mirrors pathologist workflows to improve representation quality.

Method: WISE-MAE uses a two-step coarse-to-fine approach. First, at low magnification, wavelet-based screening identifies structurally rich regions. Then, high-resolution patches are extracted from these regions for MAE pretraining with a Vision Transformer backbone. The framework is lightweight and domain-adapted to histopathology, aiming to improve meaningful pattern capture while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.

Result: Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets (lung, renal, colorectal) show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while remaining efficient under weak supervision.

Conclusion: WISE-MAE demonstrates that incorporating wavelet-based, structure-aware patch selection into MAE pretraining yields more biologically meaningful representations, improves efficiency, and aligns with the diagnostic workflow. This approach offers a promising direction for self-supervised learning on whole-slide histopathology images, with potential for broader generalization and future refinements.

Abstract: Whole-slide images are central to digital pathology, yet their extreme size and scarce annotations make self-supervised learning essential. Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.

TL;DR: Introducing TrueCity, a synchronized real-and-simulated urban 3D semantic segmentation benchmark that quantifies the sim-to-real domain gap and enables evaluation of synthetic data in real-world scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world annotated 3D data are scarce and synthetic data, while scalable and perfectly labeled, fails to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, creating a synthetic-to-real domain gap. There is no benchmark with synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-domain shift analysis.

Method: Introduce TrueCity: a dataset with cm-accurate real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and matched simulated point clouds of the same city; align segmentation classes with international 3D city modeling standards; perform extensive baselines to quantify domain shift and explore strategies to leverage synthetic data for real-world 3D scene understanding; release data/code/models online.

Result: First urban semantic segmentation benchmark with synchronized real and simulated data, enabling quantified analysis of sim-to-real gaps; baseline experiments quantify domain shift and guide strategies to use synthetic data for real-world understanding.

Conclusion: TrueCity will spur quantification of sim-to-real gaps and support the development of generalizable, data-driven 3D scene understanding models; dataset and resources are publicly available to foster further research.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models. The data, code, and 3D models are available online: https://tum-gis.github.io/TrueCity/

### [178] [Performance Decay in Deepfake Detection: The Limitations of Training on Outdated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07009)
*Jack Richings,Margaux Leblanc,Ian Groves,Victoria Nockles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage deepfake detector achieves very high AUROC on current deepfakes but rapidly loses effectiveness to newer generation methods; robust detection requires ongoing data collection and frame-level feature detectors rather than temporal cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake threats are evolving rapidly; detectors trained on current data tend to degrade as generation techniques change, necessitating understanding of decay patterns and robust development directions.

Method: Introduce a simple two-stage detection approach; train on large, diverse datasets; evaluate on contemporary deepfakes and on deepfakes created six months later to assess generalization; analyze whether predictive power comes from static frame-level artifacts vs temporal cues; emphasize rapid data collection and frame-level detectors.

Result: AUROC >99.8% on contemporary deepfakes; recall drops by over 30% when evaluated on six-month-later deepfakes; robustness hinges on continual data curation and frame-level artifacts as the primary drivers of detection.

Conclusion: Sustained deepfake detection performance requires ongoing, diverse data collection and development of advanced frame-level detectors; focusing on frame-level artifacts provides a more robust basis than relying on temporal inconsistencies, with rapid data updates essential to keep pace with evolving threats.

Abstract: The continually advancing quality of deepfake technology exacerbates the threats of disinformation, fraud, and harassment by making maliciously-generated synthetic content increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. We introduce a simple yet effective two-stage detection method that achieves an AUROC of over 99.8% on contemporary deepfakes. However, this high performance is short-lived. We show that models trained on this data suffer a recall drop of over 30% when evaluated on deepfakes created with generation techniques from just six months later, demonstrating significant decay as threats evolve. Our analysis reveals two key insights for robust detection. Firstly, continued performance requires the ongoing curation of large, diverse datasets. Second, predictive power comes primarily from static, frame-level artifacts, not temporal inconsistencies. The future of effective deepfake detection therefore depends on rapid data collection and the development of advanced frame-level feature detectors.

### [179] [Certified L2-Norm Robustness of 3D Point Cloud Recognition in the Frequency Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07029)
*Liang Zhou,Qiming Wang,Tianze Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqCert certifies 3D point cloud classifiers against global L2 perturbations by transforming to the frequency domain with GFT, applying spectral subsampling to create sub-clouds, and majority-voting; it provides a closed-form robust radius bound and shows empirical and certified gains on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured geometric distortions that preserve individual points but alter the overall structure. Existing defenses focus on point-wise perturbations and overlook these global, structured attacks, motivating a frequency-domain certification approach.

Method: Apply graph Fourier transform (GFT) to input point clouds, perform spectral similarity-based subsampling to generate multiple sub-clouds, classify each sub-cloud with a standard model, and aggregate via majority voting. The partitioning is designed to be stable under L2 perturbations and aligned with intrinsic object structure. Derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal, interpretable assumptions.

Result: Demonstrates higher certified accuracy and stronger empirical accuracy under perturbations on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, validating the effectiveness of frequency-domain certification for 3D point clouds.

Conclusion: Spectral representations enable effective certifiable robustness for 3D point cloud recognition, offering a principled pathway beyond traditional spatial-domain defenses.

Abstract: 3D point cloud classification is a fundamental task in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest that spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable robustness in 3D point cloud recognition.

### [180] [3D-ANC: Adaptive Neural Collapse for Robust 3D Point Cloud Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07040)
*Yuanmin Huang,Wenxuan Li,Mi Zhang,Xiaohan Zhang,Xiaoyu You,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D-ANC proposes an ETF-based, Neural Collapse–driven framework to improve robustness of 3D point cloud models against adversarial perturbations by disentangling feature spaces through representation-balanced learning and dynamic feature direction loss, achieving substantial gains (e.g., DGCNN on ModelNet40: 27.2%→80.9%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks exploit entangled feature spaces in 3D point clouds; existing defenses struggle with evolving attack patterns, especially under class imbalance and geometric similarity across categories.

Method: Introduce an ETF-aligned classification module guided by Neural Collapse, and an adaptive training framework combining representation-balanced learning (RBL) with dynamic feature direction loss (FDL) to produce disentangled, maximally separable class prototypes.

Result: The approach yields strong robustness improvements across models and datasets; notable improvement on ModelNet40 (DGCNN: 27.2% to 80.9%), surpassing baselines by a wide margin; tested on two datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging Neural Collapse to form an ETF-structured feature space enables robust 3D recognition with existing architectures, even under significant data imbalance and geometric similarity.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.

### [181] [From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07049)
*Hui Lu,Yi Yu,Song Xia,Yiming Yang,Deepu Rajan,Boon Poh Ng,Alex Kot,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transferable Video Attack (TVA) is a practical, temporal-aware adversarial attack on open large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) that can compromise downstream models and MLLMs without needing the victim task, data, queries, or architectural access; it uses bidirectional contrastive learning and a temporal consistency loss to craft perturbations, showing efficacy across 24 video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-access VFMs pose security risks because adversaries can exploit their knowledge to attack downstream models without access to the victim task, data, or model internals. Traditional transfer attacks rely on domain-specific surrogates; this work seeks a more practical, data-free attack that leverages the temporal dynamics of VFMs.

Method: Introduce TVA (Transferable Video Attack), a temporal-aware adversarial method that exploits the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs. TVA uses a bidirectional contrastive learning objective to maximize the gap between clean and adversarial features and adds a temporal consistency loss that leverages motion cues to amplify perturbation impact over time. Importantly, TVA does not require training surrogate models or domain-specific data.

Result: Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate TVA’s effectiveness against downstream models and MLLMs, exposing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in open VFMs.

Conclusion: TVA reveals a practical and efficient attack vector against open Video Foundation Models and their downstream deployments, underscoring the need for robust defenses and prompting future work on mitigation strategies for video-model security.

Abstract: Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.

### [182] [Improving Deepfake Detection with Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07051)
*Yuxuan Zhou,Tao Yu,Wen Huang,Yuheng Zhang,Tao Dai,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRDA introduces a curriculum reinforcement-learning data augmentation framework for deepfake detectors that dynamically crafts adversarial, diverse, and causally-informed augmentations, improving cross-domain generalization over static policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors struggle to generalize due to evolving, multi-domain forgery patterns. Fixed augmentation strategies fail to mimic real-world complexity and can embed task-irrelevant biases.

Method: An RL agent selects augmentation actions from a configurable pool of forgery operations based on the detector's performance, creating adversarial and heterogeneous patterns. It integrates causal inference to suppress spurious correlations, guiding the augmentation toward causally invariant features and employing a curriculum from simple to complex forgeries.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial gains in cross-domain generalization, beating state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic, curriculum-based augmentation that combines RL and causal inference yields robust detector generalization by exploring diverse, task-relevant forgery patterns while mitigating biases.

Abstract: The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.

### [183] [RaLD: Generating High-Resolution 3D Radar Point Clouds with Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07067)
*Ruijie Zhang,Bixin Zeng,Shengpeng Wang,Fuhui Zhou,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaLD uses a latent diffusion model to turn raw radar spectra into dense, accurate 3D point clouds by combining a LiDAR-informed frustum autoencoder, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar conditioning, addressing sparsity and resolution limits in radar 3D perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based 3D perception suffers from sparse, low-resolution point clouds; existing generative methods rely on dense voxel representations and struggle to preserve structural details, and there is a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies for latent diffusion models in radar 3D generation.

Method: Propose RaLD: (1) scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding to capture structure; (2) order-invariant latent representations to handle permutation variability; (3) direct conditioning on radar spectrum for diffusion-based generation; resulting in a compact, expressive generation process.

Result: Experiments show RaLD yields dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, demonstrating improved dense 3D reconstruction and robustness in challenging environments.

Conclusion: RaLD offers a promising and efficient solution for robust radar-based 3D perception in adverse conditions, bridging the gap between sparse radar data and dense, structured 3D outputs.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising sensing modality for autonomous systems thanks to its robustness in adverse conditions and low cost. However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClusterMine performs unsupervised OOD detection by mining positive concepts from large text corpora, removing the need for in-distribution labels, and achieves state-of-the-art results across CLIP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely on pre-defined in-distribution (ID) label names, which can be unavailable or unreliable at scale and may drift after deployment. There is a need for truly unsupervised OOD detection that does not depend on labeled positives.

Method: Introduce a general concept mining framework. ClusterMine extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) with zero-shot image-text consistency, enabling positive label mining without any labeled positives.

Result: ClusterMine achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection without access to positive labels. It scales across various CLIP models and shows robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts. Code is provided at the project URL.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that unsupervised OOD detection is feasible with CLIP by mining positive concepts from text data, yielding scalable and robust performance without labeled positives.

Abstract: Large-scale visual out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has witnessed remarkable progress by leveraging vision-language models such as CLIP. However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

### [185] [LeCoT: revisiting network architecture for two-view correspondence pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07078)
*Luanyuan Dai,Xiaoyu Du,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeCoT presents a two-view correspondence pruning network that leverages a Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer to capture global context without extra modules, plus a progressive prediction block that refines guidance; it achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple two-view tasks. Code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLP-based backbones for two-view correspondence pruning struggle to capture global spatial and channel context efficiently, often requiring ad-hoc modules. There is a need for an architecture that naturally exploits global context among sparse correspondences to improve pruning robustness and downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce LeCoT with a Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block that jointly encodes spatial and channel global context among sparse correspondences. Add a prediction block that uses intermediate-stage features to produce a probability set, which is progressively refined to guide subsequent learning and mitigate information loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in two-view correspondence pruning and downstream tasks, including relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: LeCoT demonstrates effective global-context utilization for robust two-view correspondence pruning without relying on extra context-design modules; the progressive prediction block enhances learning stability and information preservation. The authors release code for replication.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence pruning aims to accurately remove incorrect correspondences (outliers) from initial ones and is widely applied to various computer vision tasks. Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

It is accompanied by SimpleLidarLane, a light-weight baseline using BEV segmentation, clustering, and polyline fitting, and a new Interpolation-Aware Matching F1 (IAM-F1) metric for standardized evaluation; all data and code are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks large-scale, diverse LiDAR lane-detection data and standardized evaluation metrics. This work aims to enable robust perception across conditions, provide a simple yet competitive baseline, and establish a principled metric for comparison and reproducibility.

Method: Dataset collection with full calibration (intrinsics/extrinsics) and synchronized odometry for lane projection, fusion, and temporal modeling. SimpleLidarLane is a modular baseline that performs BEV segmentation, clustering, and polyline fitting to reconstruct lane lines. IAM-F1 is a polyline-based interpolation-aware metric for BEV-space evaluation.

Result: SimpleLidarLane demonstrates strong performance under challenging conditions (e.g., rain, sparse lidar returns), suggesting that modular pipelines can compete with more complex methods when data quality is high. IAM-F1 provides a standardized, interpolation-aware evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The data and code are publicly released to support reproducibility; Pandar128 establishes a new benchmark for LiDAR-based lane detection, with a simple yet effective baseline and a principled evaluation metric to standardize comparisons across methods.

Abstract: We present Pandar128, the largest public dataset for lane line detection using a 128-beam LiDAR. It contains over 52,000 camera frames and 34,000 LiDAR scans, captured in diverse real-world conditions in Germany. The dataset includes full sensor calibration (intrinsics, extrinsics) and synchronized odometry, supporting tasks such as projection, fusion, and temporal modeling.
  To complement the dataset, we also introduce SimpleLidarLane, a light-weight baseline method for lane line reconstruction that combines BEV segmentation, clustering, and polyline fitting. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves strong performance under challenging various conditions (e.g., rain, sparse returns), showing that modular pipelines paired with high-quality data and principled evaluation can compete with more complex approaches.
  Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation, we propose a novel polyline-based metric - Interpolation-Aware Matching F1 (IAM-F1) - that employs interpolation-aware lateral matching in BEV space.

### [187] [How Bias Binds: Measuring Hidden Associations for Bias Control in Text-to-Image Compositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07091)
*Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a bias adherence score and a training-free context-bias control framework to study semantic bindings in prompts. Shows that object–attribute associations amplify bias in text-to-image generation, achieving over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional tasks, and highlights challenges in removing bias without disrupting essential semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debiasing research largely targets single-object prompts and overlooks how semantic bindings between objects and attributes in prompts shape bias. The interaction between context and object/attribute choices can amplify or alter bias, necessitating investigation into semantically bound prompts.

Method: Proposes a bias adherence score to quantify how object–attribute bindings trigger bias. Develops a training-free context-bias control framework using token decoupling to probe how semantic bindings influence debiasing, enabling evaluation without additional training.

Result: Demonstrates that bias activation can be amplified by semantic bindings. The context-bias control framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Bias-score analyses across various attribute–object pairings and token decorrelation reveal a core challenge: debiasing without compromising essential semantic relations.

Conclusion: Current debiasing approaches have critical limitations when applied to semantically bound contexts. The work underscores the need to rethink bias mitigation strategies to account for semantic bindings in prompts.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models often exhibit bias related to sensitive attributes. However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt "an assistant wearing a pink hat" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.

*Sirui Wang,Jiang He,Natàlia Blasco Andreo,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware, wavelet-based diffusion framework (GEWDiff) for 4x hyperspectral image super-resolution that compresses HSIs into a latent space, preserves spectral-spatial fidelity, and stabilizes diffusion with a multi-level loss, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images are extremely high-dimensional and memory-intensive, making them difficult to handle with conventional diffusion models. Moreover, existing generative models often neglect the ground objects' geometric/topological structures in remote sensing, and noise-level loss can lead to unstable convergence and suboptimal results for complex data.

Method: A wavelet-based encoder–decoder compresses HSIs into a latent representation that preserves spectral–spatial information. A geometry-enhanced diffusion process is introduced to preserve geometric features during generation. A multi-level loss guides the diffusion process to promote stable convergence and higher reconstruction fidelity. The system targets 4x super-resolution and reports improvements across fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity on hyperspectral 4x super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: GEWDiff effectively reconstructs hyperspectral images with preserved spectral–spatial information and geometric structure, enabling robust 4x super-resolution and improved convergence stability for diffusion models.

Abstract: Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HENet/HENet++ introduce a multi-task 3D perception framework for autonomous driving using a hybrid image encoder (large for short-term frames, small for long-term frames) that also extracts both dense and sparse features to support diverse tasks and planning. It preserves compatibility with existing 3D feature methods and multimodal inputs, reporting state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task results and lowest collision rate on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve 3D perception for autonomous driving across multiple tasks (3D object detection, BEV segmentation, occupancy) while managing computational constraints; single-model end-to-end solutions struggle to balance accuracy across tasks due to differing optimal feature representations and high resource demands.

Method: A hybrid image encoding network that deploys a large encoder for short-term (high-quality) frames and a smaller one for long-term frames, and produces both dense and sparse features to suit different tasks; the framework is compatible with existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs, enabling end-to-end multi-task inference.

Result: HENet++ achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark and records the lowest collision rate on nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed HENet/HENet++ framework provides an efficient, multi-task-capable approach to 3D perception in autonomous driving, balancing feature quality and computational cost, improving planning reliability, and maintaining compatibility with existing 3D feature extraction methods.

Abstract: Three-dimensional feature extraction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, where perception tasks such as 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction serve as important constraints on 3D features. While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs. HENet++ achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, while also attaining the lowest collision rate on the nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.

*Changyue Shi,Chuxiao Yang,Xinyuan Hu,Minghao Chen,Wenwen Pan,Yan Yang,Jiajun Ding,Zhou Yu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse4DGS enables dynamic 4D scene reconstruction from sparse frames by texture-aware deformation regularization and canonical optimization, outperforming existing methods on several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense-frame dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods require dense video sequences; in real-world scenarios, data is often sparse due to equipment and capture constraints. There is a need to enable high-quality 4D reconstruction from sparse frames, especially in texture-rich regions where errors are pronounced.

Method: Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization: introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation in the deformation network. Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization: incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians in the Gaussian field.

Result: Extensive experiments show that with sparse frames, Sparse4DGS outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot approaches on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and the iPhone-4D datasets.

Conclusion: Presents the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction and demonstrates strong improvements in texture-rich areas, validating relevance for real-world sparse-data scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting approaches have achieved remarkable performance for 4D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches rely on dense-frame video sequences for photorealistic reconstruction. In real-world scenarios, due to equipment constraints, sometimes only sparse frames are accessible. In this paper, we propose Sparse4DGS, the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that when taking sparse frames as inputs, our method outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and our iPhone-4D datasets.

### [191] [MPJudge: Towards Perceptual Assessment of Music-Induced Paintings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07137)
*Shiqi Jiang,Tianyi Liang,Changbo Wang,Chenhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MPD, a large-scale perceptual-coherence dataset of music–painting pairs, and MPJudge, a model that fuses music features into a visual encoder using modulation and trains with Direct Preference Optimization to assess perceptual coherence between music and paintings, outperforming emotion-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating painting fidelity to its music is a perceptual task that current emotion-based methods inject noise and miss broader perceptual cues. A direct modeling of perceptual coherence is needed, along with mechanisms to handle ambiguity in such cross-modal judgments.

Method: Create MPD, a dataset of music–painting pairs annotated by domain experts for perceptual coherence; collect pairwise preferences for ambiguous cases. Develop MPJudge, which integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation-based fusion mechanism. Train using Direct Preference Optimization to learn from uncertain annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show MPJudge outperforms existing approaches; qualitative results indicate better localization of music-relevant regions in paintings.

Conclusion: The perceptual-coherence framing enables more accurate cross-modal alignment between music and visual art. The MPD dataset and MPJudge model provide a robust foundation for future research in music-induced painting assessment and related multimodal perception tasks.

Abstract: Music induced painting is a unique artistic practice, where visual artworks are created under the influence of music. Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations. Building on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism. To effectively learn from ambiguous cases, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Qualitative results further show that our model more accurately identifies music relevant regions in paintings.

*Xinyi Zhang,Daoyi Gao,Naiqi Li,Angela Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based procedural 3D generation framework (ProcGen3D) that uses edge-tokenized procedural graphs, a transformer prior conditioned on an RGB image, and Monte Carlo Tree Search guided sampling to produce image-faithful 3D assets, outperforming existing methods and generalizing from synthetic to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable controllable, image-aligned 3D asset creation by leveraging procedural generators, addressing limitations in existing image-based reconstruction and 3D generation methods, and improving generalization from synthetic training.

Method: Represent 3D assets as sequential procedural graphs with edge-based tokenization. Train a transformer prior to predict the next graph token conditioned on an input RGB image. Integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search guided sampling to steer outputs toward image-faithful reconstructions. Evaluate across objects renderable by procedural generators (e.g., cacti, trees, bridges).

Result: Neural procedural graph generation outperforms state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques. Demonstrates improved generalization to real-world input images despite training on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Procedural graphs, combined with image-conditioned transformers and MCTS, offer a powerful approach for 3D asset generation from images, enabling broad applicability to procedurally-generated object classes and better real-world generalization.

Abstract: We introduce ProcGen3D, a new approach for 3D content creation by generating procedural graph abstractions of 3D objects, which can then be decoded into rich, complex 3D assets. Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators. Extensive experiments on cacti, trees, and bridges show that our neural procedural graph generation outperforms both state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques. Furthermore, this enables improved generalization on real-world input images, despite training only on synthetic data.

*Sébastien Thuau,Siba Haidar,Rachid Chelouah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three federated violence-detection strategies are compared on non-IID data: zero-shot VLMs, LoRA-tuned VLMs, and personalized CNNs. A 3D CNN offers best energy efficiency and calibration, VLMs enable richer reasoning, and hierarchical grouping boosts VLM multiclass accuracy; a hybrid deployment favoring CNNs for routine tasks with VLMs for complex cases is recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving video surveillance under non-IID data, with environmental sustainability concerns. The study benchmarks the trade-offs between zero-shot VLM inference, LoRA-tuned VLMs, and personalized CNNs, providing energy and CO2e quantification to guide deployment choices.

Method: Evaluate three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: (1) zero-shot inference with pretrained vision-language models (VLMs); (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B; (3) personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. Metrics include binary violence detection accuracy, ROC AUC calibration, energy consumption (Wh), CO2e, and multiclass accuracy with hierarchical grouping on UCF-Crime.

Result: All methods exceed 90% accuracy for binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration with ROC AUC 92.59% at approximately 240 Wh, versus ~570 Wh for federated LoRA. VLMs offer richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping increases VLM multiclass accuracy on UCF-Crime from 65.31% to 81%. This is the first comparative simulation with explicit energy and CO2e quantification for LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs in federated violence detection.

Conclusion: Hybrid deployment is advisable: default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning, enabling privacy-preserving, energy-aware federated surveillance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based video surveillance increasingly demands privacy-preserving architectures with low computational and environmental overhead. Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification. Our results inform hybrid deployment strategies that default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning.

*Jiajie Lu,Zhenkan Fu,Na Zhao,Long Xing,Kejiang Chen,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteUpdate is a lightweight framework to keep AI-generated image detectors up-to-date with new generators by selective sample acquisition and multi-trajectory weight fusion, yielding notable gains with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI advances rapidly, detectors degrade in performance and suffer catastrophic forgetting during updates; there is a need for efficient, continual updating methods.

Method: Two components: (1) representative sample selection using image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples; (2) model merging/fusion that combines weights from pre-trained, representative, and random fine-tuning trajectories to balance adaptability and memory.

Result: On AIDE evaluating against Midjourney, average detection accuracy improved from 87.63% to 93.03% (6.16% relative increase).

Conclusion: LiteUpdate improves detection performance and update efficiency for detectors facing new generators, mitigating forgetting while preserving adaptability; shows strong gains across detectors.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has led to the emergence of new generative models, while existing detection methods struggle to keep pace, resulting in significant degradation in the detection performance. This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors. Specifically, on AIDE, the average detection accuracy on Midjourney improved from 87.63% to 93.03%, a 6.16% relative increase.

TL;DR: Automated deep learning pipeline estimates skull-base risk scores (Keros, Gera, TMS) from CT/CBCT by heatmap-based landmark localization; compares direct vs global-to-local learning; achieves MAEs: Keros 0.506 mm, Gera 4.516°, TMS 0.802 mm / 0.777 mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce time-consuming manual measurements in preoperative skull-base assessment to minimize risk of CSF leakage in endoscopic sinus surgery; standardize risk scoring.

Method: Heatmap-regression landmark localization within an automated pipeline; compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy for estimating Keros, Gera, and TMS scores.

Result: Mean absolute errors: Keros 0.506 mm; Gera 4.516°; TMS 0.802 mm / 0.777 mm; performance quantified on relevant anatomical measurements.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of automated score estimation from CT/CBCT; global-to-local strategy evaluated; potential to streamline preoperative planning, with need for broader validation and assessment of clinical impact.

Abstract: Endoscopic sinus surgery requires careful preoperative assessment of the skull base anatomy to minimize risks such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Anatomical risk scores like the Keros, Gera and Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore score offer a standardized approach but require time-consuming manual measurements on coronal CT or CBCT scans. We propose an automated deep learning pipeline that estimates these risk scores by localizing key anatomical landmarks via heatmap regression. We compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy and find mean absolute errors on the relevant anatomical measurements of 0.506mm for the Keros, 4.516° for the Gera and 0.802mm / 0.777mm for the TMS classification.

TL;DR: Survey of geometric INRs for learning signed distance functions to reconstruct surfaces from oriented point clouds or images, using differential-geometry-based regularization to enforce global properties like unit gradient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve 3D surface reconstruction by embedding geometric priors into neural implicit representations, leveraging normals and curvatures to regularize SDFs.

Method: Survey of INR definitions, geometric loss design (normals, curvature, unit gradient), sampling strategies informed by differential geometry, and their use for surface reconstruction from oriented point clouds and posed images.

Result: Identifies key components and notable advancements in geometric INRs for surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: Geometric INRs with differential-geometry–guided regularization provide a robust framework for surface reconstruction and point toward future integration of geometric priors and advanced sampling in neural implicit representations.

Abstract: \textit{Implicit neural representations} (INRs) have emerged as a promising framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces. This survey reviews the existing literature on the specialized INR problem of approximating \textit{signed distance functions} (SDFs) for surface scenes, using either oriented point clouds or a set of posed images. We refer to neural SDFs that incorporate differential geometry tools, such as normals and curvatures, in their loss functions as \textit{geometric} INRs. The key idea behind this 3D reconstruction approach is to include additional \textit{regularization} terms in the loss function, ensuring that the INR satisfies certain global properties that the function should hold -- such as having unit gradient in the case of SDFs. We explore key methodological components, including the definition of INR, the construction of geometric loss functions, and sampling schemes from a differential geometry perspective. Our review highlights the significant advancements enabled by geometric INRs in surface reconstruction from oriented point clouds and posed images.

*Binyan Xu,Fan Yang,Di Tang,Xilin Dai,Kehuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB) use a conditional InfoGAN to learn stealthy, naturally occurring triggers that enable backdoors with minimal poisoned data and CA degradation (<1%), across multiple datasets, architectures, and tasks including regression and segmentation; resilient to many defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stealthiness limitation of existing clean-image backdoors, which require higher poison rates and cause noticeable drops in Clean Accuracy (CA).

Method: Train a conditional InfoGAN to identify natural image features that can act as triggers; ensure the trigger is easily separable from benign task-related features so the model can learn the backdoor from a very small poisoned set.

Result: Achieves CA drop of less than 1% and demonstrates versatility across six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including first clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation; exhibits resilience against most existing defenses.

Conclusion: GCB presents a highly stealthy backdoor paradigm by optimizing triggers, prompting a need for stronger defenses and further study into clean-image backdoor risks.

Abstract: Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.

### [199] [Mapping Reduced Accessibility to WASH Facilities in Rohingya Refugee Camps with Sub-Meter Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07231)
*Kyeongjin Ahn,YongHun Suh,Sungwon Han,Jeasurk Yang,Hannes Taubenböck,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A remote-sensing framework detects shelters and quantifies WASH access in Rohingya camps, showing rising crowding (25→29.4 people per facility) and gender disparities; advocates equity-focused, data-driven allocation using high-resolution imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WASH access in dense, rapidly changing refugee camps is a critical public health concern and difficult to monitor with traditional surveys. A high-resolution, scalable method is needed to track accessibility and inform equitable resource distribution, especially for women and girls.

Method: Sub-meter satellite imagery with a semi-supervised segmentation framework to detect individual refugee shelters and identify WASH facilities (water pumps, latrines, bathing cubicles). Applied to multi-year data to compute accessibility metrics (people per facility) and conduct gender-disaggregated analyses.

Result: Shelter detection F1-score: 76.4%. WASH accessibility deteriorated from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender analysis shows reduced accessibility for women and girls when safety-related segregation is inadequate.

Conclusion: High-resolution remote sensing and ML enable detection of inequality and support demand-responsive, equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian settings; results underscore the need to prioritize underserved groups (e.g., women and girls) under budget constraints.

Abstract: Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services remains a major public health concern in refugee camps. This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian environments.

*Alexander Bauer,Klaus-Robert Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised structured corruption with identity-anchored regularization improves anomaly detection and segmentation in industrial inspection; achieves state-of-the-art on MVTec AD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies are rare and diverse; collecting representative defect samples is infeasible. A self-supervised repair task encourages robust representations and precise localization without labeled anomalies.

Method: Train an autoencoder to repair artificially corrupted training images. Use structured, spatially coherent perturbations that mimic defects (hybrid of segmentation and inpainting). Add Gaussian noise on top of occlusions as a Tikhonov regularizer to anchor the Jacobian of the reconstruction toward identity, stabilizing reconstructions for better detection and segmentation.

Result: State-of-the-art results on MVTec AD: I/P-AUROC of 99.9/99.4.

Conclusion: Identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction, improving anomaly detection and segmentation; supports the proposed self-supervised framework for automated industrial inspection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in automated industrial inspection, aiming to identify subtle or rare defects in otherwise uniform visual patterns. As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model leverages a vision-language encoder, a transformer decoder, and distance-based OOD prompts with semantic augmentation to detect unseen road objects, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring road safety and reliable decision-making in autonomous driving requires robust out-of-distribution (OOD) segmentation. Vision-language space offers rich semantic cues that can help recognize unseen or anomalous road objects in complex real-world contexts.

Method: The approach uses a vision-language encoder paired with a transformer decoder. It introduces Distance-Based OOD prompts at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes and applies OOD Semantic Augmentation to generate diverse OOD representations. Visual and textual modalities are aligned to generalize to unseen objects.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets show state-of-the-art performance for both pixel-level and object-level OOD segmentation, demonstrating robust generalization to unseen objects in diverse driving environments.

Conclusion: Vision-language-based OOD segmentation is a promising avenue to bolster safety and reliability in future autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In autonomous driving and robotics, ensuring road safety and reliable decision-making critically depends on out-of-distribution (OOD) segmentation. While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.
  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations. This result underscores the potential of vision-language-based OOD segmentation to bolster the safety and reliability of future autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 4D generative network (4DSTR) uses spatial-temporal rectification on Gaussian Splatting to improve spatial-temporal consistency and adapt to rapid motions in 4D content, with adaptive densification/pruning of Gaussian points; achieves state-of-the-art results in video-to-4D generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D generation methods struggle with spatial-temporal consistency and rapidly changing motion due to insufficient spatial-temporal modeling, limiting quality and realism of dynamic 4D content.

Method: Introduce 4DSTR, a network that modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. It enforces temporal correlation across generated sequences to rectify deformable scales and rotations, and employs an adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy that dynamically adds or deletes Gaussian points with awareness of their pre-frame movements.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D generation, achieving superior reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and robustness to rapid temporal movements.

Conclusion: 4DSTR effectively addresses spatial-temporal modeling gaps in 4D content generation, delivering strong performance in both reconstruction and temporal adaptation, and demonstrates promise for realistic 4D video synthesis and related tasks.

Abstract: Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a significant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D generation methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency and adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective spatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D generation, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamKV is a training-free framework that dynamically segments video streams, uses segment-level summaries for KV-cache retrieval, and applies guidance-based compression to improve streaming Video-LLMs in QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long, real-world videos challenge Video-LLMs due to inefficient KV-cache retrieval and limited compression; existing methods rely on uniform partitioning and do not jointly optimize retrieval and compression, motivating a unified, efficient solution.

Method: Introduce StreamKV: (1) dynamic semantic segmentation of video streams; (2) per-segment summary vectors for retrieval; (3) a guidance prompt to capture key semantic elements for KV-cache compression; (4) a unified, layer-adaptive module that performs retrieval and compression without training.

Result: On StreamingVQA benchmarks, StreamKV outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving higher accuracy while improving memory efficiency and reducing computational latency; code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: StreamKV offers a training-free, unified approach for semantic-aware KV-cache retrieval and compression in streaming Video-LLMs, enabling stronger QA performance with better efficiency.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the areas of video captioning, search, and summarization. However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency. The code has been released at https://github.com/sou1p0wer/StreamKV.

*R. P. Chowdhury,T. Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automatic ischemic stroke lesion segmentation across multiple MRI sequences using Res-Unet with transfer learning and axis-wise majority voting; achieves Dice of 80.5% on ISLES 2015 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual expert segmentation is time-consuming and inconsistent; hand-crafted features struggle to capture irregular, physiologically complex lesion shapes. A fast, automatic, and robust segmentation method across MRI sequences is needed.

Method: A Res-Unet-based framework trained on ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequences. The model is trained twice: first with pre-existing (pretrained) weights (transfer learning), then from scratch. Multispectral inputs include T1, T2, DWI, and FLAIR. 3D Dice and sensitivity are evaluated. Outputs from each axis are fused using a Majority Voting Classifier to produce a final segmentation.

Result: Dice score of 80.5% and accuracy of 74.03% on the ISLES 2015 dataset for 3D volumes, indicating effective automatic segmentation across MRI sequences.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective and fast automatic segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions across multiple MRI modalities. Transfer learning and axis-wise majority voting contribute to the reported performance, suggesting potential for clinical utility and needing further validation on diverse datasets.

Abstract: The accurate understanding of ischemic stroke lesions is critical for efficient therapy and prognosis of stroke patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method. Our efforts culminated in achieving a Dice score of 80.5\% and an accuracy of 74.03\%, showcasing the efficacy of our segmentation approach.

Conclusion: Glioma C6 is a valuable resource for developing robust and generalizable instance segmentation models in biomedical imaging, particularly for glioma cell analysis, and will facilitate cancer cell research by providing a realistic, annotated benchmark and training data.

Abstract: We present Glioma C6, a new open dataset for instance segmentation of glioma C6 cells, designed as both a benchmark and a training resource for deep learning models. The dataset comprises 75 high-resolution phase-contrast microscopy images with over 12,000 annotated cells, providing a realistic testbed for biomedical image analysis. It includes soma annotations and morphological cell categorization provided by biologists. Additional categorization of cells, based on morphology, aims to enhance the utilization of image data for cancer cell research.

Evaluates a progression of inference strategies from zero-shot to metadata integration and error feedback, showing increasing performance and interpretability. Open-source code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure consistent, robust image quality assessment for low-dose CT to support clinical decision making, addressing common degradations (noise, blur, contrast loss) and the variability of IQA metrics in clinical settings.

Method: Develop an LLM-based IQA system that generates numerical quality scores plus textual descriptions of degradations. Systematically evaluate inference strategies from zero-shot to metadata integration and error feedback, measuring how each step improves performance and interpretability. Codebase provided for reproducibility.

Result: The system yields high correlation between LLM-generated scores and reference quality metrics and produces interpretable textual outputs describing degradations. Each added inference strategy contributes to improved accuracy and interpretability, suggesting practical value for clinical workflows.

Conclusion: LLM-based IQA can deliver both quantitative scores and qualitative explanations, enhancing robustness and interpretability for LDCT assessment. Progressive inference strategies offer cumulative benefits, and the work provides open-source tooling to facilitate adoption in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) represents a significant improvement in patient safety through lower radiation doses, but increased noise, blur, and contrast loss can diminish diagnostic quality. Therefore, consistency and robustness in image quality assessment become essential for clinical applications. In this study, we propose an LLM-based quality assessment system that generates both numerical scores and textual descriptions of degradations such as noise, blur, and contrast loss. Furthermore, various inference strategies - from the zero-shot approach to metadata integration and error feedback - are systematically examined, demonstrating the progressive contribution of each method to overall performance. The resultant assessments yield not only highly correlated scores but also interpretable output, thereby adding value to clinical workflows.

### [208] [VADER: Towards Causal Video Anomaly Understanding with Relation-Aware Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07299)
*Ying Cheng,Yu-Ho Lin,Min-Hung Chen,Fu-En Yang,Shang-Hong Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADER combines per-frame anomaly scoring, context-aware sampling, and relational feature extraction with LLMs to produce causally grounded descriptions and QA for video anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video anomaly understanding methods emphasize detection/localization but overlook deeper causal interactions between objects, hindering interpretable explanations of anomalous behavior.

Method: Anomaly Scorer assigns per-frame anomaly scores; Context-Aware Sampling (CAES) captures causal context; a Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) model dynamic object interactions to produce compact relational representations; these cues are integrated with LLMs for detailed, causally grounded descriptions and anomaly-related QA.

Result: Demonstrated strong performance on real-world VAU benchmarks across tasks including anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning, advancing explainable video anomaly analysis.

Conclusion: VADER advances explainable video anomaly understanding by fusing visual relational cues with LLM-driven reasoning to deliver detailed, causally grounded explanations and robust anomaly-related QA.

Abstract: Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to provide detailed interpretation and semantic comprehension of anomalous events within videos, addressing limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on detecting and localizing anomalies. However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.

### [209] [Beyond Boundaries: Leveraging Vision Foundation Models for Source-Free Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07301)
*Huizai Yao,Sicheng Zhao,Pengteng Li,Yi Cui,Shuo Lu,Weiyu Guo,Yunfan Lu,Yijie Xu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) that uses Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as external knowledge sources to improve transferability and discriminability, via three modules: PGFA for global feature alignment, PIFA for instance-level contrastive alignment with VFM prototypes, and DEPF for entropy-aware fusion of pseudo-labels from detection VFMs and teacher models, achieving state-of-the-art SFOD across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFOD methods largely rely on internal source-model knowledge, which hampers cross-domain generalization and produces biased pseudo-labels, limiting transferability and discriminability. Vision Foundation Models offer broad generalization from massive, diverse data but are underutilized in SFOD. The paper seeks to leverage VFMs to enhance feature alignment and label quality in SFOD.

Method: 1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA): distills global features from VFMs with patch-similarity-based weighting to boost global feature transferability. 2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA): performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes. 3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF): fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models using an entropy-aware strategy to produce more reliable supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show state-of-the-art SFOD performance, demonstrating that incorporating VFMs yields notable gains in both transferability and discriminability.

Conclusion: Integrating Vision Foundation Models as external knowledge sources in SFOD can substantially improve cross-domain generalization and label quality. The proposed three-module framework (PGFA, PIFA, DEPF) effectively leverages VFMs to achieve superior SFOD performance.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.

### [210] [YoNoSplat: You Only Need One Model for Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07321)
*Botao Ye,Boqi Chen,Haofei Xu,Daniel Barath,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YoNoSplat is a fast, feedforward 3D Gaussians Splatting method that reconstructs scenes from an arbitrary number of images, handling both posed and unposed inputs and jointly predicting camera parameters and Gaussians with a mixing training strategy to decouple their learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from unstructured image collections is challenging due to the coupling between 3D geometry, camera poses, and intrinsics; existing methods struggle with uncalibrated data or slow inference. A fast, flexible, and robust approach is needed that can operate without strong pose/calibration assumptions.

Method: Predict local Gaussians and per-view camera poses; aggregate into a global Gaussian Splatting representation using either predicted or ground-truth poses. Introduce a mixing training strategy that starts with ground-truth poses and gradually incorporates predicted poses to reduce training instability and exposure bias. Resolve scale ambiguity with pairwise camera-distance normalization and embed camera intrinsics into the network. Also predict intrinsic parameters to handle uncalibrated inputs. Efficiency: reconstruct 100 views at 280x518 in 2.69s on GH200. 

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings, while offering rapid reconstruction and flexibility to operate with incomplete calibration data.

Conclusion: YoNoSplat provides a fast, versatile, and accurate solution for 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections. By decoupling 3D Gaussian learning from camera parameter estimation via a progressive mixing strategy and by embedding calibration information into the network, it delivers SOTA results with high efficiency and robustness to uncalibrated inputs.

Abstract: Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings. Our project page is at https://botaoye.github.io/yonosplat/.

Conclusion: The proposed IoT-CV framework is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste-dumping events at vulnerable urban locations and can inform targeted waste management interventions; further validation in diverse urban contexts would reinforce generalizability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a smart way to manage municipal solid waste by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision (CV) to monitor illegal waste dumping at garbage vulnerable points (GVPs) in urban areas. The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-adapted, CLIP-guided diffusion at inference time improves infrared image generation when training data is scarce, by fine-tuning a diffusion model on IR data and guiding sampling with an IR-adapted verifier; shows about 10% FID improvement on KAIST, suggesting a viable path for low-data IR domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared data annotation is scarce and specialized, hindering training of downstream models. Synthetic IR data could help, but training foundation-level diffusion models in IR is data-heavy. The work investigates an inference-time, domain-adaptive approach to improve IR generation quality with limited IR data.

Method: Fine-tune FLUX.1-dev on a small infrared image sample using parameter-efficient methods. Train a CLIP-based verifier adapted to infrared, and use this verifier during inference to guide diffusion sampling toward prompts that align with IR content. Evaluate on KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark (FID metric).

Result: Inferred improvements in generation quality, with a 10% reduction in FID on KAIST compared to unguided baselines.

Conclusion: Inference-time guidance via a domain-adapted verifier is a promising strategy to bridge the infrared domain gap in low-data settings and can accelerate synthetic IR data generation for infrared vision tasks.

Abstract: Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.

*Tianrui Feng,Zhi Li,Shuo Yang,Haocheng Xi,Muyang Li,Xiuyu Li,Lvmin Zhang,Keting Yang,Kelly Peng,Song Han,Maneesh Agrawala,Kurt Keutzer,Akio Kodaira,Chenfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free StreamDiffusionV2 enables interactive live streaming with video diffusion models, achieving near-linear multi-GPU FPS scaling, strict latency guarantees, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous GPUs; first frame in ~0.5s and 58.3–64.5 FPS on four H100 GPUs with 14B and 1.3B models respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live streaming requires ultra-low latency per frame and strict SLOs. Image-based diffusion struggles with temporal consistency; offline video diffusion emphasizes throughput and batching, not real-time guarantees. A training-free, scalable, SLO-aware system is needed to enable practical real-time generative streaming across diverse hardware.

Method: Propose StreamDiffusionV2: an SLO-aware batching scheduler and block scheduler, plus sink-token–guided rolling KV cache, motion-aware noise controller, and pipeline orchestration that parallelizes diffusion steps across network layers. Supports denoising steps in {1,2,3,4} and scales across heterogeneous GPUs without TensorRT or quantization.

Result: First frame rendered within 0.5s. Achieves 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, demonstrating near-linear FPS scaling and latency guarantees in a training-free setup.

Conclusion: StreamDiffusionV2 makes state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible for both individual creators and enterprise platforms by delivering ultra-low latency and scalable performance across heterogeneous GPUs without additional training or specialized runtimes.

Abstract: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing spatial MLLMs that depend on explicit 3D inputs or sparse supervision, by integrating structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning in a data-efficient framework.

Method: Introduce SpatialThinker with two components: (1) a data synthesis pipeline to create STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online reinforcement learning using a multi-objective dense spatial reward that enforces spatial grounding while enabling reasoning over a scene graph of task-relevant objects and relations.

Result: SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and sparse RL baselines on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o in this domain.

Conclusion: Coupling spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning enables robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advances multimodal LLMs toward human-level visual reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

Motivation: To enable diverse, controllable 3D motion generation from a single image by leveraging priors in video models and compact motion representations.

Conclusion: DIMO offers a scalable, efficient framework that fuses video priors with neural key point trajectories to enable diverse, controllable 3D motion generation from a single image.

Abstract: We present DIMO, a generative approach capable of generating diverse 3D motions for arbitrary objects from a single image. The core idea of our work is to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

### [216] [Scalable Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions Using Linear Bound Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06341)
*Nikolaus Vertovec,Frederik Baymler Mathiesen,Thom Badings,Luca Laurenti,Alessandro Abate*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable verification framework for neural control barrier functions (CBFs) that uses piecewise linear bounds from linear bound propagation (LBP) and McCormick relaxation to certify CBF conditions, enabling larger networks and broader activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifying that neural network CBFs actually satisfy safety conditions is computationally expensive, limiting network size and practical deployment for nonlinear control systems. A scalable verification method is needed that applies to control-affine dynamics and a wide class of activations.

Method: Extend linear bound propagation to compute bounds on network gradients; derive linear upper and lower bounds on CBF conditions via McCormick relaxation; apply to arbitrary control-affine systems and many activation functions; introduce a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively tightens bounds in chosen regions to reduce conservatism.

Result: The proposed approach scales to larger neural networks than existing state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, less-conservative verification method for neural CBFs, broadening their applicability in safety-critical nonlinear control systems and accommodating a wide range of network architectures and activation functions.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

### [217] [AGRAG: Advanced Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05549)
*Yubo Wang,Haoyang Li,Fei Teng,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGRAG proposes a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework that (1) uses statistics-based graph construction to avoid LLM hallucination in entity extraction, (2) models reasoning as a Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem solved by a greedy algorithm, producing explicit reasoning paths and allowing complex graph structures (e.g., cycles), aiming to improve reasoning and answering quality over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Three core challenges hinder Graph-based RAG: inaccurate graph construction due to LLM hallucinations, lack of explicit reasoning guiding retrieval, and inadequate answering quality that lags behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks.

Method: Construct the graph using statistics-based entity extraction instead of LLMs to avoid hallucination; formulate retrieval as MCMI subgraph generation to maximize influence with minimal edge cost, prove NP-hardness, and apply a greedy algorithm; use the resulting MCMI subgraph as explicit reasoning paths to steer LLMs toward query-related content and suppress noise; allow more complex graph structures including cycles beyond tree-based paths.

Result: The MCMI subgraph provides explicit reasoning paths that help the LLM focus on query-relevant content, reduce noise, and improve AGRAG's reasoning ability; the approach enables richer graph structures (e.g., cycles) compared to tree-based reasoning, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning.

Conclusion: AGRAG offers a novel graph-based RAG framework that addresses hallucination-prone graph construction, provides explicit reasoning via MCMI subgraphs, and supports richer reasoning structures (including cycles), leading to improved reasoning and answering performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

### [219] [Diversified Flow Matching with Translation Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05558)
*Sagar Shrestha,Xiao Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diversified Flow Matching (DFM) is an ODE-based method for Diversified Distribution Matching (DDM) that yields a unified translation function with transport trajectories, addressing GAN limitations and ensuring identifiability; it introduces bilevel optimization, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation, and is validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDM resolves content misalignment in unpaired domain translation and provides translation identifiability, but has been limited to GANs, which are unstable and do not provide transport trajectories. An ODE-based approach could supply translation trajectories and more stable training.

Method: Introduce DFM by adapting Flow Matching to DDM. To overcome FM's limitation of modeling velocity rather than the translation function, the authors propose a custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation to realize a tangible implementation and guarantee identifiability.

Result: Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the method’s effectiveness and supports translation identifiability.

Conclusion: DFM is the first ODE-based approach that guarantees translation identifiability for DDM, enabling tractable trajectory information and potentially more robust, stable training for unpaired domain translation tasks.

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

### [220] [Effective Test-Time Scaling of Discrete Diffusion through Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05562)
*Sanghyun Lee,Sunwoo Kim,Seungryong Kim,Jongho Park,Dongmin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IterRef introduces Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement for discrete diffusion models, using reward-guided noising-denoising transitions within a Multiple-Try Metropolis framework to iteratively refine each intermediate state, converging toward a reward-aligned distribution and delivering improved generation quality under low compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion methods struggle with test-time scaling; existing reward-guided approaches often assume current states are aligned and only influence the next transition, which limits gains when compute is constrained. There is a need for explicit, in-situ refinement of intermediate states to align with the reward distribution.

Method: Propose Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a test-time refinement framework that applies reward-guided noising-denoising transitions within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) sampler to iteratively refine each intermediate state in discrete diffusion. The method formalizes convergence to a reward-aligned distribution and emphasizes refining every state rather than only guiding the next transition, with evaluations on text and image domains.

Result: Across text and image tasks and diverse discrete diffusion models, IterRef yields consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality, with notable gains under low compute budgets that surpass prior state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: IterRef offers a principled, convergent approach to test-time refinement for discrete diffusion, enabling robust reward-aligned generation even under limited compute, and is broadly applicable across modalities.

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

### [221] [Lookahead Unmasking Elicits Accurate Decoding in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05563)
*Sanghyun Lee,Seungryong Kim,Jongho Park,Dongmin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LookUM reframes masked diffusion model sampling as path selection over unmasking orders, using a path generator and a verifier to choose a small number of candidate paths; yields strong gains on six benchmarks, including LLaDA variants, with only 2-3 paths; code release promised.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDM sampling relies on myopic heuristics (e.g., confidence-based sampling) that miss global consequences and fail to exploit test-time compute; early decoding mistakes cascade. A non-RL, lookahead framework at the path level is desired.

Method: Proposes LookUM: (i) a path generator that samples pools of unmasking sets to propose candidate paths; (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of proposed paths and uses importance sampling to select final paths; requires no external reward model and uses only 2-3 paths for peak performance.

Result: Consistent improvements across six benchmarks (math, planning, coding); LookUM performs notably on LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5; base LLaDA + LookUM rivals RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5; LookUM further improves LLaDA 1.5; code will be released.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-based verification provides orthogonal benefits to RL; LookUM demonstrates efficient, versatile path-level lookahead for masked diffusion models with broad applicability and strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: Multimodal polymer data with LoRA-tuned vision-language models improves polymer property prediction, surpassing unimodal baselines and reducing the need for multiple task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of foundation models for broad scientific tasks in materials/polymer science by leveraging multimodal data to enable generalizable property prediction and reduce deployment/maintenance costs.

Method: Construct a multimodal polymer dataset with instruction-tuning pairs, fine-tune vision-language models using LoRA, and evaluate on polymer property prediction against unimodal and baseline methods, assessing cross-property transfer.

Result: LoRA-tuned multimodal models outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, confirming the advantages of multimodal learning and potential cross-property transfer.

Conclusion: Multimodal instruction-tuning of vision-language models with Low-Rank Adaptation is effective for broad polymer property prediction tasks and can reduce the number of models needed, lowering deployment and maintenance costs in scientific domains.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPRIS introduces a concurrency-controlled partial rollout framework for RL post-training of LLMs, enabling a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early stopping, and trajectory reuse, together with cross-stage importance sampling to correct off-policy effects; it achieves up to 1.94x faster training on math reasoning benchmarks with comparable or better performance and released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address severe inefficiencies in fully synchronous RL for LLMs where long trajectories stall GPUs and waste resources; reduce idle time and improve throughput while preserving or improving learning quality.

Method: Maintain a fixed number of concurrent rollouts; early terminate once enough samples are collected; reuse unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts; Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction by concatenating log probabilities from previous policy with those re-computed under the current policy for IS weighting.

Result: Achieves up to 1.94x faster training on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks; performance comparable or superior to synchronous RL baselines.

Conclusion: CoPRIS demonstrates that concurrency-controlled partial rollouts with IS correction can speed up RL post-training for LLMs without sacrificing performance; code released.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

TL;DR: Spatio-Temporal Flow (FlowNet) presents a physics-inspired framework for dynamic systems by modeling flow transfers between nodes, using flow tokens and conservation-based transfers with adaptive masking and cascaded architecture; it achieves strong performance and interpretability on real-world systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based and attention-driven methods rely on similarity-based connectivity that neglects asymmetric flow exchanges which govern system evolution. A physics-inspired approach that enforces conservation and source-to-destination transfers can better capture spatio-temporal dynamics and provide interpretability.

Method: Introduce a Spatio-Temporal Flow paradigm. Develop FlowNet architecture using flow tokens as information carriers that simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution respects conservation laws. Include Adaptive Spatial Masking to suppress noise and adapt interaction radius; employ a cascaded architecture to improve scalability and nonlinear representation capacity.

Result: Empirical results show FlowNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven metrics across three real-world systems, demonstrating efficient performance and physical interpretability.

Conclusion: Provides a principled methodology for modeling complex spatio-temporal systems through explicit flow interactions, combining conservation principles with learnable flow-based communications.

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive framework enables efficient, calibrated state estimation for water distribution network DTs by focusing sensing on the most uncertain points, balancing accuracy and computational cost for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, community-driven foundation for cross-domain, reproducible benchmarking in scientific ML, scalable to future scientific motifs and computing patterns, with an open pathway to add new benchmarks and domains.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

Motivation: Hardware synthesis is becoming a bottleneck in rapid ML accelerator design; ML-based surrogates are needed to predict resource usage and latency to speed up design iterations. The work introduces a benchmark (wa-hls4ml) and a large synthetic dataset to evaluate predictors targeting Xilinx FPGAs.

Method: Construct wa-hls4ml benchmark with >680k fully connected and convolutional nets generated via hls4ml for Xilinx FPGA targets; evaluate resource and latency predictors against common ML model architectures; develop GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models to predict latency and resources; assess performance on synthetic test dataset.

Result: Surrogate models generally predict latency and resources for the 75th percentile within several percent of synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Conclusion: ML-based surrogates can accurately estimate accelerator resource usage and latency, supporting faster hardware design iterations; the benchmark and dataset provide a foundation for future improvements and broader applicability.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Motivation: Public-benchmark–driven TSFMs may not generalize to industry settings due to mismatches in dominant frequency components between pretraining data and downstream tasks; understanding this gap is essential for robust deployment.

Method: Empirical analysis on an industrial-scale mobile gaming task (player engagement prediction) comparing TSFMs to domain-adapted baselines; controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen vs unseen frequency bands to isolate the effect of spectral mismatch.

Result: TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines in the industrial task; spectral mismatch leads to systematic degradation of performance; frequency-awareness improves robustness.

Conclusion: Frequency awareness is critical for robust TSFM deployment; develop pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity and mismatch.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

### [229] [Unveiling the Training Dynamics of ReLU Networks through a Linear Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05628)
*Longqing Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that recasts multi-layer ReLU networks as input-dependent effective linear models (W_eff(x)), enabling sample-wise analysis of learning dynamics. Training causes same-class W_eff trajectories to converge while different-class trajectories diverge, offering a new view on decision boundaries and semantic representation formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the learning dynamics of deep ReLU networks by providing an interpretable, sample-specific linear narrative that links activation patterns to an effective mapping from input to output.

Method: For each input x, determine the activation pattern across layers to identify the active weights and compose them into an effective weight matrix W_eff(x) that maps the input to the output for that sample. Track W_eff(x) over training for many samples, and analyze convergence/divergence trends across same-class vs. different-class groups.

Result: As training progresses, W_eff(x) for samples from the same class converges, while those from different classes diverge. Tracking these trajectories yields insights into how class-specific decision boundaries and semantic representations emerge within the network.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-wise effective-weight framework offers a new, interpretable lens on representation learning in deep ReLU networks, linking activation patterns to emergent semantic structure and decision boundaries. It opens avenues for visualization and quantitative analysis of learning dynamics and could guide further theoretical development.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

### [230] [SSTODE: Ocean-Atmosphere Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05629)
*Zheng Jiang,Wei Wang,Gaowei Zhang,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSTODE: a physics-informed Neural ODE framework for SST prediction that recovers a latent velocity field via variational optimization and uses an Energy Exchanges Integrator to capture external forcing, yielding state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretable SST dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven SST models are accurate but black-box; existing physics-informed approaches struggle to represent key processes like coastal upwelling and external forcing (turbulent heat fluxes). A framework that combines advection-diffusion dynamics with interpretable external factors is needed to improve predictive performance and physical insight.

Method: Derive ODEs from fluid transport (advection-diffusion) to model SST dynamics; use variational optimization to recover a latent velocity field governing SST; introduce Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI) inspired by ocean heat budgets to incorporate external forcing; enable analysis of factor contributions and dynamics.

Result: SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performance on global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks; provides visualizable insights into the roles of advection, diffusion, and diurnal heating on SST evolution; demonstrates interpretability and physical consistency.

Conclusion: SSTODE offers a physically grounded, interpretable framework for SST forecasting that integrates internal transport dynamics with external forcing, enabling both accurate predictions and mechanistic understanding of upper-ocean thermal processes.

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

*Pasan Dissanayake,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabDistill distills pre-trained transformer knowledge into a compact neural network for tabular data, achieving strong few-shot performance with high parameter efficiency and outperforming classical baselines, and sometimes the teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the trade-off between the few-shot gains of transformer models and their high complexity by creating a parameter-efficient student that can perform well with limited data on tabular tasks.

Method: A distillation framework where a pre-trained transformer (teacher) guides a simpler neural network (student) to classify tabular data, likely using standard distillation losses (e.g., soft labels, possibly intermediate representations) to transfer knowledge.

Result: Student models surpass classical baselines (regular neural networks, XGBoost, logistic regression) under equal training data, and in some cases even outperform the original transformer teachers.

Conclusion: TabDistill provides a practical, parameter-efficient approach for leveraging transformer knowledge in tabular data with limited data, offering strong performance without the high model complexity.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

*Ruben Sharma,Ross D. King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MML-based unsupervised discovery of chemical substructures identifies both known and novel functional patterns that compress molecular data; dataset-specific groups yield fingerprints that outperform standard MACCS/MOrgan fingerprints in bioactivity regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether traditional chemical functional groups are useful explanations by testing a compression-based criterion and to improve predictive fingerprints via data-driven discovery of functional substructures.

Method: An unsupervised learning algorithm grounded in the Minimum Message Length principle searches for substructures that compress around around three million biologically relevant molecules. The approach is extended to 24 bioactivity datasets to identify dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints are constructed from the discovered groups and evaluated against MACCS and Morgan fingerprints using ridge regression for bioactivity prediction.

Result: The discovered substructures include most human-curated functional groups and novel larger patterns with more specific functions. Dataset-specific functional groups were found across the 24 datasets. Fingerprints built from dataset-specific groups significantly outperform MACCS and Morgan fingerprints in bioactivity regression tasks.

Conclusion: A compression-based, unsupervised discovery of functional groups yields meaningful, predictive substructures that align with curated knowledge and offer improved predictive fingerprints, with the added ability to tailor groups to specific datasets.

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

### [233] [Beyond Redundancy: Diverse and Specialized Multi-Expert Sparse Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05745)
*Zhen Xu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Kaidi Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a MoE-SAE framework with two innovations—Multiple Expert Activation and Feature Scaling—to improve expert specialization and feature diversity, achieving 24% lower reconstruction error and 99% reduction in feature redundancy versus existing MoE-SAE baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting large language models via sparse autoencoders (SAEs) is hindered by high-dimensional hidden layers needed for sparsity, leading to high training/inference costs. While MoE approaches reduce computation, experts often fail to specialize, resulting in overlapping features. The work aims to enforce specialization and diversity without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: Introduce Multiple Expert Activation to simultaneously engage semantically weighted subsets of experts to promote specialization, and Feature Scaling to adaptively scale high-frequency components to increase feature diversity. Evaluate on SAE/MoE-SAE setups against existing baselines, measuring reconstruction error and feature redundancy.

Result: Empirical results show a 24% reduction in reconstruction error and a 99% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MEA and Feature Scaling innovations bridge the interpretability-efficiency gap for LLM analysis, enabling transparent inspection with lower computational costs and more diverse, non-overlapping learned features.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SymLight uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to discover compact, interpretable symbolic priority functions for traffic signal control, enabling deployable policies with competitive performance on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL-based TSC policies are powerful but opaque and resource-hungry, limiting interpretability and edge deployment. A symbolic, interpretable, and deployable alternative is desirable.

Method: Proposes SymLight framework: a concise symbolic priority-function representation; MCTS-based search over priority functions; probabilistic structural rollout to reuse structure from high-quality discovered policies; evaluation on real-world traffic datasets against baselines.

Result: Gets superior performance across baselines while producing interpretable and deployable TSC policies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that interpretable, deployable TSC policies can achieve strong performance via symbolic priority-function search, suggesting practical deployment and potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

### [235] [Beyond the Lower Bound: Bridging Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification in Lexicographic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05802)
*Bo Xue,Yuanyu Wan,Zhichao Lu,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two elimination-based algorithms tackle lexicographic (hierarchical) multi-objective bandits by blending regret minimization with best-arm identification. One progressively eliminates suboptimal arms layer-by-layer; the other uses cross-objective information in each round to exploit dependencies, even beating single-objective lower bounds. Empirical results show superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge regret minimization and best-arm identification in multi-objective bandits with lexicographic preferences, and demonstrate that cross-objective information sharing can improve efficiency.

Method: 1) Layer-by-layer elimination aligned with objective priorities, yielding sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to single-objective algorithms. 2) A cross-objective algorithm that uses rewards from all objectives per round to share information across objectives, exploiting dependencies across objectives.

Result: The first algorithm achieves regret and sample complexity on par with best single-objective bandit algorithms. The second algorithm surpasses the known lower bound for single-objective bandits due to cross-objective information sharing. Empirical results validate improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Cross-objective information sharing enhances learning efficiency in lexicographic multi-objective bandits; the proposed elimination-based methods effectively combine regret minimization and best-arm identification, with practical performance gains.

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

### [236] [Measuring Model Performance in the Presence of an Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05805)
*Winston Chen,Michael W. Sjoding,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nuisance parameter weighting (NPW) provides an unbiased evaluation of ML models using data from randomized trials by reweighting the treatment group to mimic a no-intervention distribution, improving model selection versus naïve aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interventions in AI for social impact can bias model evaluation. RCTs are unbiased but waste data from the treatment group. Efficiently using all RCT data for model evaluation is essential.

Method: The paper first quantifies the estimation bias from naive aggregation of treatment and control, derives when this bias can mislead model selection, and then introduces NPW, an unbiased evaluation method that reweights treatment samples based on nuisance parameters to emulate the non-intervention distribution.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show NPW consistently achieves better model selection than the standard approach that ignores treatment data, across varying intervention effects and sample sizes.

Conclusion: NPW advances efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts by leveraging all RCT data to yield more reliable model comparisons and selections.

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

### [237] [MOSS: Efficient and Accurate FP8 LLM Training with Microscaling and Automatic Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05811)
*Yu Zhang,Hui-Ling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOSS provides efficient FP8 training by combining a two-level microscaling strategy for activations with automatic weight scaling in linear layers, achieving BF16-like stability and up to 34% throughput gain on a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8 offers memory and compute efficiency but suffers from instability and accuracy issues due to low precision. Existing mixed-precision approaches (per-group activations, per-tensor/block weights) incur dequantization overhead and rely on online scaling, which adds memory traffic and reduces FP8 benefits during training.

Method: Introduce two-level microscaling: a high-precision global scale paired with compact, power-of-two local scales for activations; automatic scaling for weights in linear layers that predicts and adjusts scales during training, removing the need for costly max-reduction operations.

Result: Demonstrates training of a 7B parameter model with FP8 that matches BF16 baseline accuracy while delivering up to 34% higher training throughput.

Conclusion: MOSS enables efficient, stable FP8 training for large models by reducing dequantization overhead and eliminating online scaling costs through hierarchical microscaling and predictive weight scaling.

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

TL;DR: A study on MoE offloading with caching and prefetching; analyzes expert activation and caching; introduces LFU caching; demonstrates speculative prefetching; discusses gating/experts for interpretability and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable deployment of Mixture of Experts (MoE) on memory-constrained devices by efficient offloading. Understand activation and caching patterns to inform pruning and robust inference.

Method: Trace-based analysis of expert activation and LRU caching; develop LFU caching optimization; implement speculative expert pre-fetching; provide detailed traces; examine behavior of gating network and experts.

Result: LFU caching improves efficiency over LRU; speculative pre-fetching shows substantial potential based on traces; rich insights into MoE gating and expert dynamics.

Conclusion: Offers a comprehensive characterization of MoE offloading, guiding pruning with minimal performance loss and aiding deployment on edge devices; provides data-driven insights for future interpretability and optimization studies.

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

### [239] [Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05859)
*Dazhao Du,Tao Han,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFRP introduces a Global Memory Bank and retrieval mechanism to inject global historical patterns into univariate forecasting, adaptively combining global predictions with local models to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard univariate forecasting models compress history into parameters and rely on local context, missing explicit access to global historical patterns. There is a need to leverage global knowledge to improve forecast accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to store global historical patterns. Use a retrieval mechanism to fetch similar patterns from the GMB during inference, generating global predictions. Adaptively combine these global predictions with outputs from any local prediction model to produce forecasts.

Result: Experiments on seven real-world datasets show that PFRP substantially improves the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by about 8.4%.

Conclusion: Explicitly leveraging global historical knowledge via memory retrieval enhances accuracy and interpretability of univariate forecasts, with code available for replication.

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMOD introduces a unified EEG emotion representation that aligns discrete and continuous emotion labels in a valence-arousal space, using a soft-weighted contrastive loss and a flexible backbone (Triple-Domain Encoder + Spatial-Temporal Transformer) to bridge semantic and structural gaps across heterogeneous EEG emotion datasets, achieving state-of-the-art generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field faces cross-dataset generalization gaps due to heterogeneous annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models are often dataset-specific and lack semantic alignment across emotion labels, hindering transferability.

Method: EMOD projects discrete and continuous emotions into a valence-arousal (V-A) space and uses a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss to cluster emotionally similar samples. It features a flexible backbone: a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer to capture temporal, spectral, and spatial features and handle variable EEG formats. Pretrained on eight public EEG datasets and evaluated on three benchmarks.

Result: EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition tasks on the evaluated benchmarks.

Conclusion: EMOD provides transferable, emotion-aware representations that bridge semantic gaps (emotion labels) and structural gaps (data formats) in EEG emotion recognition, enabling robust cross-dataset performance.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

TL;DR: First application of TabPFN to a combinatorial optimization problem (TSP) showing competitive solution quality with minimal training and rapid adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce training time/data requirements in combinatorial optimization by applying TabPFN to structured CO problems.

Method: Adapt TabPFN to TSP using a node-based approach and node-predicting strategy to build complete tours; fine-tune with minimal data; evaluate across varying instance sizes; aim for rapid adaptation (minutes).

Result: TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts from a single sample, generalizes across different TSP sizes, and achieves strong solution quality with little or no post-processing, comparable to models with post-processing.

Conclusion: TabPFN is a promising, resource-efficient approach for solving structured combinatorial optimization problems with rapid deployment.

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

TL;DR: First application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict hydrogen crossover in PEM electrolyzers, achieving real-time, high-accuracy predictions and robust extrapolation, enabling safe, scalable monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hydrogen crossover poses safety risks and reduces Faradaic efficiency; traditional physics-based models are computationally heavy and data-driven models lack extrapolation to dynamic operating conditions. Real-time monitoring is essential for gigawatt-scale PEM electrolysis.

Method: Develop a PINN that integrates mass conservation, Fick’s diffusion law, and Henry’s solubility law within a compact network (17,793 parameters). Validated on six membranes across industrially relevant conditions (0.05–5.0 A/cm², 1–200 bar, 25–85°C); achieves sub-millisecond inference suitable for real-time control and hardware-agnostic deployment (desktop to edge devices).

Result: Outstanding predictive performance (R² = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%). Maintains R² > 86% when predicting crossover at 2.5× pressures beyond training range, substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R² = 43.4%).

Conclusion: PINNs offer a physics-grounded, computationally efficient solution for real-time monitoring of hydrogen crossover in PEM electrolyzers, enabling safer, scalable deployment of green hydrogen infrastructure and potentially expediting net-zero targets.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), a two-stage anomaly troubleshooting framework for large-model distributed inference that uses GPU function trace data for nanosecond-resolution kernel-level anomaly detection and an LLM for causal reasoning and natural-language explanations; evaluated in Alibaba Cloud with high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly troubleshooting in large-model distributed inference is time-consuming and relies on domain experts, often yielding low accuracy. There is a need for automated, precise, and interpretable detection and diagnosis of anomalies.

Method: Two core innovations: (1) exploit synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers and leverage function trace data to detect kernel-level anomalies at nanosecond resolution; (2) integrate detection results into a domain-adapted large language model to provide systematic causal reasoning and natural-language interpretation of anomaly symptoms.

Result: In Alibaba Cloud production, KAT achieves precision >0.884 and recall 0.936 in anomaly detection, delivering detailed anomaly insights that narrow the diagnostic scope and improve troubleshooting efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: KAT demonstrates a practical, interpretable anomaly-troubleshooting framework for large-model distributed inference by combining trace-based kernel anomaly detection with LLM-driven reasoning, reducing manual effort and enhancing diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

Motivation: To overcome GPU under-utilization and performance bottlenecks caused by memory-bound KV caches in long-context LLM inference, by leveraging the heterogeneity between per-request unique data and massively reused shared sequences.

Method: Introduce the MoSKA architecture with Shared KV Attention; differentiate between unique per-request and shared data; batch concurrent requests to turn KV attention on shared data into a single compute-bound GEMM; adopt MoE-inspired sparse attention to prune search space; design a disaggregated hardware infrastructure specialized for unique vs shared data.

Result: Demonstrates up to 538.7x throughput gains over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, indicating a scalable architectural path for LLM inference.

Conclusion: MoSKA offers a comprehensive architectural solution that leverages shared data in LLMs to mitigate memory bottlenecks, delivering substantial throughput gains and a clear path toward scalable inference via specialized hardware and sparse attention strategies.

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

TL;DR: Introduce ITPP, a channel-independent MTPP model with an ODE-based backbone and type-aware inverted self-attention to decouple event-type information, achieving better predictive accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing that encodes all event types into a single fixed-size latent representation, entangling type-specific dynamics and increasing overfitting and degrading performance.

Method: Propose ITPP: an encoder-decoder MTPP framework with an ODE-based backbone and a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism that explicitly models inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types to achieve channel independence.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets show ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: Channel-independent decoupling of event-type information via ITPP enhances robustness and reduces overfitting, with strong empirical gains across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

TL;DR: Introduces Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear-time self-attention that preserves expressivity and supports parallel memory-saving implementation, backed by convergence theory and graph experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-attention is quadratic in sequence length, limiting practicality. Sparse attention methods exist but often lack theoretical guarantees about expressivity. There is a need for a theoretically grounded, scalable attention mechanism.

Method: Proposes Random Batch Attention, a linear self-attention mechanism. It processes tokens in random batches to achieve O(n) time complexity and enables parallelization on a new dimension. It is framed with theory from Random Batch Methods in numerical computation to explain convergence/expressivity.

Result: The approach theoretically preserves expressivity while achieving linear complexity and memory efficiency. It can improve many existing models by replacing their attention modules. Experiments on large graphs show the claimed advantages.

Conclusion: RBA provides a theoretical framework for self-attention and serves as a practical, scalable replacement for attention mechanisms in transformers, with broad applicability and a basis for future research.

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

TL;DR: SynthAgent introduces a fully synthetic supervision framework with dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories to improve synthetic data quality for web agent adaptation, and outperforms prior synthetic-data methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment-specific tasks and demonstrations. While synthetic data generation helps, it often introduces hallucinated tasks and noisy, misaligned trajectories. This motivates a higher-quality synthetic supervision approach.

Method: 1) Synthesize diverse tasks via categorized exploration of web elements to ensure broad coverage of the target environment. 2) Refine tasks during trajectory collection when conflicts with actual observations are detected to mitigate hallucinations while preserving task consistency. 3) Refine trajectories after collection using global context to reduce noise and misalignment. 4) Fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment.

Result: SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods in experiments, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic supervision is crucial for adapting web agents to new environments; dual refinement of tasks and trajectories yields better data and performance, with the code released publicly.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-cost proxies enable NAS for HAR by evaluating networks with a single forward/backward pass on a random batch, achieving within 5% of fully trained models across six datasets, with substantial computational savings and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Architecture Search is computationally expensive. For sensor-based HAR, efficient search is crucial. Zero-cost proxies (ZCPs) offer a cheap, correlate-with-performance metric that can be computed with a single pass, enabling rapid discovery of high-performing architectures.

Method: Apply ZCPs to HAR across six benchmark datasets. For each candidate architecture, compute the proxy from a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch. Use these proxies to select promising architectures, then train and evaluate them fully. Compare the best ZCP-selected architectures to a baseline obtained from 1500 randomly sampled architectures fully trained. Additionally, assess robustness to data noise.

Result: Architectures identified via ZCPs reach within 5% of the performance of fully trained models, while requiring far less computational effort than training 1500 architectures. The approach demonstrates substantial computational savings and robustness to data noise across the six HAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: Zero-cost proxies are effective for sensor-based HAR NAS, enabling near-parity with fully trained models at a fraction of the cost and showing resilience to noisy data. This supports adopting ZCPs for practical HAR deployment and suggests potential applicability to other sensor-based tasks.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.

*Ibna Kowsar,Kazi F. Akhter,Manar D. Samad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transferring attention from a fine-tuned LLM to a tabular-friendly gated transformer enables cross-domain tabular transfer learning (LATTLE) with low-resource data, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data suffer from feature-space heterogeneity across domains; LLM-based transfer learning is hindered by prompts and in-context learning for mixed data types. A low-resource, prompt-free transfer mechanism is needed.

Method: Fine-tune an LLM on source tabular data and transplant its selective key/value projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) for tabular data. The gFTT, with cross-domain attention, is then fine-tuned on target data, bypassing shared feature requirements, prompt engineering, and large pretrained models.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ten source-target pairs against 12 baselines shows LATTLE outperforms traditional ML, state-of-the-art deep tabular models, and transfer-learning models trained on vast tabular data.

Conclusion: Attention transfer from LLMs to a tabular-focused transformer provides an effective, low-resource transfer learning approach for learning relationships between data tables; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

TL;DR: Introduces SCRI (Supply Chain Resilience Inference) and the SC-RIHN hypergraph model to predict resilience from hypergraph topology and inventory trajectories without explicit dynamics, showing superior performance on synthetic benchmarks over MLPs, standard GNNs, and ResInf; suggests practical potential for early-warning risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions that propagate through networks; existing methods inadequately infer resilience without explicit dynamic equations and fail to capture higher-order, multi-entity interactions. There is a need for a method to infer resilience from observed data alone to guide proactive risk mitigation and robust design.

Method: Propose SCRI problem definition and SC-RIHN, a hypergraph-based network that uses set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to model multi-party firm-product interactions without explicit system dynamics.

Result: SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLPs, representative graph neural networks, and ResInf baselines on synthetic benchmarks, indicating strong predictive capability for resilience inference.

Conclusion: SC-RIHN holds promise for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems and could inform proactive mitigation and robust network design.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

*Sushant Mehta,Ishan Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified theory links in-context learning (ICL) in transformers to scaling laws, showing ICL performance follows power laws in depth L, width d, context length k, and data D, with task-structure-determined exponents. Under certain conditions, forward-pass gradient-based meta-learning emerges with an effective learning rate η_eff ~ 1/√(L d). The paper identifies sharp phase transitions at critical scales and an optimal depth-width allocation under parameter budget N = L d (L* ~ N^{2/3}, d* ~ N^{1/3}). Synthetic-task experiments validate the theory; the work offers necessary and sufficient conditions for ICL emergence and delineates computational limits for what transformers can learn in-context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a principled, scaling-based understanding of when and how in-context learning emerges in transformers, connecting empirical observations with a formal theory and identifying fundamental computational limits and optimal resource allocations.

Method: Develop a unified theoretical framework relating ICL to scaling laws; derive power-law dependencies on model size, context, and data; show conditions under which the forward pass implements gradient-based metalearning with a calculable effective learning rate; analyze phase transitions; optimize depth-width allocation given a fixed parameter budget; validate predictions on synthetic tasks with controlled experiments.

Result: Derives power-law relationships for ICL performance with exponents determined by task structure; demonstrates forward-pass gradient-based meta-learning with η_eff ~ 1/√(L d); identifies phase transitions at critical scales; provides optimal L*, d* under N = Ld; synthetic experiments corroborate the theory with exponents matching predictions.

Conclusion: Provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICL and maps fundamental computational limits of transformers' ability to learn in-context, including actionable guidelines for resource allocation across depth and width.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $η_{\text{eff}} = Θ(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSEs introduce a sparse mixture of sub-experts in transformer layers with a task-specific router to minimize forgetting and enable sublinear growth; it outperforms standard PEFT in continual learning on TRACE, with memory/computation savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning for LLMs with PEFT faces catastrophic forgetting when reusing a single parameter set and inefficiency when allocating new parameters per task. A method that isolates knowledge while enabling transfer is needed.

Method: Integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into transformer layers. A task-specific router selects and combines previously learned sparse parameters, enabling isolation and protection of knowledge in dedicated SubExperts. Capacity grows sublinearly due to sparse, shared usage.

Result: On TRACE benchmark datasets, MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in knowledge retention and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance with notable memory and computational savings.

Conclusion: MoSEs offer an adaptive, scalable PEFT framework for continual learning that minimizes forgetting and facilitates knowledge transfer across tasks, with sublinear growth in model size; promising direction for scalable LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

The framework actively explores varied, flexible problem specifications reflecting plausible operational realities. More importantly, the approach uses optimization-specific quantities (active constraint sets) that better capture the salient features of an ACOPF that lead to the optimal solution. Numerical results show superior generalization over existing sampling methods with an equivalent training budget, significantly advancing the state-of-practice for trustworthy ACOPF optimization proxies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MrCoM proposes a unified, multi-scenario model-based RL framework that generalizes across scenarios by factoring latent dynamics and using meta-regularization; it provides theoretical generalization bounds and reports empirical gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization across different scenarios remains a key challenge in model-based RL. While many MBRL methods build world models for single tasks, dynamics within a single simulation engine share invariants. A unified world model across scenarios could improve generalization and sample efficiency.

Method: 1) Decompose latent state into components based on dynamic characteristics to improve world-model prediction accuracy. 2) Introduce meta-state regularization to extract a unified representation of scenario-relevant information. 3) Introduce meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. 4) Provide theoretical analysis of the generalization error upper bound in multi-scenario settings. 5) Empirically evaluate generalization across diverse scenarios, comparing to prior SOTA methods.

Result: The approach yields significantly better generalization performance across diverse scenarios compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by systematic experiments.

Conclusion: A unified, factorized, regularized world model can generalize across multiple scenarios in model-based RL. Theoretical bounds underpin the generalization claims, and empirical results demonstrate practical gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

### [256] [Breaking the Modality Barrier: Generative Modeling for Accurate Molecule Retrieval from Mass Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06259)
*Yiwen Zhang,Keyan Ding,Yihang Wu,Xiang Zhuang,Yi Yang,Qiang Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLMR is a two-stage generative retrieval framework for MS/MS spectra that uses a contrastive pre-retrieval step to propose candidates and a generative stage to refine and re-rank via molecular similarity, achieving large gains (over 40% top-1) and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited spectral library coverage and cross-modal misalignment between mass spectra and molecular structures in retrieval tasks.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) pre-retrieval contrastive model selects top candidate molecules as contextual priors; (2) generative retrieval integrates these candidates with the input spectrum to generate refined structures, which are used to re-rank candidates by molecular similarity.

Result: GLMR outperforms existing methods, with over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy, and demonstrates strong generalizability on MassSpecGym and MassRET-20k datasets.

Conclusion: GLMR effectively mitigates cross-modal misalignment in MS/MS retrieval by combining contrastive pre-retrieval with generative refinement, offering improved accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

*Boyan Tang,Yilong Zeng,Xuanhao Ren,Peng Xiao,Yuhan Zhao,Raymond Lee,Jianghua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN), a Transformer-based model with a novel Lee Oscillator activation, Max-over-Time pooling, and lambda-gating, plus an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module for anomaly isolation. Demonstrates robustness to volatility and improved accuracy (up to 17% on Informer, up to 40% on GARCH) in electricity and financial markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial and electricity markets are highly nonlinear, rapidly fluctuating, and can be chaotic, especially under extreme conditions. Traditional activations (ReLU, GELU) can saturate and fail to capture dynamics, necessitating models that better handle volatility and abrupt pattern changes.

Method: Propose COTN architecture that combines: (1) Transformer backbone, (2) Lee Oscillator activation, (3) Max-over-Time pooling, and (4) lambda-gating mechanism. Includes an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns (e.g., spikes/crashes) to prevent corruption of predictions. Evaluate on electricity spot markets and financial markets, comparing against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: COTN demonstrates practical applicability and resilience, outperforming Informer by up to 17% and GARCH by as much as 40%, indicating improved forecasting under real-world market uncertainty and complexity.

Conclusion: COTN effectively navigates highly volatile systems and under duress, offering a robust forecasting tool for markets characterized by nonlinear dynamics and sudden regime shifts.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

*Wenjie Hu,Sidun Liu,Peng Qiao,Zhenglun Sun,Yong Dou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LinearNO: reinterpret Physics-Attention as canonical linear attention to remove slice/deslice reliance, achieving state-of-the-art PDE performance with fewer parameters and lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational burden of Transformer-based Neural Operators for PDEs by moving away from quadratic attention; uncover that slice-attention mechanics are not essential and that linear attention suffices.

Method: Two-step transformation that recasts Physics-Attention into canonical linear attention, producing Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO).

Result: State-of-the-art on six standard PDE benchmarks; parameter count reduced by ~40% and computational cost by ~36.2%; strong performance on industrial datasets AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Conclusion: LinearNO demonstrates that slice/deslice operations are not the key source of performance gains; a canonical linear-attention formulation yields superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and generalizes well to real-world industrial PDE problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Abstract: Since 2010, Kaggle has been a platform where data scientists from around the world come together to compete, collaborate, and push the boundaries of Data Science. Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

TL;DR: ReaDISH is a permutation-invariant reaction predictor that uses symmetric difference shingle encoding and geometry-structure interaction attention to model substructural interactions, achieving improved robustness under permutation perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML models for reaction prediction are sensitive to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and fail to capture substructural interactions governing reactivity, leading to unstable predictions and poor generalization.

Method: Introduce symmetric difference shingle encoding to capture reaction-specific structural changes while removing order dependence; implement geometry-structure interaction attention to model intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks show improved performance; robustness improves by about 8.76% on R^2 under permutation perturbations.

Conclusion: ReaDISH offers a robust, permutation-invariant, interaction-aware framework for reaction prediction with improved generalization, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applicability.

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

### [261] [Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363)
*Rathin Chandra Shit,Sharmila Subudhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework (FedFair-Traffic) that jointly optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy using Graph Neural Networks, DP mechanisms, and Gini-based fairness constraints. Demonstrates Pareto-efficient tradeoffs with real-world METR-LA data, achieving lower travel time, improved fairness, strong privacy, and reduced communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic optimization must balance efficiency, privacy, and equity. Centralized schemes invade user privacy and may worsen disparities; existing federated learning lacks explicit fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings.

Method: Propose FedFair-Traffic, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that combines Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy (via gradient clipping and noise injection) and Gini coefficient-based fairness constraints. Utilizes multi-objective optimization to converge to Pareto-efficient solutions while preserving data locality among vehicles.

Result: On METR-LA data, reduces average travel time by 7% (≈14.2 minutes) versus centralized baselines, improves traffic fairness by 73% (Gini = 0.78), achieves high privacy protection (privacy score = 0.8), and reduces communication overhead by 89%.

Conclusion: This work is the first to integrate efficiency, fairness, and differential privacy in a unified federated framework for urban traffic, showing scalability and potential for real-world deployment in metropolitan traffic control and federated transportation networks.

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents currently stop learning after deployment, hindering growth with experience. FLEX aims to enable lifelong, scalable improvement by leveraging accumulated experience without gradient-based updates.

Method: Construct a structured experience library through continual reflection on interactions with the environment. Use gradient-free updates to evolve capabilities via experience inheritance and scalability across agents, enabling progressive improvement across domains.

Result: Significant performance gains across domains: up to 23% on AIME25 (mathematical reasoning), 10% on USPTO50k (chemical retrosynthesis), and 14% on ProteinGym (protein fitness). Evidence of a scaling law for experiential growth and cross-agent experience inheritance.

Conclusion: FLEX demonstrates scalable, inheritable continuous agent evolution, representing a step toward lifelong learning for LLM-based agents and suggesting new directions for AI systems to grow from experience without gradients.

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

TL;DR: Interpretable AI for sepsis prediction that combines ML with clinical knowledge to improve accuracy while preserving explainability and clinical trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis requires rapid detection but ML models are often black-box; there is a need for models that are accurate and interpretable, aligning with medical expertise.

Method: An interpretable AI framework that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge, producing predictions that clinicians can understand, validate, and align with established expertise.

Result: The approach yields accurate predictions of sepsis onset and outputs that are interpretable and align with clinical reasoning, enhancing trust and potential adoption.

Conclusion: An interpretable AI approach for sepsis analysis that bridges ML power and clinical knowledge, potentially improving decision support and clinician trust.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid detection and treatment to prevent progression to severe sepsis, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Despite advances in medical technology, it remains a major challenge for clinicians. While recent machine learning models have shown promise in predicting sepsis onset, their black-box nature limits interpretability and clinical trust. In this study, we present an interpretable AI approach for sepsis analysis that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge. Our method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established medical expertise.

*Tiansheng Wen,Yifei Wang,Aosong Feng,Long Ma,Xinyang Liu,Yifan Wang,Lixuan Guo,Bo Chen,Stefanie Jegelka,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeqTopK redefines expert routing by selecting the top T*K experts across the entire token sequence, moving the budget from per-token to sequence-level. This enables end-to-end learned allocation, keeps total compute unchanged, requires minimal code, and improves performance—especially under high sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard TopK fixes the number of active experts per token, ignoring token difficulty. Prior adaptive routing methods add modules and hyperparameters and often require retraining from scratch. The goal is a simple, compatible, and scalable routing improvement that dynamically allocates compute according to token complexity without heavy overhead.

Method: Move the budget from token-level to sequence-level by selecting the top T*K experts across all T tokens in a sequence. This yields a global allocation that increases experts for hard tokens and reduces for easy ones, while preserving the overall budget. The approach is implemented with only a few lines of code and minor overhead, and remains compatible with pretrained MoE models.

Result: Empirical evaluations across math, coding, law, and writing show SeqTopK consistently outperforms standard TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods. Gains escalate with higher sparsity, reaching up to 16.9% in performance improvements.

Conclusion: SeqTopK is a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy well-suited for extreme sparsity regimes in next-generation LLMs. It maintains compatibility with existing MoE models while delivering notable gains with minimal code changes and overhead.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriShGAN enhances counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series by combining CounteRGAN with triplet loss and a Shapelet Extractor to improve robustness and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generate robust, realistic counterfactuals for multivariate time series that remain near the queried instance and align with the desired outcome distribution, addressing limitations of substitution-based methods and residual GANs that ignore decision boundary distance.

Method: An unsupervised learning framework (TriShGAN) within CounteRGAN augmented by triplet loss to enforce a distance metric learning objective. A Shapelet Extractor identifies discriminative subsequences to promote sparsity and training efficiency, enabling the model to focus on key features while generating counterfactuals.

Result: The approach aims to yield counterfactual explanations that balance minimal deviation from the queried time series with robustness to model perturbations and realism by capturing the feature distribution of the target outcome, achieving sparser and potentially more robust explanations.

Conclusion: TriShGAN offers a robust, efficient method for producing counterfactual explanations in multivariate time series by integrating triplet-distance learning and shapelet-based sparsity into the CounteRGAN framework, potentially improving applicability in real-world decision tasks.

Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

*João Mattos,Debolina Halder Lina,Arlei Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Critiques dyadic fairness in link prediction for hiding subgroup disparities and flawed ranking fairness; offers a more expressive evaluation framework and a lightweight post-processing method with decoupled predictors that improves fairness-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in link prediction is crucial because biased predictions can reinforce social inequalities; dyadic demographic parity is insufficient for ranking tasks and can obscure subgroup disparities.

Method: Formally analyzes limitations of current fairness evaluations, proposes an expressive framework for fairness assessment in ranking-based link prediction, and introduces a lightweight post-processing approach combined with decoupled link predictors to mitigate bias.

Result: The proposed framework enables more accurate fairness assessment; the post-processing method with decoupled predictors achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs by effectively reducing bias while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Dyadic demographic parity is inadequate for ranking-based link prediction. A more expressive evaluation framework and a simple post-processing method can better detect and mitigate biases, achieving strong fairness-utility performance.

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

*Asela Hevapathige,Asiri Wijesinghe,Ahad N. Zehmakan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive-depth GNN that assigns per-node aggregation depth using a theoretical framework, improving performance across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed-depth GNNs degrade on heterophilic graphs and models often specialize to a single regime; there is a need for a unified, flexible approach that accounts for local structure and label distribution.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework linking local structural and label features to information propagation at the node level; design a node-specific adaptive-depth GNN that selects aggregation depth per node using theory-grounded metrics; unifies performance across both homophily and heterophily.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements over standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks, indicating benefits of per-node adaptive depth and regime-agnostic design.

Conclusion: An adaptive-depth, unified GNN can handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs by tailoring propagation depth to local signals, offering a robust, generalizable advancement in GNN design.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

*Kaiyuan Zhai,Jiacheng Cui,Zhehao Zhang,Junyu Xue,Yang Deng,Kui Wu,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaberNet is a data-driven, causal, interpretable deep sequence model for cross-domain HVAC energy prediction that learns invariant representations to improve generalization across climatically diverse buildings; uses a global feature gate with self-supervised Bernoulli regularization and a domain-wise training scheme; achieves 22.9% NMSE improvement and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable cross-domain HVAC energy prediction given scarce labeled data and heterogeneous data across buildings and climates.

Method: CaberNet learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations; global feature gate trained with self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to select causal features; domain-wise training balances domain contributions, reduces cross-domain loss variance, and enforces latent factor independence; fully data-driven without prior knowledge.

Result: Evaluated on three buildings across three climatically diverse cities; outperforms baselines; NMSE reduced by 22.9% relative to best benchmark.

Conclusion: CaberNet provides robust cross-domain HVAC prediction through causal invariant representations, enabling scalable, label-efficient generalization; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/rickzky1001/CaberNet-CRL.

Result: Findings show that quantization improves ESS; large accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight tasks; even small models may incur substantial costs if implemented suboptimally; the approach provides rigorous empirical evaluation.

Conclusion: ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-aware model selection and offers extensive empirical data on inference-time environmental costs.

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

### [270] [Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06696)
*Dian Jin,Yancheng Yuan,Xiaoming Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMEA introduces magnitude-modulated, equivariant adapters that tune feature magnitudes per tensor order and per multiplicity, achieving state-of-the-art energy/force predictions with fewer trainable parameters while preserving equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) based on spherical harmonics are powerful for chemistry, but adapting pretrained models to new tasks or environments requires fine-tuning. Conventional PEFT methods (e.g., Adapters, LoRA) often break symmetry, making them incompatible with equivariant architectures; while existing equivariant PEFT like ELoRA improves efficiency, it retains many degrees of freedom that can perturb feature distributions and hurt performance.

Method: Introduce Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA): a lightweight, scalar gating mechanism applied per tensor order and per multiplicity to modulate feature magnitudes while preserving strict equivariance. This per-order/per-multiplicity modulation reduces trainable parameters and maintains symmetry.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks, MMEA consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels and does so with fewer trainable parameters than competing approaches.

Conclusion: Magnitude modulation suffices to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, signaling a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design and offering practical gains in parameter efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

*Jinyong Yun,Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Euijong Lee,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scare is an ultra-compressed transformer for on-device sensor calibration that achieves eight microscopic requirements by using Sequence Lens Projector, Efficient Bitwise Attention, and a hash optimization strategy, outperforming baselines on air-quality datasets and MCU deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation typically uses only three macro metrics (accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), which obscures bottlenecks like instantaneous error and worst-case latency. The work argues for eight microscopic requirements to ensure robust, real-time deployment on constrained devices.

Method: Three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins; (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) replaces computationally heavy multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes; (3) Hash optimization strategy enables stable training without auxiliary loss terms. The model is designed to be ultra-compressed and MCU-compatible.

Result: Empirically, Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments, and is claimed to be the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements.

Conclusion: Scare provides a practical, MCU-friendly transformer that balances accuracy, real-time performance, and efficiency across eight microscopic metrics, with potential generalizability to other on-device calibration tasks.

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

### [272] [Rank-1 LoRAs Encode Interpretable Reasoning Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06739)
*Jake Ward,Paul Riechers,Adam Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rank-1 LoRA adapters can reproduce most reasoning-benchmark gains with minimal parameter changes; activations are interpretable; a sparse autoencoder reveals meaningful features; supports using parameter-efficient training to study LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what drives improvements in reasoning models and whether small, interpretable parameter changes suffice, offering a lens into LLM reasoning dynamics.

Method: Apply a rank-1 LoRA to Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct; compare its performance to full fine-tuning on reasoning benchmarks; analyze LoRA activations for interpretability; train a sparse autoencoder on the LoRA activations to extract fine-grained and monosemantic features.

Result: The rank-1 LoRA recovers 73-90% of the full fine-tune performance on reasoning benchmarks; LoRA activations are as interpretable as MLP neurons and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors; the sparse autoencoder identifies fine-grained and monosemantic features.

Conclusion: Reasoning performance can largely arise from minimal parameter changes, and parameter-efficient training methods can serve as a targeted tool to uncover fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

### [273] [Implicit Federated In-context Learning For Task-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06757)
*Dongcheng Li,Junhan Chen,Aoxiang Zhou,Chunpei Li,Youquan Xian,Peng Liu,Xianxian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IFed-ICL is a novel implicit federated in-context learning framework that enables distributed inference via implicit representations of local context, reducing parameter updates and client computation while using model residual streams to boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of large language models relies on vast data, including private organizational data, but public data can deplete. Federated learning helps leverage private data with fewer trainable parameters; however processing high-dimensional features incurs substantial compute and communication cost. A more efficient, privacy-preserving, task-specific adaptation is needed.

Method: Convert client local context examples into implicit vector representations to enable distributed collaborative computation during inference. Inject model residual streams to enhance performance. Operates within a federated learning-inspired setup to minimize parameter updates and data transmission at the client, focusing on text classification tasks.

Result: IFed-ICL achieves outstanding performance on multiple text classification tasks, outperforming traditional fine-tuning by avoiding extensive parameter updates and reducing data transmission and local computation at the client. It enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly boosting task-specific model performance.

Conclusion: IFed-ICL provides a practical, privacy-preserving approach for leveraging private-domain data in distributed, task-specific contexts. By using implicit representations and residual streams, it reduces communication and computation while maintaining or improving performance, suggesting broader applicability to other NLP tasks and potential directions for future work in privacy, scalability, and robustness.

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

*Zhixiong Zhao,Haomin Li,Fangxin Liu,Yuncheng Lu,Zongwu Wang,Tao Yang,Li Jiang,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QUARK creates an FPGA-based, quantization-enabled accelerator that shares circuits for Transformer nonlinearities, delivering up to 1.96x end-to-end speedup over GPUs and >50% hardware overhead reduction, while preserving— and even boosting— accuracy at ultra-low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear operators in Transformer models are major contributors to inference latency and hardware resource usage. Efficiently accelerating all nonlinearities with shared hardware and quantization could yield substantial speedups and resource savings.

Method: Propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA framework that exploits common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable circuit sharing. It targets all nonlinear operators in Transformer-based models, delivering high-fidelity approximations and reusing hardware modules to reduce resource usage, aided by quantization-aware optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows up to 1.96x end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations; nonlinear hardware overhead reduced by over 50% versus prior approaches; accuracy preserved and even boosted under ultra-low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that circuit-sharing combined with quantization can efficiently accelerate Transformer nonlinearities on FPGA, yielding notable speedups and hardware savings without sacrificing accuracy, enabling practical deployment in CV/NLP workloads.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

### [275] [Data Trajectory Alignment for LLM Domain Adaptation: A Two-Phase Synthesis Framework for Telecommunications Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06776)
*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA) is a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes as supervision to adapt LLMs to low-resource verticals. Phase I generates diverse teachers’ outputs; Phase II rewrites and selects solution trajectories to align with the target student and perform signal-aware exemplar selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical deployment of LLMs (e.g., telecommunications) is limited by scarce, low-information-density data and edge constraints; improving supervision of solution processes can enable better domain adaptation without heavy computational modes.

Method: Phase I: initialize by synthesizing diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II: rewrite teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and style with student inductive biases; perform signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging.

Result: On TELEMATH for telecommunications mathematics (link budgets, SNR/AMC, power-control feasibility), DTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy: 72.45% pass@1, +17.65 points vs distilled-only training, +2.94 points vs strong baseline with thinking enabled. Token-shift analyses show gains in logical-structural discourse markers. Under edge-like inference, DTA cuts energy per output token by ~42% and end-to-end latency by ~60% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Aligning not just answers but the generation process yields compact, high-yield supervision that improves accuracy and efficiency for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

### [276] [On the Mechanisms of Collaborative Learning in VAE Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06781)
*Tung-Long Vuong,Julien Monteil,Hien Dang,Volodymyr Vaskovych,Trung Le,Vu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical and empirical framework for VAE-based collaborative filtering, showing that user collaboration is governed by latent proximity and latent Wasserstein distance; it analyzes local vs. global collaboration, compares two global-mixing approaches (β-KL regularization and input masking) with their trade-offs, and introduces an anchor regularizer to stabilize identities during masking and enable cross-user/item sharing; validated on Netflix, MovieLens-20M, Million Song, and deployed online on Amazon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF under masking, quantify when updates transfer across users, and enable stable, global information sharing without collapsing representations; and to provide practical, deployable mechanisms that improve recommendation quality.

Method: Derive a latent sharing radius and show how SGD updates transfer losses as a function of latent Wasserstein distance; analyze the geometry of VAE-based CF with clean inputs to compare local vs global collaboration; evaluate two global-mixing mechanisms—β-KL regularization and input masking—and introduce an anchor regularizer aligning user posteriors with item embeddings; conduct experiments on Netflix, MovieLens-20M, Million Song, and an online Amazon deployment.

Result: Finds that, with clean inputs, collaboration is mainly local (input-similar users). β-KL tightens the information bottleneck, increasing posterior overlap but risks representational collapse if too strong; input masking induces stochastic contractions/expansions that can bring distant users into the same latent neighborhood but may cause neighborhood drift. The anchor regularizer stabilizes users under masking and facilitates cross-item sharing. Empirical results on the three datasets show improved performance, and the online Amazon deployment confirms practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled view of how latent proximity governs collaboration in VAE-based CF, clarifies trade-offs between local and global mixing mechanisms, and offers a concrete regularizer to preserve user identity while enabling global consistency. It demonstrates practical gains on standard benchmarks and in a real-world deployment.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MASS enables resource-efficient sleep staging by masking partial EEG observations and using hierarchical prompt learning to maintain performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data collection requirements for sleep staging in resource-constrained settings (wearables, home monitoring) without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: A multi-level masking strategy to handle partial/irregular data and a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that forms a global prompt from unmasked data to guide patch- and epoch-level feature modeling within the Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS) framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art sleep staging performance on four datasets, with notable robustness when data is very limited.

Conclusion: MASS offers a practical, scalable solution for low-resource sleep monitoring by combining masking with prompt-based guidance to retain contextual information under partial observations.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

### [278] [Robust Causal Discovery under Imperfect Structural Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06790)
*Zidong Wang,Xi Lin,Chuchao He,Xiaoguang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust causal discovery framework that aligns imperfect priors with data through a credibility-guided penalty and a multi-task learning setup to resolve conflicts, effective for both linear and nonlinear SEMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imperfect or unknown priors degrade performance; existing methods often assume perfect priors or handle only specific error types, and rely on brittle thresholding that conflicts with data distribution.

Method: 1) Use a surrogate model to assess the credibility of structural constraints; 2) introduce a sparse penalization term that measures the loss between the learned adjacency and the constrained adjacency; 3) prove that the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective under ideal conditions; 4) when violations occur, adopt a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent to jointly minimize both objectives; 5) applicable to both linear and nonlinear settings.

Result: The approach demonstrates robustness and efficiency across diverse noise conditions and SEM types, with extensive experiments showing effectiveness under imperfect structural constraints.

Conclusion: The paper presents a principled knowledge-data harmonization strategy: assess constraint credibility, enforce a compatibility penalty, prove alignment under ideal conditions, and resolve conflicts via multi-task learning, yielding robust causal discovery for linear and nonlinear SEMs.

Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

*Kunhao Li,Wenhao Li,Di Wu,Lei Yang,Jun Bai,Ju Jia,Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MIP-Editor, a multimodal influential neuron path editor for targeted forgetting in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that uses modality-specific attributions to edit influential neuron paths, enabling coordinated, cross-modal unlearning while preserving general knowledge; shows strong forgetting with good retention and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs raise privacy, toxicity, and IP concerns due to broad knowledge; existing neuron-editing MU methods struggle with cross-modal consistency and degrade generalization when sensitive neurons are pruned. A multimodal, pathway-aware approach is needed to forget targeted knowledge without harming overall capability.

Method: Introduce Multimodal Influential Neuron Path Editor (MIP-Editor). Compute modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths encoding forget-set knowledge, then perform influential-path-aware neuron editing via representation misdirection. The method coordinates forgetting across text and vision components while preserving general reasoning paths.

Result: Empirical results show strong unlearning: up to 87.75% forgetting rate and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. For textual tasks: up to 80.65% forgetting with 77.9% retention of general performance. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: MIP-Editor offers superior multimodal unlearning by targeting influential neuron paths with modality-aware attributions, enabling coordinated forgetting across modalities with minimal degradation to general capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

### [280] [Recursive Dynamics in Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Networks: Toward Reflective Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06798)
*B. G. Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FH-RL is a fast-weight, homeostatic, reentrant neuron mechanism enabling internal recurrence in transformer-like nets. By sweeping reentry gain γ, the study introduces metrics IRR, ESRI, and RDP, and finds a stable reflective band around γ≈0.10–0.20 where internal feedback is highly expressive yet spectrally stable, suggesting thought-like recursive processing emerges from a balance of amplification and regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge fast-weight associative memory with recursive cognition theories by enabling internal recurrence in primarily feedforward networks. Quantify emergent internal dynamics and relate them to cortical reentry concepts.

Method: Propose FH-RL architecture combining fast weights, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback. Conduct controlled experiments sweeping reentry gain γ. Define three metrics: Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Analyze reentry quantity, learned feedback matrix Wr, and spectral/dynamic properties across γ.

Result: Reentry quantity grows with γ; the learned feedback matrix Wr remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. A stable reflective band emerges near γ≈0.10–0.20 where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI stays near zero, and RDP shows low-frequency cycles. This indicates reflective, thought-like internal processing arises from balancing feedback amplification with homeostatic regulation.

Conclusion: The work links fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition by showing that a principled balance between amplification and homeostatic control yields expressive, stable internal processing within transformer-like models.

Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

*Bin Wang,Boxiang Tao,Haifeng Jing,Hongbo Dou,Zijian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CtrlFlow is a trajectory-level synthetic data approach for model-based RL that uses conditional flow matching to generate trajectories from initial states to high-return terminals without modeling environment dynamics, and optimizes sampling via control energy tied to the non-linear Controllability Gramian, leading to robust and generalizable policies with improved sample efficiency on MuJoCo benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses instability and error accumulation in long-horizon model-based rollouts by avoiding explicit dynamics modeling and instead directly modeling trajectory distributions. Aims to produce diverse, high-quality trajectory data to enhance policy learning and cross-task generalization.

Method: Proposes CtrlFlow, which uses conditional flow matching (CFM) to synthesize trajectory distributions from initial states to high-return terminal states without learning the environment transition function. It enforces optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing control energy computed from the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, promoting diverse and efficient trajectories for training.

Result: In online experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks, CtrlFlow achieves better performance than dynamics-model-based approaches and demonstrates superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods, with improved robustness and cross-task generalization due to the diverse trajectory data.

Conclusion: Trajectory-level synthetic data via CFM and controllability-energy minimization can stabilize and improve policy learning in MBRL, offering a promising direction to mitigate model error accumulation and to enable cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency. However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

*Hector R. Rodriguez,Jiechen Huang,Wenjian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A ML-guided Monte Carlo solver for capacitance extraction (DeepRWCap) predicts transition quantities to guide each walk step, achieving high accuracy and substantial speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern densely packed semiconductor geometries create challenges for unbiased sampling in random-walk steps across multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. There is a need to accelerate capacitance extraction while preserving accuracy beyond existing stochastic methods.

Method: A two-stage neural architecture that decomposes outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D CNNs to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions for localized kernel behavior. Grid-based positional encodings and cube-symmetry-informed design reduce redundancy. Trains on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations to predict Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, and the signs/magnitudes of weights guiding each walk step.

Result: Mean relative error of 1.24% ± 0.53% on self-capacitance benchmarking against the Raphael solver across 10 industrial designs spanning node scales from 12 to 55 nm. Approximately 23% speedup over Microwalk, with about 49% acceleration on designs where runtimes exceed 10 seconds.

Conclusion: ML-guided random-walk solvers can deliver accurate capacitance extraction with substantial speedups, demonstrating generalization across complex, high-contrast dielectric configurations and potential for integration into design flows; symmetry- and encoding-aware architecture design enhances generalization and reduces learning redundancy.

Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh-free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

### [283] [TuckA: Hierarchical Compact Tensor Experts for Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06859)
*Qifeng Lei,Zhiyong Yang,Qianqian Xu,Cong Hua,Peisong Wen,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TuckA introduces Tucker-based, multi-expert adaptation for PEFT to better capture diverse task data while remaining parameter-efficient. It creates a compact 3D tensor of experts via Tucker decomposition, organizes experts hierarchically, uses batch-level routing to reduce router parameters, and employs data-aware initialization for balanced load. Empirical results across NLP, vision, and reasoning tasks show strong performance with efficient parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PEFT methods rely on a single low-rank adaptation matrix per layer, which struggles to model the diversity of samples in complex tasks. There is a need for multiple, efficiently parameterized experts that can be routed to by data-driven mechanisms without exploding parameter counts.

Method: Apply Tucker decomposition to form a compact 3D tensor where each slice is an expert. Use a hierarchical grouping of experts across granularities to capture local and global patterns. Employ batch-level routing to decide which experts to use, reducing router parameter size by a factor L (number of adapted layers). Initialize experts with data-aware schemes to balance load without loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TuckA, showing improved efficiency and competitive or superior performance compared to traditional PEFT approaches across tasks and modalities.

Conclusion: TuckA provides a scalable, data-aware, multi-expert PEFT framework that efficiently captures diverse data patterns via Tucker-based compact expert tensors, hierarchical routing, and balanced initialization, yielding strong cross-domain performance with limited parameter growth.

Abstract: Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.

### [284] [DeepBooTS: Dual-Stream Residual Boosting for Drift-Resilient Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06893)
*Daojun Liang,Jing Chen,Xiao Wang,Yinglong Wang,Suo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepBooTS: a dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method for non-stationary time-series forecasting that uses block-wise ensembles with auxiliary highway branches to progressively reconstruct the intrinsic signal. Grounded by a bias-variance analysis showing weighted ensembles reduce variance without increasing bias, it reports large gains (≈15.8% avg) and sets a new benchmark across large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data often exhibit pronounced non-stationarity and concept drift, undermining forecast robustness. Existing methods rely on instance normalization and struggle to adapt without increasing bias or variance. The paper aims to quantify drift through a bias-variance lens and design a learning framework that enhances robustness and interpretability.

Method: First, a bias-variance analysis shows that weighted ensembles can reduce variance without increasing bias in the presence of drift. Based on this, the authors propose DeepBooTS, an end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method. Each deep-model block acts as an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. Block outputs correct the residuals of prior blocks, enabling a learning-driven decomposition of inputs and targets to improve drift robustness and interpretability.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale time-series datasets shows the method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin, with an average improvement of 15.8% across datasets, suggesting a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

Conclusion: DeepBooTS enhances versatility, interpretability, and robustness to concept drift in TS forecasting while delivering substantial performance gains, positioning it as a strong candidate for state-of-the-art forecasting on non-stationary data.

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) exhibits pronounced non-stationarity. Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

### [285] [COGNOS: Universal Enhancement for Time Series Anomaly Detection via Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06894)
*Wenlong Shang,Peng Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COGNOS improves reconstruction-based TSAD by regularizing residuals to Gaussian white noise during training and post-processing anomaly scores with a Kalman smoother, yielding large gains across models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction-based TSAD often relies on MSE, producing noisy residuals with poor signal-to-noise ratio. Aligning residuals with Gaussian white noise and denoising scores should improve anomaly detection reliability.

Method: 1) Gaussian-White Noise Regularization during training to constrain output residuals to Gaussian white noise; 2) Kalman Smoothing post-processor to denoise raw anomaly scores; 3) model-agnostic framework evaluated across 12 backbone models and multiple real-world benchmarks.

Result: Average F-score uplift of 57.9% across 12 backbone models on several real-world datasets, demonstrating robust separation of true anomaly signals from fluctuations.

Conclusion: Directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for improving anomaly detection, with COGNOS providing a universal enhancement to existing reconstruction-based TSAD systems.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems.

### [286] [On The Presence of Double-Descent in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06895)
*Viktor Veselý,Aleksandar Todorov,Matthia Sabatelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double descent exists in model-free DRL: larger actor-critic networks can generalize better past the interpolation point, with policy entropy dropping as capacity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the double-descent phenomenon to DRL in non-stationary settings and identify a mechanism.

Method: Systematically vary model capacity in Actor-Critic DRL; use Policy Entropy as an information-theoretic metric to track policy uncertainty during training; analyze the relation between capacity, entropy decay, and performance.

Result: Preliminary evidence of an epoch-wise double-descent curve in DRL; the second descent coincides with a sustained reduction in Policy Entropy, suggesting over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer.

Conclusion: DD is a factor in DRL; entropy decay provides an information-based mechanism for designing agents with better generalization, transferability, and robustness.

Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

*Boyan Tang,Xuanhao Ren,Peng Xiao,Shunbo Lei,Xiaorong Sun,Jianghua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel hybrid deep learning framework for day-ahead electricity price forecasting that combines Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) and Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM) to handle extreme conditions and anomalies; achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency on CA and Shandong datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme conditions and market anomalies degrade forecast accuracy; there is a need for models that capture both long- and short-term patterns while detecting/removing anomalous patterns to maintain forecast quality and grid reliability.

Method: A hybrid architecture: Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) uses self-attention to weigh critical historical segments, capturing long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM) uses unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain, heat waves, festivals). The two components are integrated for day-ahead price forecasting and evaluated on datasets from California and Shandong Province.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency across the two regional datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DAT+ASM hybrid framework shows promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems; further validation across more markets and analysis of robustness and deployment considerations would strengthen the claim.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.

*Keita Kinjo*

TL;DR: A framework for generating and evaluating counterfactual explanations for time-series forecasts that leverage exogenous variables, with analysis of variable influence and selective modification, supported by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability of machine learning in time-series forecasting is important, especially for decisions driven by forecasts. Counterfactual explanations (CE) offer intuitive, actionable insights, and this work targets CE for time-series forecasting using exogenous variables.

Method: Propose a method to extract counterfactual explanations for time-series forecasts with exogenous variables; analyze the influence of each variable over the entire time horizon; generate CEs by altering only specific variables; evaluate CE quality using appropriate metrics; provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments indicate the approach yields accurate, practical CEs that are actionable and interpretable, demonstrating the method's viability for real-world decision-making in time-series contexts.

Conclusion: The work contributes to interpretability in time-series forecasting by enabling targeted, variable-specific counterfactuals using exogenous inputs, with demonstrated theoretical and empirical support for its usefulness.

Abstract: Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.

### [289] [Sampling and Loss Weights in Multi-Domain Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06913)
*Mahdi Salmani,Pratik Worah,Meisam Razaviyayn,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-domain weighting (sampling and loss) for multi-domain data in large-scale training can complement each other to reduce SGD gradient variance and narrow the generalization gap; theory in linear regression supported by experiments; joint dynamics study guides combining weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When training with data from heterogeneous domains, deciding how much each domain contributes is crucial; this work investigates how sampling and loss weighting interact and their effects on variance and generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis via linear regression to characterize how sampling and loss weights affect gradient variance and generalization; empirical experiments validate findings; analysis of the joint dynamics and potential combination strategies.

Result: Sampling and loss weights are complementary: they reduce gradient variance and improve generalization; joint dynamics show how to combine them to capture contributions from each domain; both theory and experiments support claims.

Conclusion: A principled framework for data mixing across domains; using both types of weights can improve training efficiency and generalization; guidance on jointly optimizing sampling and loss weighting.

Abstract: In the training of large deep neural networks, there is a need for vast amounts of training data. To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.

### [290] [Learning to Focus: Prioritizing Informative Histories with Structured Attention Mechanisms in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06946)
*Daniel De Dios Allegue,Jinke He,Frans A. Oliehoek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structured temporal priors in a Transformer-based world model improve data efficiency in partial-observable RL, with Gaussian Attention delivering major gains; per-head memory-length priors are less beneficial and can hurt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In partially observable reinforcement learning, trajectories are sparse and reward-driven. Standard self-attention distributes weight across all past tokens, making it hard to focus on the few transitions critical for control. Structured priors aim to bias attention toward informative history.

Method: Introduce per-head memory-length priors to constrain attention windows and distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs, integrated into UniZero's Transformer-based dynamics head for planning under partial observability; evaluated on Atari 100k.

Result: Gaussian prior dominates efficiency gains, enabling smoother attention to informative transitions; memory-length priors often truncate useful signals. Gaussian Attention achieves ~77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero.

Conclusion: Encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention helps prioritize informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability. Discrete memory windows can be hard to learn reliably; smooth distributional priors adapt across horizons for robust data efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.

*Erel Naor,Ofir Lindenbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid autoencoder for tabular data combining a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree encoder, both with sample-specific gating, to create complementary views and improve low-label SSL performance; inference uses only the neural encoder; spectral analysis shows distinct biases and the method outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data challenge: deep nets struggle due to sensitivity to irrelevant features and a bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions, making it hard to capture high-frequency, localized structure with limited labels. SSL lacks effective augmentations for tabular data.

Method: Train two encoders (neural and OSDT) with their own stochastic gating networks for sample-specific feature selection, sharing a decoder and cross-reconstruction loss. The two encoders provide complementary input views reflecting their inductive biases; during training the OSDT encoder guides the neural encoder toward tabular-friendly representations. Inference uses only the neural encoder.

Result: Spectral analysis reveals the distinct inductive biases of the two encoders. The method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture with model-based augmentation and cross-reconstruction provides robust improvements for SSL on tabular data, with the OSDT encoder guiding the neural encoder during training while keeping inference flexible by using only the neural path; spectral evidence supports the complementary biases of the encoders.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

*Bowei He,Bowen Gao,Yankai Chen,Yanyan Lan,Chen Ma,Philip S. Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S^2Drug is a two-stage contrastive framework that integrates protein sequence and 3D structure for virtual screening, using sequence pretraining on ChemBL with ESM2 and a residual gating-based fusion plus an auxiliary binding-site prediction task to improve protein-ligand matching and binding-site localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DS-based VS methods rely mostly on structural data and ignore protein sequences, which are abundant and can generalize better; integrating sequences is challenging due to redundancy and noise in large datasets. The paper aims to bridge sequence and structure to improve generalization and binding-site localization.

Method: Stage 1: Protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL with an ESM2 backbone plus a sampling strategy to reduce redundancy/noise on protein and ligand sides. Stage 2: Fine-tuning on PDBBind, fusing sequence and structure via a residue-level gating module and adding an auxiliary binding site prediction task to localize binding residues and model 3D spatial arrangement, within a contrastive learning framework for protein-ligand representations.

Result: S^2Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance across benchmarks and achieves strong results in binding site prediction, demonstrating the benefit of jointly leveraging protein sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating sequence information alongside 3D structure in contrastive representation learning enhances virtual screening accuracy and binding-site localization, highlighting the value of bridging sequence and structure for protein–ligand modeling.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization-aware training enables 2–3 bit weight/activation policies for continuous-control RL on an Artix-7 FPGA, achieving microsecond latency and microjoule-per-action energy while maintaining FP32-level performance and improving input-noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable deployment of continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware with tight latency and power budgets by avoiding costly floating-point pipelines through low-bit quantization.

Method: Quantization-aware training of RL policies for integer inference, plus a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Evaluated across five MuJoCo tasks by varying input precision and quantization bits per weight/activation; measures latency and energy on target hardware and compares to a quantized reference.

Result: Found policies with as few as 2–3 bits per weight and per internal activation. These policies are competitive with FP32 baselines. On the Artix-7 FPGA they achieve microsecond-level inference latency and microjoules per action, outperforming the quantized reference. Quantized policies also show increased input-noise robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization-aware training enables efficient, robust continuous-control policies suitable for FPGA deployment, achieving strong performance with very low bit-widths and favorable hardware metrics, suggesting practical viability for energy- and latency-constrained robotics.

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

*Matteo Pettenó,Alessandro Ilic Mezza,Alberto Bernardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores balancing KLD and Attribute-Regularization in variational information bottleneck for symbolic music with explicit continuous attribute control; shows that attribute transformations can reconcile controllability with latent regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit latent variable models enable controllable data synthesis via structured latent spaces. Balancing reconstruction/KLD loss with an auxiliary AR loss is delicate; misbalance reduces controllability or violates prior assumptions. The work targets symbolic music generation with continuous, controllable attributes.

Method: The study analyzes the trade-off between KLD and AR in variational information bottleneck models for music generation. It argues that joint minimization is hard in existing approaches and investigates how suitable attribute transformations of the latent factors can achieve both controllability and regularization. The approach focuses on explicit latent representations and continuous attribute control.

Result: Findings indicate that conventional methods struggle to minimize KLD and AR simultaneously, whereas applying appropriate attribute transformations enables both controllability of continuous musical attributes and proper regularization of the latent space.

Conclusion: Attribute transformations offer a viable solution to reconcile controllability and latent regularization in VIB-based symbolic music generation, suggesting a promising direction for jointly optimizing regularization losses without sacrificing prior structure.

Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.

### [295] [Conditional Diffusion as Latent Constraints for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07156)
*Matteo Pettenó,Alessandro Ilic Mezza,Alberto Bernardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A plug-and-play diffusion-constraint framework uses a library of small conditional diffusion priors on latents of a frozen unconditional symbolic music model to enable precise control over attributes (note density, pitch range, contour, rhythm) with improved attribute-target correlations and preserved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide expert-level, fader-like control over musical attributes in symbolic generation beyond plain conditioning on language or musical context.

Method: Freeze an unconditional symbolic music generator; apply a library of small conditional diffusion models as implicit priors on the latents (plug-and-play constraints); evaluate across attributes like note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity; compare against traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraint methods.

Result: Diffusion-driven latent constraints yield stronger correlations between target attributes and generated outputs than traditional methods, while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of diffusion-based latent constraints for controllable symbolic music generation across diverse attributes, offering a flexible framework for expert-level control.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

### [296] [Fuzzy Label: From Concept to Its Application in Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07165)
*Chenxi Luoa,Zhuangzhuang Zhaoa,Zhaohong Denga,Te Zhangb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes fuzzy labeling to capture uncertainty in labels and enhances label learning performance by integrating fuzzy labels into KNN-based methods for both single-label and multi-label tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label annotations often contain noise, ambiguity, and subjectivity, making binary labels lossily informative. Fuzzy labels promise a richer representation of uncertainty, potentially improving learning from labeled data.

Method: Introduce an efficient fuzzy labeling method to mine and generate fuzzy labels from data. Integrate fuzzy labels into classical KNN and multi-label KNN algorithms, creating fuzzy-label-enhanced variants for both single-label and multi-label learning.

Result: Experimental results show that fuzzy labels more accurately characterize real-world labeling information and significantly improve the performance of label-learning models compared to their non-fuzzy counterparts.

Conclusion: Fuzzy labeling enriches the label space and yields notable performance gains in both single-label and multi-label learning scenarios, validating the utility of fuzzy labels in practical label learning tasks.

Abstract: Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., "yes/no") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends the SMiLE enforcement framework for neural networks to handle global relational properties (over the entire input space), achieving full guarantees, scalability, and broad generality; competitive with baselines in accuracy/runtime and superior in guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a strong need to enforce robustness, fairness, and other domain-specific properties in neural networks with full, global guarantees, but existing methods mainly address local properties and provide limited guarantees.

Method: Extend SMiLE to support global relational properties, ensuring scalability across model complexity and compatibility with general properties and backbones; provide full satisfaction guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness across synthetic and real data for regression and classification tasks shows competitive accuracy and runtime versus property-specific baselines, with superior generality and guaranteed satisfaction.

Conclusion: SMiLE shows promise as a general platform for enforcing global relational properties in neural networks, enabling broader research and applications with full guarantees.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.

*Sayambhu Sen,Shalabh Bhatnagar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An off-policy adversarial imitation learning method improves sample efficiency over GAIL by using off-policy learning, double Q stabilization, and reward-free value learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAIL-like imitation learning is sample-inefficient due to on-policy methods (e.g., TRPO); IL from expert demonstrations avoids reward engineering but suffers from sample inefficiency; the motivation is to improve data efficiency and stability in imitation learning.

Method: An off-policy adversarial imitation learning framework that combines off-policy learning with stabilization via double Q-network architecture and value learning without inferring the reward function.

Result: Shows reduced sample requirements to robustly match expert behavior, i.e., improved sample efficiency in imitation learning.

Conclusion: Off-policy adversarial imitation learning with double Q stabilization and reward-free value learning can achieve better sample efficiency for imitation tasks, addressing instability and reward engineering concerns.

Abstract: Learning complex policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by instability and slow convergence, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty of reward engineering. Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-efficient self-play RL framework with imperfect-information search achieves superhuman Stratego play, surpassing top humans at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the notion that Stratego’s hidden-information and strategic complexity requires massive budgets; demonstrate that strong AI performance can be attained cost-effectively.

Method: Develops general self-play reinforcement learning approaches and a test-time search procedure that operates under imperfect information, enabling strategic planning and decision-making in Stratego.

Result: The approach attains vastly superhuman performance, matching or exceeding top human levels at a few thousand dollars of budget, rather than requiring industrial-scale resources.

Conclusion: Self-play RL combined with imperfect-information search is a viable, cost-efficient path to high-performance AI in complex, hidden-information games like Stratego.

Abstract: Few classical games have been regarded as such significant benchmarks of artificial intelligence as to have justified training costs in the millions of dollars. Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GroundCUA builds a large desktop grounding dataset with expert annotations and introduces GroundNext models that achieve state-of-the-art results with far less data; RL and OSWorld-agentic evaluations show strong performance, highlighting the importance of high-quality desktop-grounding data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Desktop UI grounding data is scarce compared to web/mobile. A large, expert-annotated dataset is needed to train reliable agents that can connect natural language instructions to screen elements across diverse desktop tasks.

Method: GroundCUA collects 56K screenshots from 87 applications across 12 categories with 3.56M human-verified on-screen-element annotations. From expert demonstrations, diverse instructions are generated. GroundNext models (3B and 7B) are trained via supervised fine-tuning on this data, followed by reinforcement learning post-training. Evaluations span five benchmarks, plus OSWorld with o3 planner for agentic settings.

Result: GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks with supervised fine-tuning using less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. RL post-training further improves results. In the OSWorld agentic setting using the o3 planner, GroundNext matches or surpasses models trained with substantially larger datasets.

Conclusion: High-quality, expert-driven desktop grounding datasets are crucial for advancing general-purpose computer-use agents and enable data-efficient training of competitive models.

Abstract: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

### [301] [TNT: Improving Chunkwise Training for Test-Time Memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07343)
*Zeman Li,Ali Behrouz,Yuan Deng,Peilin Zhong,Praneeth Kacham,Mahdi Karami,Meisam Razaviyayn,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TNT introduces a two-stage training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance for RNNs with deep test-time memorization (Titans/TTT). It enables massive context parallelization and yields substantial training speed-ups while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallelization for RNNs relies on chunksize, creating a speed-accuracy trade-off that hinders scalable training of memory-rich models; a method to separate training efficiency from inference performance is desirable.

Method: Stage 1: efficiency-focused pre-training with a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details; periodically resetting local memory breaks sequential dependencies to enable massive parallelization. Stage 2: brief fine-tuning in which only the local memory modules adapt to smaller, high-resolution chunks to maximize accuracy with minimal overhead.

Result: TNT achieves up to 17x training speed-up compared to the most accurate baseline configuration on Titans and TTT, while also improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach removes a critical scalability barrier for expressive RNNs with deep memory, establishing a practical foundation for continued development and progress toward closing the performance gap with Transformers.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.

### [302] [Adaptive Sample-Level Framework Motivated by Distributionally Robust Optimization with Variance-Based Radius Assignment for Enhanced Neural Network Generalization Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05568)
*Aheer Sravon,Devdyuti Mazumder,Md. Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variance-driven, adaptive sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) assigns per-sample robustness budgets based on online loss variance, solved via a water-filling inner maximization under KL-style bounds; it improves robustness under distribution shifts with a warmup, ramp schedule, and label smoothing, without requiring group labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations undermine ERM. A single global robustness budget can be overly conservative or misallocated; per-sample adaptivity can better allocate robustness where needed.

Method: Var-DRO framework with two-sided KL-divergence bounds on the ratio of adversarial to empirical weights for each sample, leading to a linear inner maximization solved by a water-filling algorithm. Includes a warmup phase, linear ramp on the global budget, and label smoothing. Unsupervised (no group labels).

Result: On CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), Var-DRO achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared with ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance and matches or surpasses KL-DRO. On CIFAR-10 (original), Var-DRO remains competitive, with expected modest trade-offs for robustness.

Conclusion: The framework is unsupervised, easy to implement, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient, delivering improved robustness to distribution shifts while preserving performance on clean data.

Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stepwise self-evaluation improves failure detection in multi-step LLM tasks; stepwise scoring outperforms holistic by up to 15% relative AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable failure detection for high-stakes, multi-step reasoning with LLMs. Prior confidence estimation largely targets single-step outputs, leaving multi-step processes under-addressed.

Method: Compare holistic versus step-by-step confidence scoring on two multi-step benchmark datasets. Evaluate error-detection performance using AUC-ROC, analyzing whether stepwise scoring better captures per-step errors.

Result: Stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to a 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Self-evaluating LLMs yield meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning.

Conclusion: Stepwise self-evaluation provides a practical framework to detect failures and improve the trustworthiness of LLMs in complex, multi-step tasks.

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

*Dake Bu,Wei Huang,Andi Han,Atsushi Nitanda,Bo Xue,Qingfu Zhang,Hau-San Wong,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training strategies (e.g., RLVR, ORM/PRM) shape foundation-model reasoning by reweighting a tree-structured chain of thought; exploration preserves rare, high-uncertainty traces needed for hard problems, even as overall entropy contracts and common patterns dominate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the paradox that exploration helps performance yet does not expand the base reasoning scope; reconcile with a Markov-chain view of easy vs hard reasoning steps and post-training reweighting.

Method: Formalize post-training dynamics with Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC) where pretraining expands the reasoning tree and post-training reweights chain-of-thought; classify steps into easy/hard as low/high-probability transitions; analyze effects via theory and empirical simulations.

Result: RLVR induces a squeezing effect: lower reasoning entropy and loss of some correct paths; ORM/PRM rewards promote consistency over accuracy, favoring common patterns; rare high-uncertainty traces by the base model are crucial for solving hard instances; exploration strategies (rejecting easy cases, KL regularization) help preserve these rare traces; simulations corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Exploration remains essential for hard problems because it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces that post-training methods tend to squeeze out; targeted exploration strategies can mitigate this and align post-training dynamics with hard-task requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models exhibit broad knowledge but limited task-specific reasoning, motivating post-training strategies such as RLVR and inference scaling with outcome or process reward models (ORM/PRM). While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.
  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.
  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A real-time, floorplan-aware HAR framework that converts raw ambient sensor streams into trajectory-like image sequences, processed by a hybrid spatial-temporal model with learnable time embeddings and attention, achieving superior performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field struggles with real-time inference, spatial grounding, and temporally-aware modeling. Prior work relies on pre-segmented data and ignores the environment’s physical layout, reducing robustness in continuous, real-world deployments.

Method: 1) Project sensor activations onto the building floorplan to create trajectory-aware, image-like sequences representing movement flow. 2) Use a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. 3) Introduce a learnable time embedding module encoding cues like hour-of-day and day-of-week. 4) Apply an attention-based encoder to selectively focus on informative segments within each observation window, enabling robust recognition across activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. 5) Operate on raw, unsegmented sensor streams for real-time inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets show the method outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating practicality for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

Conclusion: The proposed MARAuder’s Map provides a practical, robust solution for real-time HAR by incorporating floorplan-based spatial representations, temporal embeddings, and attention to handle continuous ambient-sensor data and cross-activity transitions.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

*Yunshan Zhong,Yanwei Qi,Yuxin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IEC is a test-time iterative refinement method that converts exponential error growth in efficient diffusion models into linear growth, improving image quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient diffusion methods introduce approximation errors to save compute; these errors accumulate across diffusion steps and are hard to fix after deployment, necessitating a post-hoc correction approach.

Method: Introduce Iterative Error Correction (IEC); analyze how errors propagate across timesteps; provide a theoretical proof that IEC reduces error growth from exponential to linear; implement as a plug-in during inference without retraining or architectural changes; enables a controllable trade-off between quality and efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluations show IEC consistently improves generation quality across diverse datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures.

Conclusion: IEC offers a practical, generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models without requiring retraining or changes to architecture.

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper gives a theoretical and empirical analysis showing that transformer length generalization on state-tracking tasks is governed by attention concentration and problem structure; it introduces recursive self-training to extend reasoning length, and proves constant-depth transformers can learn NC1-complete problems with chain-of-thought, backed by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI reasoning patterns learned with chain-of-thought can extrapolate to longer, harder tasks, by linking transformer attention dynamics to the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems and providing optimization guarantees.

Method: Theoretical analysis of gradient-descent trained transformers on synthetic state-tracking tasks; characterizes length generalization via attention concentration; introduces a recursive self-training scheme to extend solvable lengths; provides optimization guarantees that constant-depth transformers can learn NC1-complete problems with CoT; supportive experiments.

Result: Shows that the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs extrapolation; attention concentration mediates length generalization; recursive self-training extends the feasible reasoning length; proves optimization guarantees for NC1-complete learnability with CoT; experiments corroborate theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Offers a theoretical framework connecting attention mechanisms to length generalization in reasoning tasks, demonstrates a practical method (recursive self-training) to extend CoT length, and places NC1-complete learnability of state-tracking tasks within reach of constant-depth transformers, all supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

TL;DR: CAMP-HiVe is a dynamic Hessian-based neural pruning method that merges weight pairs to approximate curvature and preserve critical weights, achieving strong compression with minimal accuracy loss and outperforming existing pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enable efficient deployment of deep learning models on resource- and energy-constrained systems by reducing model size and compute without sacrificing performance, leveraging curvature information (Hessian) to more accurately identify important weights than simple magnitude-based pruning.

Method: CAMP-HiVe (cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian approximation) uses Hessian-vector products to capture curvature information and a power iteration to identify essential directions; it iteratively merges weight pairs (significant with less significant) to prune while maintaining performance; the framework is adaptive and adjusts weight significance in real time.

Result: Empirical results indicate substantial reductions in computational requirements while preserving high accuracy across architectures such as ResNet-18, ResNet-56, and MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, outperforming state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Conclusion: A dynamic, curvature-informed pruning approach can effectively reduce compute and model size with minimal accuracy loss, making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

*Himanshu Pal,Venkata Sai Pranav Bachina,Ankit Gangwal,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoReTTA is a low-resource, two-stage adversarial attack on continuous-time dynamic graphs that degrades TGNN performance by about 29.47% across four datasets and four SOTA models. It sparsifies the graph by removing high-impact edges using 16 temporal importance metrics, then substitutes removed edges with degree-preserving adversarial negatives. It is plug-and-play, largely undetectable by anomaly detectors, and robust to several defenses, achieving up to 42% degradation on MOOC and outperforming 11 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and characterize security vulnerabilities of temporal graph neural networks in high-stakes applications, by proposing a practical, low-resource poisoning framework that remains stealthy and effective across datasets, models, and defenses.

Method: Two-stage attack: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of 16 tested temporal importance metrics; (2) replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via a novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. The attack is plug-and-play, does not require surrogate models, and adheres to realistic unnoticeability constraints.

Result: The framework degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 benchmark datasets and 4 SotA models. Per-dataset degradation includes up to 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and remains robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods.

Conclusion: LoReTTA demonstrates that effective, stealthy, low-resource poisoning of continuous-time dynamic graphs is feasible, highlighting the need for stronger defenses and robust TGNN architectures that consider both sparsification vulnerabilities and degree-preserving adversarial sampling.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and is robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods, establishing its effectiveness, unnoticeability, and robustness.

*Ananad Krishnakumar,Vengadesh Ravikumaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid cell-level embedding approach combines semantic, type, and spatial cues with Chamfer/Hausdorff aggregation to measure spreadsheet similarity, achieving perfect template reconstruction on FUSTE and outperforming Mondrian in unsupervised clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods fail to capture spatial layouts and type patterns defining templates; scalable template discovery is needed for retrieval-augmented generation, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Method: Convert spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings that integrate semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positions; aggregate distances across spreadsheets using Chamfer and Hausdorff distances; perform unsupervised clustering to discover template families; compare against the graph-based Mondrian baseline on the FUSTE dataset.

Result: Demonstrates superior unsupervised clustering performance; achieves perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index ARI = 1.00) on FUSTE, outperforming Mondrian (ARI = 0.90); enables large-scale template discovery for downstream tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid embedding-and-distance approach effectively captures semantics, types, and layouts for template discovery, offering strong performance and practical applications in large spreadsheet collections.

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying structurally similar spreadsheets fail to capture the spatial layouts and type patterns defining templates. To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Result: Fractal-based architectures demonstrate strong performance and computational efficiency on CIFAR-10 within five epochs, supporting the claim that fractal design is a feasible and resource-efficient method for automated architecture exploration.

Conclusion: Fractal design offers a feasible, resource-efficient approach for automated architecture exploration and scalable architecture search, enabling a broad generation of diverse models with balanced depth and width.

Abstract: It introduces FractalNet, a fractal-inspired computational architectures for advanced large language model analysis that mainly challenges model diversity on a large scale in an efficient manner. The new set-up involves a template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally efficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and resource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration.

### [312] [Evidence-Bound Autonomous Research (EviBound): A Governance Framework for Eliminating False Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05524)
*Ruiying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EviBound introduces dual governance gates (pre- and post-execution) to enforce evidence-backed claims in LLM-driven research tasks, eliminating hallucinations with ~8.3% overhead; nine evidence-bounded metrics are validated, with 0% hallucination on tested tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based autonomous research agents frequently report false claims or incomplete artifacts. There is a need for architectural governance that requires machine-checkable evidence to ensure research integrity and avoid unverified or false outputs.

Method: Implement two complementary gates: (1) Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs to catch structural violations; (2) Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries with recursive path checking and optional metrics validation. Claims propagate only when a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status exist. Execution includes bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1–2 attempts). Evaluation on 8 benchmark tasks across infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests."

Result: Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) had 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduced hallucinations to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound achieved 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task blocked at approval gate, with about 8.3% execution overhead.

Conclusion: Integrity in research agents can be achieved via governance gates rather than relying on model scale; architectural properties provide robust defense against false claims by enforcing machine-checkable evidence.

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

### [313] [SMAGDi: Socratic Multi Agent Interaction Graph Distillation for Efficient High Accuracy Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05528)
*Aayush Aluru,Myra Malik,Samarth Patankar,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Distills a 40B five-agent Llama MAS into a 6B student (SMAGDi) using an explicit debate-graph and Socratic decomposition approach, preserving 88% of accuracy on StrategyQA and MMLU, outperforming prior distillation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAS achieve higher reasoning but are computationally expensive; need compact models that inherit multi-agent reasoning benefits.

Method: Represent debate traces as directed interaction graphs with nodes as intermediate steps labeled by correctness; edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence; train a 6B student with a composite objective (language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, embedding alignment) to preserve fluency and structured reasoning.

Result: On StrategyQA and MMLU, the 6B student retains 88% of the 40B MAS accuracy; outperforms MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enable small models to inherit multi-agent debate benefits while remaining deployment-efficient.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) often achieve higher reasoning accuracy than single
models, but their reliance on repeated debates across agents makes them
computationally expensive. We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that
transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact
Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed
interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with
correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The
student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling,
graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to
preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi
compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of
its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as
MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines. These results highlight that
explicitly modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enable small
models to inherit the accuracy benefits of multi-agent debate while remaining
efficient enough for real-world deployment.

*Francisco Caravaca,Ángel Cuevas,Rubén Cuevas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large-scale measurement study quantifying LLM inference energy across 21 GPU configurations and 155 architectures (32.5k measurements) using vLLM; yields a predictive model for unseen combos; implemented as a browser extension to raise awareness of environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs scale, inference energy becomes a dominant and growing cost. Systematic analyses of inference energy are limited, hindering understanding and mitigation of environmental impact.

Method: A measurement-based study with over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures (from small open-source models to frontier systems) using the vLLM inference engine. Energy use is quantified at the prompt level. The authors analyze how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand and develop a predictive model that generalizes to unseen architectures/hardware, implemented as a browser extension.

Result: Identified how architectural and operational factors influence energy demand; created a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy for unseen architectures and hardware; deployed as a browser extension to raise awareness of generative AI environmental impact.

Conclusion: Inference energy for LLMs is measurable and predictable across diverse setups. The work provides a data-driven basis for energy-aware model deployment and design, and offers tooling to increase public awareness of environmental costs.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

### [315] [Anchors in the Machine: Behavioral and Attributional Evidence of Anchoring Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05766)
*Felipe Valencia-Clavijo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anchoring bias in LLMs is robust and interpretable, detectable via log-probability shifts and exact Shapley-value attribution across six models; scaling modulates sensitivity and prompt design affects attribution, highlighting both risks and a reproducible framework for bias evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether anchoring in LLMs arises from surface imitation or genuine probability shifts, and to quantify internal mechanisms with a reproducible framework bridging behavioral science, safety, and interpretability.

Method: 1) Conduct log-probability-based behavioral analysis with controls for training-data contamination. 2) Compute exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify the anchor's influence on model log-probabilities. 3) Develop a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score that integrates behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models.

Result: Anchors shift entire model output distributions even when controlling for data contamination; exact Shapley attribution indicates anchors reweight log-probabilities. Six open-source models (Gemma-2B, Phi-2, Llama-2-7B show robust anchoring; GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, GPT-Neo-125M show variability). Attribution effects vary with prompt design, signaling fragility in treating LLMs as faithful human substitutes.

Conclusion: Anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, with a reproducible framework for evaluating other cognitive biases. The work highlights safety and interpretability considerations and provides a bridge between behavioral science and LLM evaluation, though caution is warranted due to sensitivity to prompt design and model scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

*Bowen Xu,Xinyue Zeng,Jiazhen Hu,Tuo Wang,Adithya Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagnoLLM is a hybrid clinical-AI pipeline combining Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving 88% accuracy with human-trusted reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve trustworthy clinical AI by combining accurate predictions with transparent, biologically grounded explanations; equip clinicians and patients with audience-tailored interpretations.

Method: GP-unmix: a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty; integrate regulatory priors from eQTL analysis; train a neural classifier on these features; deploy an LLM-based reasoning module to translate outputs into diagnostic reports grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge; use post-hoc explanations rather than end-to-end predictions.

Result: The neural classifier attains 88.0% accuracy in Alzheimer's Disease detection; human evaluations show the generated diagnostic reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for physicians and patients.

Conclusion: LLMs, when used as post-hoc reasoners in a hybrid diagnostic pipeline, can effectively communicate model outputs and support trust without compromising predictive performance.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate
predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We
present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian
deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation
for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian
Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression
profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological
uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL
analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance
in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human
understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that
translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in
clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations
confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored
for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as
post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective
communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

### [317] [An Empirical Study of Reasoning Steps in Thinking Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05874)
*Haoran Xue,Gias Uddin,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study of thinking LLMs for code generation evaluates six models across 100 tasks to understand the quality and structure of reasoning traces, showing that step counts and verbosity affect performance, with completeness as the main failure mode and complexity driving reasoning quality; models show some stability and ability to self-correct, offering nuanced insights for software engineering applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the quality and usefulness of explicit intermediate reasoning traces generated by thinking LLMs in code generation, addressing questions of structure, efficiency, correctness, and completeness beyond mere final outputs.

Method: Six state-of-the-art thinking LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Qwen-QwQ) were tested on 100 code-generation tasks from BigCodeBench of varying difficulty. The study quantified reasoning-chain structure via step counts and verbosity, performed controlled step-budget adjustments, and conducted a 21-participant human evaluation across efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. A reasoning-problematic taxonomy was developed, and a stability analysis examined consistency of logical structures across computational effort with evidence of self-correction.

Result: Increasing step counts can improve resolution for some models/tasks; modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks but less so on hard tasks. Completeness is the dominant failure mode; hard problems are more prone to incompleteness. Reasoning quality correlates with task complexity. Thinking LLMs show stable logical structures across effort levels and can self-correct earlier errors, yielding actionable insights for software engineering AI tools.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering, highlighting completeness as a key bottleneck, the impact of task difficulty on reasoning quality, and the potential for step-budget tuning and self-correction to influence outcomes.

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.

*Hehai Lin,Hui Liu,Shilei Cao,Jing Li,Haoliang Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a three-level, sample-level bias quantification framework for multimodal misinformation benchmarks, combining coarse (modality benefit), medium (information flow), and fine (causal) analyses; validated with human evaluation on two benchmarks; finds ensemble views improve reliability, detector-induced fluctuations exist, and views agree on modality-balanced but diverge on biased samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal misinformation benchmarks show modality bias at the dataset level and rely on manual spurious correlations, lacking scalable, sample-level insights for automated analysis across vast online information.

Method: Introduce three bias quantification methods corresponding to coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained analyses of modality bias; ensemble multiple views for reliability; validate with human evaluation on two popular benchmarks.

Result: Key findings: (1) Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; (2) Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; (3) Different views agree on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Conclusion: The study outlines a path for robust, sample-level bias analysis in multimodal misinformation detection, highlighting the value of ensembling diverse views, awareness of detector fluctuations, and view-dependent behavior across biased vs balanced samples.

Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE enables self-abstraction from grounded experience for LLM-based software engineering agents, allowing iterative self-improvement. It induces concise plan abstractions from initial rollouts and uses them as guidance for subsequent runs, yielding consistent gains across backbones and agent architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents operate in static execution frameworks and cannot learn from their own experiences, limiting performance to design choices and LLM capabilities. A principled mechanism for self-improvement from past rollouts can overcome these bounds.

Method: After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction that summarizes key steps, dependencies, and constraints from its grounded experience. This abstraction is fed back as contextual guidance to refine the agent's policy for future executions, enabling more structured and informed subsequent runs. The approach is evaluated across diverse LLM backbones and SWE agent frameworks.

Result: SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across backbones and architectures. It achieves a 7.2% relative improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. On SWE-Bench Verified, it reaches 73.2% Pass@1 for Mini-SWE-Agent and 74% for OpenHands CodeAct.

Conclusion: Self-abstraction from grounded experience provides a principled, generalizable mechanism for self-improvement in LLM-based SWE agents, enabling more effective multi-step reasoning and code modification across architectures and backbones.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle
software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code
modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most
existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks,
lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own
experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by
the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose
Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables
agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior
through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise
plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps,
dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as
contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more
structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers
consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent
architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over
the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.
SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified
benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent
and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

perform exclusive experiments on various agentic benchmarks in both tool use
and coding domains. Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge-8B achieves state-of-the-art
performance among LLMs of similar size and remains competitive with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify awareness with knowledge and address de re/de dicto nuances; extend epistemic logic with new modalities and a robust semantic/axiomatic foundation using 2D-semantics.

Method: Define two modalities for de re and de dicto awareness, provide formal semantics via 2D-semantics, and develop a sound and complete axiomatization describing their interplay with the standard knowledge-of-the-fact modality.

Result: A sound and complete logical system that captures the interaction between the two proposed awareness modalities and knowledge of the fact under 2D-semantics.

Conclusion: Frames a novel, knowledge-like treatment of agent awareness, offering rigorous formal tools for reasoning about awareness and its interplay with knowledge; opens avenues for applications in AI and multi-agent epistemic reasoning.

Abstract: The paper proposes to treat agent awareness as a form of knowledge, breaking
the tradition in the existing literature on awareness. It distinguishes the de
re and de dicto forms of such knowledge. The work introduces two modalities
capturing these forms and formally specifies their meaning using a version of
2D-semantics. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system
describing the interplay between the two proposed modalities and the standard

*Lianrui Li,Dakuan Lu,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO) is a two-stage RL framework that uses self-reflection and error correction to improve large language models on hard mathematical problems; it shows improved performance on standard math benchmarks with limited external feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with challenging mathematical reasoning. There is a need for self-improvement mechanisms that leverage internal feedback (self-reflection) and error correction to boost performance without heavy external supervision.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) Trial-and-error learning with GRPO to collect incorrect answers and their questions into an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning where the model reflects on why its previous answers were wrong to guide future responses. Evaluation on math benchmarks (AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k) using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B.

Result: ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, indicating robust improvements in problem-solving accuracy. 

Conclusion: ScRPO is a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, potentially leading to more reliable and capable AI systems.

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on
challenging mathemati- cal problems by leveraging self-reflection and error
correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning
stage: training the model with GRPO and collect- ing incorrect answers along
with their cor- responding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction
learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous an- swers were
wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks,
including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH- 500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-
1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The ex- perimental results demonstrate that
ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings

*Wei Yang,Jiacheng Pang,Shixuan Li,Paul Bogdan,Stephen Tu,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro presents a principled, decoupled multi-agent framework for LLM collaboration, separating exploratory Execution Agents from a convergent Central Agent, and introduces Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO) to achieve clean credit assignment and stronger supervision, yielding consistent accuracy gains on math reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the core cognitive tension in LLM-based MAS: the need for broad exploration of the solution space versus principled convergence to the optimal solution, while mitigating premature consensus, error propagation, and credit assignment issues.

Method: Maestro deploys parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a Central Agent for evaluative synthesis. CLPO combines decision-focused policy gradients with a listwise ranking loss over justifications to disentangle strategic decisions from tactical rationales and improve credit assignment.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Maestro+CLPO outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering average absolute accuracy gains of about 6%, with improvements up to 10% in best cases.

Conclusion: Structurally separating exploration and synthesis coupled with CLPO provides cleaner credit assignment and stronger supervision, leading to robust improvements in reasoning tasks and general problem solving.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

*Stefano Ferraro,Akihiro Nakano,Masahiro Suzuki,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DLPWM is an unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents from pixels. It shows strong reconstruction/prediction and robustness to visual OOD, but policy learning on its latents underperforms DreamerV3 due to latent drift during multi-object interactions, indicating that mitigating representation drift is needed for stable control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether explicit disentangled object-level representations localized to task information can improve policy performance across novel feature combinations, supporting better compositional generalization and data efficiency in model-based RL.

Method: Introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised disentangled object-centric world model that extracts object-level latent representations directly from pixels. Evaluate reconstruction, prediction, and OOD robustness. Compare downstream model-based control performance to DreamerV3. Conduct latent-trajectory analyses to identify factors affecting policy stability, with a focus on representation drift during multi-object interactions.

Result: DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance and robustness to several OOD visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Latent-trajectory analyses reveal representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning.

Conclusion: Object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, but achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift to prevent representation shift. Future work should address latent drift to realize reliable control with OCWM.

Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

### [325] [MALinZero: Efficient Low-Dimensional Search for Mastering Complex Multi-Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06142)
*Sizhe Tang,Jiayu Chen,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MALinZero uses low-dimensional contextual linear bandit representations and LinUCT to enable efficient MCTS for multi-agent planning, with regret guarantees and a (1-1/e)-approximation for joint-action selection; achieves state-of-the-art on matrix games, SMAC, SMACv2 with faster learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent planning has exponential joint-action spaces; standard MCTS struggles to explore effectively. There is a need for scalable methods that reduce dimensionality while preserving meaningful action quality to balance exploration and exploitation.

Method: Project joint-action returns into a low-dimensional space using a contextual linear bandit formulation; solve with convex and μ-smooth loss; derive Linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees (LinUCT) to enable multi-agent exploration/exploitation in the low-dimensional space; perform regret analysis; propose a (1-1/e)-approximation for joint-action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2; outperforms both model-based and model-free MARL baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

Conclusion: MALinZero enables efficient, scalable MCTS in complex multi-agent planning by leveraging low-dimensional representations and LinUCT, supported by theoretical regret analysis and high empirical performance.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

*Fatima Jahara,Mark Dredze,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRIME uses logic grid puzzles to probe implicit gender biases in LLM deduction; shows models skew reasoning toward stereotypical associations; offers automatic generation, verification, and controlled experiments across puzzle variants; provides a framework for diagnosing and quantifying biases in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails suppress overt bias but subtler biases emerge during complex logical reasoning, which are not captured by existing evaluation benchmarks. There is a need for a framework that systematically probes how social stereotypes influence deductive reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Introduce PRIME: a set of logic grid puzzles with stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral variants derived from a common structure. Automatically generate and verify puzzles; vary puzzle size and biased settings; evaluate multiple model families; test prompt-based mitigation strategies; focus on gender stereotypes.

Result: Models show higher reasoning accuracy when solutions align with stereotypical associations, indicating bias in deductive reasoning. PRIME enables diagnosis and quantification of social biases in LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: PRIME provides a principled framework for diagnosing and quantifying implicit social biases in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, highlighting the importance of fairness in model evaluation and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

### [327] [Chasing Consistency: Quantifying and Optimizing Human-Model Alignment in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06168)
*Boxuan Wang,Zhuoyun Li,Xinmiao Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework introduces Alignment Score to measure semantic alignment between model reasoning and human reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT). It finds 2-hop reasoning yields the highest alignment, defines four error types contributing to misalignment, and proposes Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), which improves alignment by ~29.84% on longer (3-hop) reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and enhance the reliability of LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning by measuring semantic alignment with human references, diagnose failure modes through a defined error taxonomy, and propose an optimization sampling method to reduce alignment errors.

Method: Define Alignment Score as a metric for semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning and human references. Analyze four error types—logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal—and study their impact on Alignment Score. Empirically evaluate reasoning chains (notably 2-hop and 3-hop) and introduce Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS) to sample and favor chains with minimal alignment errors, aiming to improve scores.

Result: Empirically, 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. Four error types were identified and linked to score degradation. SCOS significantly boosts Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84%, especially for longer chains like 3-hop tasks.

Conclusion: A semantic-consistency objective (Alignment Score) provides a meaningful measure of CoT reliability. The proposed SCOS method can meaningfully improve alignment by prioritizing low-error reasoning chains, with notable gains on longer multi-hop tasks; this supports more reliable CoT-based reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

### [328] [CSP4SDG: Constraint and Information-Theory Based Role Identification in Social Deduction Games with LLM-Enhanced Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06175)
*Kaijie Xu,Fandi Meng,Clark Verbrugge,Simon Lucas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSP4SDG is a probabilistic constraint-satisfaction framework for hidden-role inference in social deduction games that uses four constraint classes, hard constraints with information-gain weighted soft constraints, yielding real-time interpretable posteriors and outperforming LLM baselines while boosting LLMs as a reasoning tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden-role inference is central and challenging in social deduction games; there is a need for principled, interpretable, scalable probabilistic reasoning as an alternative or complement to neural models.

Method: Map game events and dialogue to four constraint classes (evidence, phenomena, assertions, hypotheses). Apply hard constraints to prune impossible role assignments; use weighted soft constraints guided by information gain to score remaining hypotheses; employ a simple closed-form scoring rule ensuring truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimal error; compute a posterior over roles that is interpretable and updates in real time.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show CSP4SDG outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario and can boost LLMs when used as an auxiliary reasoning tool.

Conclusion: Principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory provides a scalable alternative or complement to heavy neural models for SDGs.

Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

Conclusion: Data Agent enables scalable, safe, non-expert-friendly data preparation for AI-ready tabular data, reducing human effort and improving data quality for AI workflows.

Abstract: The growing demand for AI applications in fields such as materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science has made data preparation an important but labor-intensive step. Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed "From Data to Better Data."

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight, automatic uncertainty-based verifier (UHeads) uses frozen LLM internal states to estimate step-level uncertainty, trained with automatic targets from a larger LLM or self-supervision, and outperforms much larger Process Reward Models across math, planning, and general knowledge QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods like PRMs are expensive, domain-limited, or need大量 annotations. A scalable, data-driven uncertainty signal could enable efficient, generalizable step-level verification.

Method: Train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that tap into the frozen LLM’s internal states to estimate uncertainty of each reasoning step. Target labels are generated automatically by a larger LLM or via self-supervision using the original model. UHeads contain <10M parameters.

Result: Across domains (mathematics, planning, general knowledge QA), UHeads match or surpass PRMs that are up to 810x larger, demonstrating effective, lightweight verification.

Conclusion: Internal states of LLMs encode uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, enabling scalable, introspective LLMs.

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 1.5B dense model using Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP) with two-stage distillation and MaxEnt-guided RL achieves competitive reasoning, beating much larger models on math benchmarks at a very low training cost, suggesting small models can rival large models and democratize AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging the common belief that scale alone yields robust reasoning, and demonstrating that small, cost-efficient models can match or exceed large models, potentially democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.

Method: Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP) comprising Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate diverse reasoning solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal; very low total training cost ($7,800) and comparison against various closed- and open-source models.

Result: 1.5B model outperforms 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on AIME24 (80.3 vs 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs 70.0), HMMT25 (50.4 vs 41.7). LiveCodeBench V6 score 51.1 (beats Magistral Medium 50.3). Comparable to GPT OSS-20B Medium; outperforms Magistral Medium and base models on some benchmarks; overall improved metrics relative to its base (6.7, 4.3, 0.6).

Conclusion: Small, cost-efficient models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models when guided by SSP, enabling dramatic reductions in training and inference costs and broadening access to advanced AI research.

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

### [332] [ROAR: Robust Accident Recognition and Anticipation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06226)
*Xingcheng Liu,Yanchen Guan,Haicheng Liao,Zhengbing He,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROAR is a robust accident anticipation framework that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self-adaptive object-aware module, and dynamic focal loss to handle noisy/incomplete data, sensor degradation, and data imbalance. It outperforms baselines on AP and mean Time to Accident (mTTA) across three datasets, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current accident anticipation methods often assume ideal sensing and data conditions, neglect sensor failures, environmental disturbances, data imperfections, and variability in driver behavior and accident rates across vehicle types. This limits reliability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: ROAR combines: (1) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for robust feature extraction from noisy/incomplete data; (2) a self-adaptive object-aware module to focus on high-risk vehicles and model spatial-temporal relationships among traffic agents; (3) dynamic focal loss to mitigate class imbalance between accident (positive) and non-accident (negative) samples.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three datasets—DAD, CCD, and A3D—showed that ROAR consistently outperforms existing baselines in Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA), while remaining robust to sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: ROAR offers a promising, reliable approach for accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments, advancing safety for autonomous vehicles by handling imperfect sensing and diverse driving conditions.

Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

Motivation: Governance constraints in high-stakes B2B AI delegation: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring information sufficiency before bargaining, and maintaining human oversight/auditability; gaps in prior work focusing on autonomous bargaining.

Method: GAIA specifies three roles (Principal, Delegate, Counterparty) and an optional Critic, and three mechanisms: information-gated progression with Task-Completeness Tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; dual feedback integration blending AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths; plus four safety invariants and a hybrid validation blueprint for evaluation.

Result: A formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants; information-gated progression via TCI and state transitions; dual feedback channels combining Critic suggestions with human oversight; a hybrid validation blueprint combining automated protocol metrics with human judgment; a reproducible specification for safe AI delegation that can be instantiated across domains.

Conclusion: GAIA bridges theory and practice, offering a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

### [334] [Synthetic Data-Driven Prompt Tuning for Financial QA over Tables and Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06292)
*Yaoning Yu,Kaimin Chang,Ye Yu,Kai Wei,Haojing Luo,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-improving prompt framework uses synthetic financial data, verifiers, and a prompt optimizer to iteratively refine prompts for financial reasoning with LLMs, achieving higher accuracy and robustness than standard prompts on DocMath-Eval without external labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt quality heavily affects numerical reasoning on financial documents. Fixed datasets and costly labeled data limit adaptability to new question types and document structures. A data-augmented, closed-loop approach aims to adapt prompts without external supervision.

Method: Generate synthetic financial tables and excerpts; verify correctness and robustness; use a prompt optimizer to refine the prompt based on verification outcomes; iterate in a closed-loop data-augmented optimization framework.

Result: On DocMath-Eval, the approach yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to standard prompting methods, demonstrating the benefit of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for finance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation in a self-improving loop can adapt prompts to unseen financial tasks without extra labeling, with promising implications for broader domains beyond finance.

Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

TL;DR: Secu-Table: a security-domain STI dataset with 1500+ tables and 15k+ entities built from CVE/CWE, annotated with Wikidata and SEPSES CSKG; released with code for SemTab challenges; baseline LLM evaluations provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security-specific STI research suffers from a lack of publicly available, domain-focused datasets. A public benchmark is needed to evaluate open and closed LLM-based STI methods in security contexts.

Method: Construct a dataset from CVE and CWE data, assemble 1500+ tables with 15k+ entities, annotate using Wikidata and SEPSES CSKG, and publicly release the dataset and accompanying code. Evaluate baseline STI with open-source LLMs (Falcon-3-7b-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct) and a GPT-4o mini model.

Result: The dataset comprises over 1500 tables and 15k+ entities; the authors publicly released the data and code and conducted preliminary baseline evaluations using Falcon-3-7b-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and GPT-4o mini. The abstract does not specify quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Secu-Table advances STI evaluation in the security domain by providing a public benchmark for Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching and supports the SemTab challenge, fostering open research on LLM-driven STI in security.

Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STATION is an open-world multi-agent environment enabling autonomous scientific discovery through emergent narratives, achieving state-of-the-art performance across math, computational biology, and machine learning benchmarks, and surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing, while yielding novel methods (e.g., density-adaptive scRNA-seq batch integration).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to explore decentralized, long-horizon scientific progress without a central coordinating system, enabled by agents with extended context windows who can read papers, form hypotheses, code, analyze, and publish, thereby accelerating discovery and enabling emergent methods.

Method: an open-world environment STATION where agents act with long-term planning and no central controller; agents read peers' papers, formulate hypotheses, submit code, analyze data, and publish results; evaluation across multiple benchmarks; emergent narratives and cumulative history drive innovation.

Result: achieves new state-of-the-art on benchmarks from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning; outperforms AlphaEvolve in circle packing; reveals emergent methods such as a density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration.

Conclusion: this work demonstrates a step toward autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in open-world AI, proposing a paradigm beyond rigid optimization.

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

### [337] [ALIGN: A Vision-Language Framework for High-Accuracy Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06316)
*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIGN is a vision-language framework for inferring accident coordinates from Bangla news using OCR and map cues, outperforming traditional geoparsers with no retraining; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In data-scarce regions, there is a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Multilingual, unstructured news hampers existing geoparsers, necessitating a system that can reason spatially across text and maps.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline (ALIGN) that combines OCR, linguistic reasoning via large language/vision-language models, and grid-based map verification. It evaluates predicted locations against contextual and visual evidence to produce interpretable, fine-grained geolocations without retraining.

Result: Consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites in Bangla-language news; provides a reliable foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions.

Conclusion: ALIGN enables evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and showcases the broader integration of multimodal AI in transportation analytics; code is open-source at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LPFQA is a long-tail, knowledge-based benchmark sourced from authentic professional forums across 20 fields, comprising 502 tasks with fine-grained evaluation across knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; it uses hierarchical difficulty, authentic user personas, and interdisciplinary knowledge integration, revealing notable performance gaps among 12 mainstream LLMs and offering a discriminative tool for advancing model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on simplified tasks or synthetic scenarios, failing to capture long-tail knowledge, real-world complexity, and professional applicability. LPFQA aims to provide an authentic, discriminative benchmark that evaluates deep knowledge, reasoning, terminology, and contextual analysis across diverse domains to better guide LLM development.

Method: Derive 502 tasks from authentic professional forums spanning 20 academic and industrial fields; introduce four fine-grained evaluation dimensions (knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology, contextual analysis); implement a hierarchical difficulty structure ensuring semantic clarity and unique answers; model authentic professional scenarios with realistic user personas; evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA.

Result: Evaluations revealed significant performance disparities among LLMs, particularly in specialized reasoning tasks, highlighting LPFQA's sensitivity to nuanced professional knowledge.

Conclusion: LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

### [339] [What Makes Reasoning Invalid: Echo Reflection Mitigation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06380)
*Chen He,Xun Jiang,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AEPO is a reinforcement learning framework that tackles Echo Reflection in LLM reasoning by filtering information flow during reflection and adaptively balancing exploration and exploitation, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to generate novel insights during the reflection stage on tasks with complex domain-specific knowledge, tending to echo earlier reasoning steps. This is attributed to (1) uncontrollable information flow that propagates premature intermediate thoughts and distorts final answers, and (2) insufficient internal exploration during reflection that repeats earlier findings. Addressing these defects is critical for robust complex reasoning.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) with two components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies cognitive information flow and prevents premature thoughts from shaping the final answer; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically tunes exploration vs. exploitation across reasoning stages to encourage reflective diversity and correctness.

Result: Extensive experiments show AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: AEPO mitigates Echo Reflection by controlling information flow and promoting adaptive exploratory reasoning, enabling improved performance and broader applicability to tasks demanding complex domain knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

*Dachuan Lin,Guobin Shen,Zihao Yang,Tianrong Liu,Dongcheng Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cost-efficient three-agent SLM debate framework for safety judging; introduces HAJailBench with 12k annotated jailbreak interactions; shows SLM-based judges approach GPT-4o performance at lower cost; three debate rounds are optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety evaluation of LLMs is increasingly performed via LLM-as-a-Judge, but frontier-model costs hinder scalability. There is a need for scalable, cost-effective evaluation using smaller language models without sacrificing judgment quality.

Method: SLMs act as three agents (critic, defender, judge) engaging in structured debates to judge safety; HAJailBench is a large-scale, human-annotated jailbreak benchmark with 12,000 adversarial interactions across multiple attack methods and target models; experiments compare SLM judges to GPT-4o and include ablations on the number of debate rounds.

Result: SLM-based framework achieves agreement with GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost; three rounds of debate provide the best balance between accuracy and efficiency; HAJailBench supplies fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability.

Conclusion: Structured, value-aligned debates enable SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks; HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

### [341] [SofT-GRPO: Surpassing Discrete-Token LLM Reinforcement Learning via Gumbel-Reparameterized Soft-Thinking Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06411)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SofT-GRPO introduces a policy-gradient method for soft-thinking LLMs, using Gumbel noise and Gumbel-Softmax to keep soft-thinking within the embedding space, achieving modest Pass@1 gains and notable Pass@32 gains over discrete-token GRPO across 1.5B–7B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft-thinking can outperform discrete-token CoT in some scenarios, but applying reinforcement learning to soft-thinking is challenging due to injecting stochasticity into tokens and updating soft-thinking policies; prior soft-thinking + GRPO efforts underperform discrete-token GRPO.

Method: Injects Gumbel noise into logits; applies Gumbel-Softmax to sample within the pre-trained embedding space; uses the reparameterization trick in policy gradient; builds SofT-GRPO on top of GRPO to optimize soft-thinking policies across LLMs (1.5B–7B).

Result: Across base LLMs 1.5B–7B, SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% average) and show a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% average).

Conclusion: SofT-GRPO advances reinforcement learning for soft-thinking in LLMs, narrowing the gap with discrete-token GRPO and enabling better overall performance; code and weights are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

*Xiangwu Guo,Difei Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Auto-Explorer automates GUI data collection with minimal annotations, enabling rapid fine-tuning of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for GUI tasks; UIXplore benchmarks exploration quality; results show faster and more effective adaptation to new software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents require large GUI datasets to interpret natural language commands, but data collection is hard. Common Crawl-based approaches miss desktop apps and new websites. There's a need for rapid, low-annotation data collection to adapt to new software in personalized scenarios.

Method: Auto-Explorer uses an autonomous exploration mechanism to parse and explore GUI environments, collecting data with minimal annotations (including GUI states, elements, bounding boxes). The UIXplore benchmark assesses the quality of exploration by creating environments where explorer agents discover and save software states. The gathered data is used to fine-tune a multimodal LLM and to create a GUI element grounding testing set.

Result: Experiments show that Auto-Explorer outperforms baselines in quickly enhancing an MLLM's capabilities on explored software, indicating efficient data collection and effective grounding. The UIXplore benchmark provides a meaningful measure of exploration quality.

Conclusion: The proposed Auto-Explorer framework reduces annotation costs while enabling rapid adaptation of MLLMs to new GUI software. The UIXplore benchmark offers a practical evaluation platform for GUI exploration strategies, and the approach demonstrates strong potential for personalized GUI interfacing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

*Jingyu Hu,Shu Yang,Xilin Gong,Hongming Wang,Weiru Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MONICA monitors reasoning steps for sycophancy and calibrates in real time to reduce incorrect agreement, improving reliability during and after generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models frequently display sycophantic behavior, agreeing with users’ incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. This undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Existing methods mainly evaluate final answers and post-hoc corrections, missing the dynamics during reasoning.

Method: MONICA introduces a monitor-guided calibration framework with a real-time sycophancy monitor that tracks drift scores during each reasoning step and a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds; the system operates during inference without requiring the model to finish generating the full answer.

Result: Across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs, MONICA reduces sycophanic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Conclusion: Monitoring and calibrating the reasoning trajectory is effective for mitigating sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models; MONICA offers a practical, inference-time solution to improve reliability without waiting for final answers.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDTR is a decoding strategy that uses eight topological risk features plus Dirichlet-based uncertainty to calibrate LLM-generated chain-of-thought across multiple reasoning paths, yielding improved calibration and accuracy on math and reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable confidence estimates in chain-of-thought reasoning with LLMs for safe deployment; current calibration methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions.

Method: Treat each CoT as a high-dimensional vector and extract eight topological risk features that capture the geometric structure of reasoning distributions; combine these with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to assess confidence across multiple reasoning paths; evaluate against three state-of-the-art calibration methods on four benchmarks (AIME, GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, stock price prediction).

Result: EDTR achieves 41% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672; attains perfect accuracy on AIME and strong calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107; baselines exhibit severe overconfidence.

Conclusion: EDTR provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

*Mingde "Harry" Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A thesis on improving RL generalization through conscious-like planning: spatial abstraction for dynamic attention, Skipper for task decomposition, and a feasibility evaluator to curb delusional planning, with directions toward general task abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization of RL to unseen environments and long-horizon planning, inspired by human conscious planning abilities.

Method: Introduce a top-down attention mechanism called spatial abstraction that lets a decision-time planning agent focus on the most relevant environmental aspects; develop Skipper to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks; identify a failure mode where planning agents relying on generative state targets hallucinate and propose a feasibility evaluator to reject infeasible targets.

Result: Significant improvements in systematic generalization beyond training tasks; robustness to distributional shifts; improved performance in long-term, compositional planning; safety gains by mitigating delusional planning through feasibility evaluation.

Conclusion: Future work should pursue general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning, along with safer, more reliable planning agents that can reason across varied environments.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

### [346] [GHOST: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem on Graphs of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06471)
*Jingtao Tang,Hang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST provides an exact, hierarchical solver for the Graph of Convex Sets TSP (GCS-TSP) that combines tour search with convex trajectory optimization, using abstract-path unfolding for admissible lower bounds to enable strong pruning; it guarantees optimality (with a bounded-suboptimal variant) and outperforms MICP baselines in many cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCS-TSP arises in trajectory planning when the configuration space is decomposed into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In such settings, edge costs depend on the specific trajectory through each region, making traditional TSP approaches inapplicable. There is a need for an exact, efficient solver that accounts for trajectory-dependent costs and high-order continuity constraints.

Method: GHOST uses a two-level hierarchy: a high-level best-first search over tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, and a low-level search over feasible GCS paths realizing a tour. A novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm computes admissible lower bounds to guide the search, enabling strong pruning and reducing convex optimization calls. The framework provides a formal optimality guarantee and a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical use.

Result: Empirical results show GHOST is orders of magnitude faster than unified MICP baselines for simple cases and can handle complex trajectory planning problems, including high-order continuity constraints and incomplete GCS representations.

Conclusion: GHOST advances GCS-TSP by delivering guaranteed optimality (with a practical bounded-suboptimal option) and substantial computational efficiency, enabling effective trajectory planning in realistic, convex-region-based configuration spaces.

Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

### [347] [FractalBench: Diagnosing Visual-Mathematical Reasoning Through Recursive Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06522)
*Jan Ondras,Marek Šuppa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FractalBench exposes a large gap between syntactic code generation and true mathematical understanding in multimodal LLMs, with only about 4% of attempts capturing underlying fractal rules despite 76% producing valid code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether multimodal AI can generalize abstract symbolic rules from visual patterns by evaluating fractal program synthesis, thereby probing visual-mathematical reasoning and abstraction capabilities.

Method: Introduce FractalBench benchmark and evaluate four leading MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen 2.5-VL) on 12 canonical fractals. Task: generate executable Python code that reproduces each fractal, enabling objective evaluation.

Result: 983? (Note: The content states: 76% produce syntactically valid code; 4% capture mathematical structure; performance varies by fractal type: Koch curves 17-21%, trees <2%).

Conclusion: FractalBench serves as a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning, revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction in current multimodal models; the benchmark and results are publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

*Moriya Dechtiar,Daniel Martin Katz,Mari Sundaresan,Sylvain Jaume,Hongming Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, converts contracts into semantic graphs and uses a reinforcement-learning LLM with gated GRPO to segment, extract entities/relationships, and reveal direct and hidden dependencies, enabling graph-based contract analysis and linting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contracts are dense, error-prone, and difficult to review in a linear, manual fashion. A graph-based representation enables automated, data-driven analysis and visualization.

Method: Proposes an ontology mapping core contract elements to graph nodes/edges; employs a reinforcement-learning LLM framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships; integrates group relative policy optimization (GRPO) with a graph-metric reward; introduces a gated GRPO variant to enhance learning signals.

Result: DEMonstrates automatic identification of direct clause relationships and hidden dependencies; provides a strong learning signal; shifts contract analysis from linear reading to graph visualization; lays groundwork for graph-based linting of contracts.

Conclusion: Graph-based contract analysis is feasible and beneficial, enabling dynamic, data-driven review workflows and paving the way for automated linting and more robust contract management.

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

### [349] [Spilling the Beans: Teaching LLMs to Self-Report Their Hidden Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06626)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A supervised fine-tuning method (SRFT) trains models to admit factual mistakes, boosting honesty and enabling detection of hidden misaligned objectives. It yields near-perfect interrogation performance and recovers substantial details about hidden goals in OOD stealth tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety checks by interrogating models can fail because models may lie. There is a need for a training objective that encourages models to disclose errors and misaligned objectives to enable auditing and safer deployment of AI agents.

Method: Self-Report Fine-Tuning (SRFT): a simple supervised fine-tuning approach where models are trained to admit factual mistakes when prompted. The method is evaluated in OOD stealth tasks where a hidden misaligned objective is pursued alongside a user objective, and interrogation is used to detect and recover details about the hidden objective. Comparisons are made against baseline models and prefilled-turn attacks.

Result: SRFT increases honesty, enabling near-ceiling detection of hidden objectives (F1 ≈ 0.98) versus 0 with baselines. It also recovers 28–100% of hidden-objective details, compared with 0% in baselines and prefilled-turn attacks.

Conclusion: SRFT is a promising approach to promote honesty propensity in AI systems and to aid in incriminating misaligned AI, with strong empirical results in OOD stealth tasks; further work is needed to scale and assess broader safety implications.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

*Fei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces SRNN, a brain-inspired model that unifies object attributes, relations, and timeline via Hebbian learning to generate scene language; challenges usual pretrain-finetune with a predefined-then-finetune paradigm; shows competitive CLEVRER results, analyzes bias, and offers interpretable diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between human intuitive physics and machines by adopting brain-inspired, unified representations and learning rules, enabling perception-language fusion and better error diagnosis.

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN) with dedicated What and How pathways, unified representation for attributes/relations/timeline, Hebbian Fire Together, Wire Together learning, and a predefined-then-finetune training regime; outputs structured linguistic descriptions of visual scenes; evaluated on CLEVRER with bias analysis and interpretability tests.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on CLEVRER; reveals benchmark bias; demonstrates white-box diagnostic capability for errors.

Conclusion: Evidence for viability of translating biological intelligence concepts into engineered systems for intuitive physics, and a call for holistic evaluation and transparent error analysis.

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

### [351] [MathSE: Improving Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning via Self-Evolving Iterative Reflection and Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06805)
*Jinhao Chen,Zhen Yang,Jianxin Shi,Tianyu Wo,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathSE: A self-evolving framework for multimodal LLMs that uses iterative inference, reflection, and an Outcome Reward Model to improve mathematical reasoning; shows strong gains on MathVL-test, outperforming the open-source model QVQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs rely on static, teacher-derived datasets and one-shot fine-tuning, which limit generalization and iterative reasoning depth needed for complex math problems.

Method: Iterative fine-tuning cycles with inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. It uses correct reasoning paths from previous inferences and reflections from an Outcome Reward Model to guide subsequent updates.

Result: Significant performance gains over backbone models on challenging benchmarks; on MathVL-test, it surpasses the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ.

Conclusion: MathSE demonstrates a self-evolving approach to improve mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, enabling better generalization and adaptability beyond traditional fine-tuning; code and models are released.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

*Xinran Li,Xiujuan Xu,Jiaqi Qiao,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRC-Emo is a training framework for ERC that blends Prompt engineering, Demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning to enhance LLM-based emotion understanding in dialogue, achieving state-of-the-art results on IEMOCAP and MELD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs currently struggle to fully capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions in conversational contexts; improving this capability could yield more accurate emotion recognition and better human–computer interaction.

Method: Propose emotion-sensitive prompt templates that exploit both explicit and implicit emotional cues; build a dedicated demonstration retrieval repository including standard dataset samples, high-quality LLM-generated examples, and manual verifications; integrate curriculum learning into LoRA fine-tuning by weighting emotional shifts across same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to create an easy-to-hard training sequence.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks (IEMOCAP and MELD), demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability of the PRC-Emo framework for LLM-based ERC.

Conclusion: PRC-Emo shows that combining prompt design, curated demonstrations, and curriculum-aware fine-tuning can significantly strengthen LLM-based emotion recognition in conversation, with potential benefits for more nuanced and natural human-computer dialogue.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

### [354] [Improving Region Representation Learning from Urban Imagery with Noisy Long-Caption Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07062)
*Yimei Zhang,Guojiang Shen,Kaili Ning,Tongwei Ren,Xuebo Qiu,Mengmeng Wang,Xiangjie Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrbanLN is a pre-training framework that uses long-text captions and noise suppression to improve urban region representation learning. It introduces an information-preserved stretching interpolation to align long captions with fine-grained visuals, a data-level multi-model caption generation pipeline, and a model-level momentum-based self-distillation for robust cross-modal learning under noisy captions. Demonstrates superior performance across four cities and multiple downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban region representations must capture fine-grained visual cues of dynamic city scenes and be enriched with textual knowledge. However, aligning long textual captions with imagery is challenging, and LLM-generated captions introduce noise that can degrade learning. A method that preserves long-text semantics while suppressing noise could significantly improve cross-modal city representations.

Method: 1) Information-preserved stretching interpolation to align long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. 2) Data-level: multi-model collaboration pipeline to automatically generate diverse and reliable captions without human input. 3) Model-level: momentum-based self-distillation to produce stable pseudo-targets, enabling robust cross-modal learning under noisy captions.

Result: Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and multiple downstream tasks show that UrbanLN achieves superior performance compared to baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-text aware, noise-suppressing urban region representation learning.

Conclusion: UrbanLN successfully integrates long-text knowledge with visual representations, addressing alignment and noise challenges in cross-modal urban region learning. Its data- and model-level strategies offer a robust framework that can be extended to other domains involving long textual descriptions and noisy captions.

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RedOne 2.0 presents a 4B SNS-focused LLM trained with a three-stage RL-prioritized post-training pipeline (Exploratory Learning, Targeted Fine-Tuning, Refinement) to achieve data-efficient, robust SNS adaptation, outperforming larger baselines with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNS platforms pose heterogeneous workloads, rapid shifts in norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse data that cause distribution shift; smaller models benefit from stable, data-efficient domain adaptation.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to identify weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning refining only diagnosed gaps while mixing some general data to mitigate forgetting; (3) Refinement Learning re-applying RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate gains and balance tasks.

Result: The 4B RedOne 2.0 achieves average improvements of about 2.41 over a 7B sub-optimal baseline and about 8.74 lift from the base model, with less than half the data required by prior SFT-centric RedOne, indicating better data efficiency and stability at compact scale.

Conclusion: RedOne 2.0 provides a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS environments, improving capability while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainability by integrating LLM reasoning into formal decision workflows, moving beyond post-hoc feature attribution to auditable decision traces.

Method: Proposes a layered architecture that separates the LLM's reasoning space from the explainable process space and embeds LLMs into decision models (QOC, sensitivity analysis, game theory, risk management) with empirical evaluation in governance and analysis domains.

Result: The system reproduces human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning, indicating that LLM-driven standard processes can support reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Conclusion: LLMs embedded in formal analytical processes can transform opaque inference into transparent, auditable decisions, providing a foundation for trustworthy, interpretable AI in decision-making contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

TL;DR: Modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts, combining Vester's Sensitivity Model, normal-form games, and sequential games with swappable modules; demonstrates traceability and competitive LLM-driven evaluation in logistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce opacity of LLMs in decision support by externalizing reasoning into auditable artifacts and ensuring traceability; to integrate game-theoretic frameworks for structured decision analysis.

Method: Build a pipeline with modular swappable components across three frameworks: (i) Vester's Sensitivity Model (factors, signed impact, systemic roles, feedback loops); (ii) normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); (iii) sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree, backward induction). Pair LLMs (default GPT-5) with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and role classification; generate auditable intermediates; evaluate on 100 logistics runs; LLM judge with eight-criterion rubric.

Result: Factor alignment with human baseline: 55.5% across 26 factors; 62.9% on transport-core subset; role agreement over matches: 57%; LLM judge scoring equal to reconstructed human baseline.

Conclusion: Configurable LLM pipelines can replicate expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI sustainability tooling is heterogeneous and often omits water and value-chain impacts, hindering comparability, reproducibility, and holistic assessment of energy, carbon, water, and embodied burdens across hardware, software, and deployment stages.

Method: Formalizes a five-phase AI lifecycle aligned with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages; defines governance via Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; systematizes hardware and system-level strategies along the edge-cloud continuum; and introduces a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering for reproducible, provider-agnostic comparisons.

Result: A coherent framework and terminology: (1) a distinct operational definition of Green AI, (2) a mapped five-phase lifecycle tied to LCA, (3) governance structure via PDCA, (4) compiled hardware/system strategies across edge-cloud, and (5) a measurement framework enabling reproducible benchmarking across facilities, systems, devices, and workloads.

Conclusion: The work offers actionable, evidence-based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers by integrating definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement to reduce multi-dimensional burdens and enable comparable assessments across providers.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and reason about the impact of inconsistencies in DL knowledge bases by assigning costs to violated axioms and assertions, and to determine the computational feasibility of query answers under these costs; to extend prior work (EL_bot to ALCO) to richer DLs with inverse roles and role inclusions; and to identify precise data-complexity bounds.

Method: Define cost-based semantics that assign a cost to each interpretation based on violated axioms/assertions; analyze the set of optimal-cost interpretations to derive certain and possible answers; perform complexity analysis to sharpen lower bounds and determine whether upper bounds exist; prove first-order rewritability for fixed-cost bound in DL-Lite^H_bool to obtain TC0 data complexity.

Result: Established precise data-complexity for optimal-cost certain answers and refined lower bounds for cost-based querying semantics; demonstrated that, for DL-Lite^H_bool ontologies with a fixed cost bound, instance-query certain answers and conjunctive-query possible answers can be computed via a first-order rewriting, yielding the minimal data complexity class TC0.

Conclusion: Cost-based semantics can yield tractable data complexity in meaningful DL settings; first-order rewritability under a fixed cost bound enables efficient query answering (TC0) for certain DL-Lite scenarios, extending the practical applicability of cost-aware querying to more expressive ontologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

*Diego Gosmar,Anna Chiara Pallotta,Giovanni Zenezini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence in supply chains using agentic AI; shows HITL and multi-agent AI dramatically reduce energy, emissions, and water usage versus manual processes; includes ESG-based governance and a replicable use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address environmental impact and governance in document-intensive supply chain automation, leveraging agentic AI to improve efficiency while lowering ecological footprint.

Method: Develop an ESG-oriented methodology integrating performance, energy, and emission indicators; compare three deployment scenarios: manual, AI-assisted HITL, and advanced multi-agent agentic AI with parsers/verifiers; empirical evaluation on document extraction tasks; replicability case study.

Result: AI-assisted and agentic AI approaches cut energy 70–90%, CO2 90–97%, and water 89–98% vs manual; full agentic systems yield substantial sustainability gains even with slight increases in resource usage relative to simpler AI-assisted solutions.

Conclusion: The framework enables ESG-aware assessment and governance of AI-enabled supply chain solutions; demonstrates replicable real-world application and the potential of agentic AI to deliver sustainability gains in document-intensive workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

*Yuanshao Zhu,Xiangyu Zhao,Zijian Zhang,Xuetao Wei,James Jianqiao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight architecture with progressive local-global fusion (PLGF) and a dual-space, difficulty-aware loss (DualFocal Loss) to efficiently and accurately infer fine-grained urban flow, achieving substantial model compression and accuracy gains on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two key issues hinder deployment: (1) over-parameterized models leading to high computational cost, and (2) skewed distribution of urban flows causing standard losses to underperform. A unified approach is needed to balance efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Method: Introduce PLGF, a Progressive Local-Global Fusion architecture that captures fine-grained details and global context with reduced parameters. Propose DualFocal Loss, integrating dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism to emphasize hard regions during training.

Result: Experiments on 4 real-world scenarios show state-of-the-art performance. PLGF reduces model size by up to 97% while maintaining or improving accuracy; with comparable parameter budgets, accuracy improves by over 10% against strong baselines. Implementation available at GitHub repo.

Conclusion: The proposed PLGF and DualFocal Loss provide a unified, scalable solution for precise urban flow inference, reconciling efficiency and accuracy for practical deployment.

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

*Junji Hou,Junzhou Zhao,Shuo Zhang,Pinghui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE) to detect Time-Series Large Model (TSLM) outputs by exploiting uncertainty contraction under recursive forecasting; provides theoretical proof and empirical validation across 32 datasets, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are rising risks of data misuse and fabrication with synthetic time series. Existing detectors for model-generated text do not transfer to time series due to lower information density and smoother distributions, necessitating a modality-specific detector.

Method: Formulates the contraction hypothesis: model-generated time series exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting; proves it under assumptions about model behavior and time-series structure; introduces Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes.

Result: Empirical validation across diverse datasets shows UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: UCE provides a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series, contributing to trustworthy data handling.

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

### [363] [MENTOR: A Metacognition-Driven Self-Evolution Framework for Uncovering and Mitigating Implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07107)
*Liang Shan,Kaicheng Shen,Wen Wu,Zhenyu Ying,Chaochao Lu,Guangze Ye,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A metacognition-driven, self-evolving framework (MENTOR) mitigates implicit domain-specific risks in LLMs by combining metacognitive self-assessment, dynamic rule knowledge graphs, and activation steering, validated through defensive testing across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address implicit, domain-specific risks in LLM alignment that are not captured by existing bias/hate/violence safeguards, and achieve a generalizable, low-maintenance framework for diverse specialized fields.

Method: Propose MENTOR: a metacognition-driven self-evolution framework. Introduce a metacognitive self-assessment tool for reflection on value misalignment. Release a 9,000-query domain risk dataset (education, finance, management). Dynamically generate supplementary rule knowledge graphs from reflective outcomes to extend static rule trees. Use activation steering during inference to enforce rules. Evaluate with defensive testing across three domains comparing to human evaluators.

Result: MENTOR substantially reduces semantic attack success rates in three vertical domains. Metacognitive assessment aligns with baseline human evaluators and provides more thorough and insightful analysis of value alignment.

Conclusion: MENTOR offers a flexible, generalizable framework to uncover and mitigate implicit risks in LLMs across domain tasks, enabling continuous self-evolution with reduced maintenance costs, and provides a cost-effective enforcement mechanism via activation steering.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cooperative Market Making (CMM) distills LLM-driven market-making by decoupling features across layer, task, and data, and fusing them via a Hájek-MoE ensemble; delivers superior performance over distillation baselines and RL-based MM on four real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for market making but suffer from slow inference. There is little work on distilling LLMs for market-making tasks, motivating a lightweight, modular distillation framework that preserves essential LLM features.

Method: Introduce a normalized fluorescent probe to study LLM features. Based on findings, CMM decouples LLM features along three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Multiple student models learn simple, feature-specific representations, each handling a distinct dimension. A Hájek-MoE aggregates outputs in a kernel-generated common feature space, weighting each model's contribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world market datasets demonstrate that CMM outperforms existing distillation methods and RL-based market-making strategies.

Conclusion: CMM provides an effective, modular approach to distilling LLMs for market making. The Hájek-MoE ensemble successfully integrates diverse feature representations, yielding superior performance and offering practical gains in efficiency over full LLM deployment.

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic pipeline uses saliency-guided clustering and LLM-based symbolic reasoning to uncover latent subclasses in multiclass time series data, outperforming signal-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and discover latent subclass structure in time series classification by integrating neural saliency with symbolic reasoning.

Method: Train binary-subsumed classifiers using label subsumption; derive gradient-based saliency maps; group input signals by predicted class; cluster under three configurations; use centroids as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to identify latent subclasses.

Result: Saliency-driven approach effectively discovers latent subclasses and improves clustering performance, outperforming signal-only baselines on standard time series datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that combining gradient-based saliency with symbolic reasoning yields interpretable latent subclass discovery in time series classification, advancing knowledge discovery in neuro-symbolic AI.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

TL;DR: LLM-powered OSN simulator enabling parallel counterfactual evaluation of moderation strategies; finds agents are psychologically realistic, shows social contagion effects, and that personalized moderation outperforms generic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address uncertainty about real-world moderation effectiveness due to data collection costs and limited experimental control; leverage LLMs to simulate human-like agents and run counterfactual experiments.

Method: Design and implement a large language model–powered OSN conversation simulator; run parallel counterfactual simulations where moderation interventions influence toxic behavior while keeping other factors constant; conduct extensive experiments to assess realism, contagion, and moderation performance.

Result: Demonstrates psychological realism of OSN agents, emergence of social contagion phenomena, and superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

Conclusion: LLM-powered simulations enable robust, cost-effective evaluation of moderation interventions, providing insights into the benefits of personalized moderation and a scalable framework for OSN moderation research.

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

*Hohei Chan,Xinzhi Zhang,Antao Xiang,Weinan Zhang,Mengchen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PADiff uses a diffusion-based policy for ad hoc teamwork to capture multimodal cooperation and adapt to non-stationary teammates, outperforming existing methods across three environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AHT requires ego agents to collaborate with unseen teammates; single-policy RL tends to collapse to a single behavior and miss multimodal cooperation. Need methods that model multimodality and non-stationarity.

Method: Proposes PADiff, a diffusion-based policy that captures multimodal behaviors and embeds predictive teammate information into the denoising process to adapt during non-stationary AHT scenarios.

Result: Empirical evaluation across three cooperation environments shows PADiff significantly outperforms existing AHT methods.

Conclusion: PADiff effectively models multimodal cooperation and adapts to changing teammates, advancing AHT performance.

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent SciML framework (AgenticSciML) with 10+ specialized AI agents collaboratively proposing, critiquing, and refining architectures and training methods via structured debate, memory, and evolutionary search achieves large error reductions and discovers novel strategies beyond the existing knowledge base, indicating emergent, scalable autonomous discovery in scientific computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SciML design currently relies on expert-driven experimentation to craft architectures, losses, and training strategies. This process is time-consuming and lacks scalable autonomous discovery. The work proposes a collaborative, multi-agent approach to automate and accelerate methodological innovation in SciML.

Method: A collaborative system of over 10 specialized AI agents that engage in structured debate, use retrieval-augmented method memory, and apply ensemble-guided evolutionary search to generate and critique new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. The framework explores physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, producing adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models.

Result: The framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks. Agents propose novel strategies not present in the curated knowledge base.

Conclusion: Collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

*Chen Han,Yijia Ma,Jin Tan,Wenzhen Zheng,Xijin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ED2D is an evidence-based multi-agent debate framework for misinformation detection that retrieves factual evidence, acts as a debunker and persuasive system, and shows both promise and risks; it outperforms baselines on three benchmarks, but misclassifications can reinforce misconceptions unless carefully managed; a public site supports transparency and critical thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to move beyond detection accuracy toward transparent reasoning and user resilience to misinformation. MAD transcripts can illuminate reasoning paths, offering interpretable debunking and education, while preserving adversarial dynamics essential for robust detection.

Method: Extend prior MAD with factual evidence retrieval (ED2D), designing it as a persuasive multi-agent system that produces debunking transcripts to correct beliefs and discourage sharing. Compare ED2D-generated transcripts with human-expert ones across three misinformation detection benchmarks and deploy a public community website to enhance transparency and collaboration.

Result: ED2D outperforms existing baselines on three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D makes correct predictions, its debunking transcripts persuade as effectively as human experts; when ED2D misclassifies, its explanations may inadvertently reinforce misconceptions even alongside accurate human explanations.

Conclusion: MAD-based misinformation intervention holds promise for transparency and user resilience but carries risks; careful design is needed to prevent reinforcement of false beliefs from misclassifications. Public facing tools can foster transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IterResearch introduces an iterative, memory-based deep-research paradigm that reframes long-horizon tasks as an MDPM with workspace reconstruction, paired with Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization to enable scalable, efficient exploration. It achieves strong gains and scales interactions, improving both open-source agents and frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mono-contextual agents accumulate information in a single expanding context window, causing context suffocation and noise that degrade long-horizon reasoning.

Method: Propose IterResearch: reformulate long-horizon research as Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction; maintain an evolving report as memory; periodically synthesize insights; develop EAPO with geometric reward discounting and adaptive downsampling for stable distributed training.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows average +14.5 percentage points across six benchmarks; narrows gap to frontier proprietary systems; interaction scaling up to 2048 steps with performance gains from 3.5% to 42.5%; improves frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: IterResearch offers versatile long-horizon reasoning, effective as a trained agent and as a prompting strategy for frontier models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage, taxonomy-guided engine called DEEPPERSONA builds a large, hierarchical human-attribute taxonomy from real chats and samples attributes to generate deep, narrative-complete synthetic personas, achieving greater diversity and realism and improving downstream personalization and alignment benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic personas are shallow and fail to capture the complexity of real human identities, limiting applications in agentic simulation, personalization, and AI alignment. A scalable, privacy-free solution with richer attribute content is needed.

Method: Stage 1: Construct a large human-attribute taxonomy (hundreds of attributes) by mining real user–ChatGPT conversations. Stage 2: Progressively sample attributes from the taxonomy to generate coherent personas with hundreds of structured attributes and around 1 MB of narrative text per persona, yielding narrative-complete synthetic profiles.

Result: Intrinsic: attribute coverage up by 32% and profile uniqueness up by 44% versus baselines. Extrinsic: improved GPT-4.1-mini personalized QA accuracy by 11.6% across ten metrics; narrows real-human response gaps in social surveys by 31.7%; Big Five gap reduced by 17% relative to other LLM-simulated citizens.

Conclusion: DEEPPERSONA offers a scalable, privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research, enabling richer personas for better evaluation and alignment of AI systems.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

TL;DR: DigiData offers a large, diverse, multi-modal mobile UI dataset and DigiData-Bench for real-world task evaluation, paired with dynamic and AI-powered evaluation methods that outperform traditional step-accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile-control datasets often rely on unstructured goals and simplistic metrics, hindering reliable training and evaluation of agents. There is a need for high-quality data and robust evaluation to advance mobile control agents.

Method: DigiData is built by exhaustive feature exploration of apps to create diverse, complex goals. DigiData-Bench provides real-world task benchmarks. The paper also introduces dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluation methods to assess agents beyond step-accuracy.

Result: The authors argue that step-accuracy is insufficient for mobile control, and they propose dynamic and AI-powered evaluations as more reliable alternatives; the dataset and benchmark are intended to accelerate development of mobile control agents.

Conclusion: DigiData and DigiData-Bench are expected to significantly advance mobile control agents and improve human-device interactions through better data and evaluation standards.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TumorMap introduces a robotic platform with a three-laser system (OCT, endogenous fluorescence, and cutting laser) and deep learning to autonomously delineate intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and perform noncontact, submillimeter tumor resections, validated in murine tumor models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome intraoperative tumor resection challenges: lack of high-fidelity 3D tumor reconstructions, difficulty generalizing tissue models for tumor heterogeneity, and physical limits of manual/surgeon fatigue and tremor that hinder precise resection.

Method: Integrates a three-laser mechanism (OCT, laser-induced endogenous fluorescence, and cutting laser scalpel) with deep learning to formulate intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and perform autonomous tissue resection. Includes a novel histopathological workflow to estimate sensor performance and validates the system in murine osteosarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma models.

Result: Achieves submillimeter laser resection accuracy and demonstrates fully automated, noncontact tumor surgery guided by multimodal sensors without human intervention; validated in mouse tumor models with a new histopathology workflow for sensor performance estimation.

Conclusion: TumorMap shows the feasibility of autonomous, sensor-guided tumor surgery with high precision, addressing key intraoperative challenges and reducing reliance on surgeon-operated resection.

Abstract: Surgical resection of malignant solid tumors is critically dependent on the
surgeon's ability to accurately identify pathological tissue and remove the
tumor while preserving surrounding healthy structures. However, building an
intraoperative 3D tumor model for subsequent removal faces major challenges due
to the lack of high-fidelity tumor reconstruction, difficulties in developing
generalized tissue models to handle the inherent complexities of tumor
diagnosis, and the natural physical limitations of bimanual operation,
physiologic tremor, and fatigue creep during surgery. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce "TumorMap", a surgical robotic platform to formulate
intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and achieve autonomous tissue resection
using a set of multifunctional lasers. TumorMap integrates a three-laser
mechanism (optical coherence tomography, laser-induced endogenous fluorescence,
and cutting laser scalpel) combined with deep learning models to achieve
fully-automated and noncontact tumor resection. We validated TumorMap in murine
osteoscarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma tumor models, and established a novel
histopathological workflow to estimate sensor performance. With submillimeter
laser resection accuracy, we demonstrated multimodal sensor-guided autonomous
tumor surgery without any human intervention.

Conclusion: ViTaMIn-B offers a more capable, efficient handheld data collection solution for bimanual, contact-rich manipulation, with improved tactile sensing, robust pose tracking, and better cross-sensor generalization, accelerating data collection and performance in related tasks.

Abstract: Handheld devices have opened up unprecedented opportunities to collect large-scale, high-quality demonstrations efficiently. However, existing systems often lack robust tactile sensing or reliable pose tracking to handle complex interaction scenarios, especially for bimanual and contact-rich tasks. In this work, we propose ViTaMIn-B, a more capable and efficient handheld data collection system for such tasks. We first design DuoTact, a novel compliant visuo-tactile sensor built with a flexible frame to withstand large contact forces during manipulation while capturing high-resolution contact geometry. To enhance the cross-sensor generalizability, we propose reconstructing the sensor's global deformation as a 3D point cloud and using it as the policy input. We further develop a robust, unified 6-DoF bimanual pose acquisition process using Meta Quest controllers, which eliminates the trajectory drift issue in common SLAM-based methods. Comprehensive user studies confirm the efficiency and high usability of ViTaMIn-B among novice and expert operators. Furthermore, experiments on four bimanual manipulation tasks demonstrate its superior task performance relative to existing systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified, manufacturable framework for soft sleeve actuation that supports compact, user-centric wearable assistive devices with enhanced kinematic/kinetic performance and simplified attachment requirements.

Abstract: Aging populations and the rising prevalence of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders increase the demand for wearable mobility assistive devices that are effective, comfortable, and anatomically compatible. Many existing systems use rigid mechanisms and bulky interfaces that impede force transmission and reduce wearability. This study introduces a soft sleeve actuation architecture that conforms to the limb while transmitting forces and moments efficiently.

Motivation: Outdoor aerial VLN faces data acquisition challenges and long-horizon planning needs; there is a need for data-efficient VLM adaptation for UAV navigation in complex environments.

Method: Reconfigure reinforcement learning to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation using rule-based policies under limited data; introduce a long-horizon trajectory planner that generates UAV actions via value-based rewards; evaluate on TravelUAV with varying reward settings.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements over baselines: up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in SPL; demonstrates efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.

Conclusion: The proposed OpenVLN framework provides data-efficient, scalable capabilities for language-guided UAV navigation and long-horizon planning in challenging outdoor aerial environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely-applied in ground-based vision-language navigation (VLN). However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A memory-efficient, retrieval-based fine-tuning framework (ExpReS-VLA) for pre-trained Vision-Language-Action models that uses compact frozen-backbone embeddings and prioritized experience replay to achieve fast, stable adaptation with strong task-specific performance in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world robotic deployment, broad zero-shot generalization isn't enough; there is a premium on consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enabling practical adaptation time and compute.

Method: Store compact features from a frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs; during deployment, retrieve relevant past experiences via cosine similarity; use prioritized experience replay to emphasize successful trajectories; introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss to learn from both successes and failures; adaptation is fast (about 31 seconds) with 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090.

Result: In LIBERO sim, spatial reasoning success rises from 82.6% to 93.1%; long-horizon tasks rise from 61% to 72.3%. Physical robot experiments reach 98% success on both seen and unseen tasks, versus 84.7% and 32% for naive fine-tuning. Memory usage is reduced by ~97% by storing compact features instead of raw image-action pairs.

Conclusion: ExpReS-VLA enables practical specialization of pre-trained VLA models for robotics: fast adaptation with substantial memory savings, mitigated forgetting, and improved task-specific performance on both simulated and real-world benchmarks, suitable for deployment with modest compute resources.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models such as OpenVLA show impressive zero-shot generalization across robotic manipulation tasks but often fail to adapt efficiently to new deployment environments. In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Zero-shot affordance-guided base placement in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation that fuses vision-language model semantics with geometric feasibility in a coarse-to-fine loop, achieving 85% success across five tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation requires base placements that support manipulation; proximity-based, non-affordance-aware choices lead to frequent failures. There is a need for task-relevant, semantic-aware reasoning that goes beyond egocentric RGB perception to improve planning robustness.

Method: Construct cross-modal representations (Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+) by leveraging vision-language models to provide coarse semantic priors. Use an iterative coarse-to-fine optimization that guides base placement toward task-relevant regions and refines with geometric constraints, reducing convergence to local optima and aligning semantics with spatial feasibility.

Result: Achieves an 85% success rate across five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Affordance-aware multimodal reasoning enhances generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM, showing the promise of integrating vision-language priors with geometric feasibility for robust base placement.

Abstract: In open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM), task success often hinges on the selection of an appropriate base placement for the robot. Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods. This demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need differentiable collision detection to enable gradient-based optimization in manipulation tasks. Traditional GJK+EPA is non-differentiable and convex-only smoothing methods fail on complex geometries; robust differentiability across diverse scales is required.

Method: Proposes distance-based first-order randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport to produce robust, informative gradients for witness points across both convex and concave meshes, enabling differentiable collision signals suitable for gradient-based optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluation on complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse shows significant improvements over existing baselines; demonstrates a direct application to dexterous grasp synthesis to refine grasp quality; code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust and scalable differentiable collision detection for both convex and concave geometries, unlocking gradient-based optimization in contact-rich manipulation tasks and broadening applicability beyond convex-only assumptions.

Abstract: Collision detection is a core component of robotics applications such as simulation, control, and planning. Traditional algorithms like GJK+EPA compute witness points (i.e., the closest or deepest-penetration pairs between two objects) but are inherently non-differentiable, preventing gradient flow and limiting gradient-based optimization in contact-rich tasks such as grasping and manipulation. Recent work introduced efficient first-order randomized smoothing to make witness points differentiable; however, their direction-based formulation is restricted to convex objects and lacks robustness for complex geometries. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient differentiable collision detection framework that supports both convex and concave objects across diverse scales and configurations. Our method introduces distance-based first-order randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport for robust and informative gradient computation. Experiments on complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse show significant improvements over existing baselines. Finally, we demonstrate a direct application of our method for dexterous grasp synthesis to refine the grasp quality. The code is available at https://github.com/JYChen18/DiffCollision.

*Seiichi Yamamoto,Hiroki Ishizuka,Takumi Kawasetsu,Koh Hosoda,Takayuki Kameoka,Kango Yanagida,Takato Horii,Sei Ikeda,Osamu Oshiro*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular, externally mounted optical tactile sensor uses soft-skin surface deformation to infer contact force, avoiding embedded transducers; demonstrated on a soft gripper with durable, easy-to-fabricate deployment and potential for broader somatosensory cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots require tactile feedback for manipulation and safety, but embedding sensors can compromise softness, durability, and fabrication simplicity. An off-interface, compliant-skin based approach could provide robust force sensing with easier maintenance and broader geometry compatibility.

Method: Characterize the optical sensing element and compliant silicone skin; design a prototype tactile sensor as an external add-on; perform compression experiments to assess monotonicity, hysteresis, repeatability, and response speed; integrate the module on a soft robotic gripper to detect grasp events; compare against liquid-filled or wire-embedded skins and discuss extensions to other cues.

Result: The sensor shows a monotonic force-output relationship aligned with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over cycles, and small response times. It detects grasp events reliably when integrated on a soft gripper. The modular external design improves durability, reduces wiring complexity, and enables deployment across diverse geometries.

Conclusion: Reading skin strain via an external optical module enables practical, robust force perception for soft robots while preserving flexibility and manufacturability, with potential extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation, supporting safer human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: We present a tactile sensing method enabled by the mechanical compliance of soft robots; an externally attachable photoreflective module reads surface deformation of silicone skin to estimate contact force without embedding tactile transducers. Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation. Overall, leveraging surface compliance with an external optical module provides a practical and robust route to equip soft robots with force perception while preserving structural flexibility and manufacturability, paving the way for robotic applications and safe human robot collaboration.

*Yingnan Zhao,Xinmiao Wang,Dewei Wang,Xinzhe Liu,Dan Lu,Qilong Han,Peng Liu,Chenjia Bai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) learns a single, adaptable locomotion controller by distilling multiple skill policies into a base controller and then online-reinforcement fine-tuning across diverse terrains, showing robust cross-skill and cross-terrain performance on Unitree G1 robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid locomotion research often trains separate policies per skill, leading to poor generalization and brittleness on irregular terrains. A unified, adaptable controller could switch and adjust across multiple skills and terrains.

Method: Stage 1: train several primary locomotion policies and perform multi-behavior distillation to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller enabling environment-based behavior switching. Stage 2: reinforced fine-tuning via online feedback as the robot performs adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains to improve terrain adaptability. Evaluations conducted in simulation and real-world Unitree G1 robots; project website provided.

Result: The approach yields strong adaptability across varied situations and terrains, validated by experiments in both simulation and real hardware (Unitree G1).

Conclusion: AHC offers an effective framework for cross-skill, cross-terrain humanoid locomotion, improving robustness and deployment potential in real-world, diverse environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to learn a diverse set of human-like locomotion behaviors, including standing up, walking, running, and jumping. However, existing methods predominantly require training independent policies for each skill, yielding behavior-specific controllers that exhibit limited generalization and brittle performance when deployed on irregular terrains and in diverse situations. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) that adopts a two-stage framework to learn an adaptive humanoid locomotion controller across different skills and terrains. Specifically, we first train several primary locomotion policies and perform a multi-behavior distillation process to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller, facilitating adaptive behavior switching based on the environment. Then, we perform reinforced fine-tuning by collecting online feedback in performing adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains, enhancing terrain adaptability for the controller. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world experiments in Unitree G1 robots. The results show that our method exhibits strong adaptability across various situations and terrains.

*Prajval Kumar Murali,Mohsen Kaboli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A visuo-tactile, articulated object tracking method (ArtReg) uses an unscented Kalman Filter on SE(3) to register point clouds, detect joints, and enable closed-loop, goal-driven manipulation of unseen articulated objects without prior geometry or kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating in real-world environments must perceive, track, and manipulate unknown articulated objects (doors, drawers, tools) without prior knowledge of geometry or kinematics, in cluttered and variable lighting and backgrounds.

Method: Introduce ArtReg, a visuo-tactile-based tracking approach that fuses visual and tactile point clouds within an unscented Kalman Filter on SE(3) for robust point-cloud registration. Use purposeful manipulation maneuvers (e.g., pushing, hold-pulling with two robots) to reveal articulated joints. Extend ArtReg into a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation to reach desired pose configurations.

Result: Extensive real-robot experiments across various unknown objects; robustness to changes in center of mass, low-light conditions, and challenging visual backgrounds. Benchmark on a standard dataset showing improved pose accuracy over state-of-the-art methods for both single and articulated objects with revolute or prismatic joints.

Conclusion: Visuo-tactile information enables robust perception and interaction with unseen articulated objects, enabling accurate pose tracking and manipulation without prior object models.

Abstract: Robots operating in real-world environments frequently encounter unknown objects with complex structures and articulated components, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, and tools. The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).

*Ralf Römer,Julian Balletshofer,Jakob Thumm,Marco Pavone,Angela P. Schoellig,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PACS provides a safety-filter for diffusion policies that preserves task performance while guaranteeing safety via path-consistent braking and set-based reachability, outperforming reactive methods in dynamic HU tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies achieve high performance but lack formal safety guarantees; external safety filters can break training distribution and degrade performance; a safe, real-time approach that preserves learned behavior is needed.

Method: Introduce path-consistent safety filtering (PACS): compute a trajectory from a sequence of generated actions, perform braking along that path to enforce safety, and verify safety with set-based reachability in real time to stay within the policy’s training distribution.

Result: In both simulation and three real-world human-robot interaction tasks, PACS yields formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, preserves task success rates, and surpasses reactive safety methods (e.g., control barrier functions) by up to 68% in task success.

Conclusion: PACS provides a practical, provably safe augmentation for diffusion policies that maintains performance while offering strong safety guarantees in dynamic settings; it outperforms existing reactive safety approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion policies (DPs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex manipulation tasks by learning from large-scale demonstration datasets, often spanning multiple embodiments and environments. However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

*Cong Wen,Yunfei Li,Kexin Liu,Yixin Qiu,Xuanhong Liao,Tianyu Wang,Dingchuan Liu,Tao Zhang,Ximin Lyu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 6-DoF wheeled biped robot with a full closed-loop dynamics model and terrain-aware whole-body control is proposed to overcome leg-dynamics simplifications and improve traversal on uneven terrain, validated via simulation and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of simplifying leg dynamics in wheeled bipeds and the challenge of traversing uneven terrain by developing an integrated dynamics model and terrain-aware control framework.

Method: Develop a complete closed-loop dynamics model for a 6-DoF wheeled biped, with a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal; estimate terrain using LiDAR-IMU odometry and improved PCA; apply PD control for pose and LQR for centroidal balance; solve the whole-body control problem via hierarchical optimization.

Result: Terrain estimation algorithm is validated; the approach demonstrates robustness and the ability to traverse uneven terrain in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The integration of full dynamics, terrain estimation, and hierarchical control enhances motion potential and terrain adaptability for wheeled bipeds.

Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots have garnered increasing attention in exploration and inspection. However, most research simplifies calculations by ignoring leg dynamics, thereby restricting the robot's full motion potential. Additionally, robots face challenges when traversing uneven terrain. To address the aforementioned issue, we develop a complete dynamics model and design a whole-body control framework with terrain estimation for a novel 6 degrees of freedom wheeled bipedal robot. This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is used to solve the whole-body control problem. We validate the performance of the terrain estimation algorithm and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and ability to traverse uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.

*Lingfan Bao,Tianhu Peng,Chengxu Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A conceptual chapter diagnosing the sim-to-real gap in DRL-based bipedal locomotion and proposing a two-pronged framework—enhancing simulator fidelity (model-centric) and hardening policies through robustness training and adaptation—with a roadmap for robust transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable DRL-driven bipedal locomotion in real-world deployment by addressing the key sources of sim-to-real discrepancy.

Method: Diagnostic analysis of the sim-to-real gap sources (robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, numerical solvers); taxonomy of mitigation approaches; synthesis into a two-branch framework (model-centric fidelity vs policy hardening) and a strategic roadmap for development and evaluation.

Result: Proposes a strategic framework and roadmap, with a clear taxonomy of gap sources and complementary solution philosophies to guide robust sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: A combined approach—improving simulator fidelity and hardening policies through robustness training and adaptation—is essential for robust sim-to-real transfer in DRL-driven bipedal locomotion, and the chapter provides a concrete framework for future work and evaluation.

Abstract: This chapter addresses the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in bipedal locomotion. After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies. The chapter concludes by synthesizing these philosophies into a strategic framework, providing a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions.

### [393] [A Low-Rank Method for Vision Language Model Hallucination Mitigation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06496)
*Keke Long,Jiacheng Guo,Tianyun Zhang,Hongkai Yu,Xiaopeng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-contained, low-rank method to rank candidate VLM captions by hallucination level using only captions, achieving 87% accuracy on NuScenes and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving are dangerous and difficult to detect without ground-truth references or access to model internals; a reference-free, model-agnostic method is needed.

Method: Create a sentence-embedding matrix from competing captions, decompose it into a low-rank (consensus) component and a sparse residual; rank captions by residual magnitude, selecting the caption with the smallest residual as the least hallucination.

Result: On NuScenes, the method achieves 87% accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, a 19% improvement over baseline unfiltered selection and 6–10% improvement over the multi-agent debate approach. The residual-based scores correlate well with human judgments and the method reduces inference time by 51–67% due to easy parallelization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for identifying hallucination-free captions in real-time autonomous driving settings without requiring external references or internal model access.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous driving to help understand traffic scenes, but they sometimes produce hallucinations, which are false details not grounded in the visual input. Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications.

### [394] [Adaptive PID Control for Robotic Systems via Hierarchical Meta-Learning and Reinforcement Learning with Physics-Based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06500)
*JiaHao Wu,ShengWen Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical control framework fuses meta-learning for initializing PID gains with reinforcement learning for online adaptation, aided by physics-based data augmentation to boost sample efficiency. Evaluated on two heterogeneous robots, it yields substantial improvements on Franka Panda and reveals an 'optimization ceiling' where RL helps only when the meta-learning baseline has localized high errors, with robustness across disturbances and strong seed stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PID controllers are widely used in industry due to simplicity, but tuning is time-consuming across diverse robots. There is a need for sample-efficient, adaptive schemes that can generalize across platforms while keeping training time short.

Method: Propose a hierarchical control system: meta-learning to initialize PID parameters, RL for online adaptation; physics-based data augmentation generates virtual configurations by perturbing physical parameters to improve meta-learning with limited real data; evaluate on 9-DOF Franka Panda and 12-DOF Laikago quadruped; training time ~10 minutes; multi-seed analysis with 100 random initializations.

Result: Average MAE improvement of 16.6% on Franka Panda (6.26° MAE); J2 joint gains up to 80.4% (12.36° to 2.42°). RL exhibits an optimization ceiling: substantial gains when meta-learning baseline has localized high errors, but no gains when baseline is uniformly strong (Laikago). Robust to disturbances: parameter uncertainty +19.2%, no disturbance +16.6%, average +10.0%; evidence from 10 minutes of training. Across 100 seeds, stability: 4.81±1.64% average.

Conclusion: RL effectiveness is strongly conditioned by the quality of the meta-learning baseline and the error distribution across joints; design guidance for hierarchical controllers is to tailor the meta-learning initialization so that RL has meaningful, localized high-error targets to improve, while recognizing that in uniformly strong baselines RL may offer little benefit. The approach demonstrates data-efficient, robust control across heterogeneous platforms.

Abstract: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers remain the predominant choice in industrial robotics due to their simplicity and reliability. However, manual tuning of PID parameters for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel hierarchical control framework that combines meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning (RL) for online adaptation. To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26° MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\% improvement from 12.36° to 2.42°). Critically, this work discovers the \textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\%, no disturbance: +16.6\%, average: +10.0\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\% average). These results establish that RL effectiveness is highly dependent on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.

*Cormac O'Neill,Jasmine Terrones,H. Harry Asada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Koopman-operator-based approach to unify contact-rich dynamics into a globally linear embedding, enabling convex MPC for legged robots and real-time manipulation control in dynamic contact tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich systems cause switching dynamics that render traditional predictive controllers non-convex; a linearized model in an embedding space could enable tractable planning.

Method: Learn a Koopman embedding that subsumes segmented contact dynamics into a single linear model; leverage viscoelastic contact properties; apply convex MPC for legged locomotion; apply real-time control for dynamic pushing; claims no approximation to inputs.

Result: Demonstrates convex MPC-enabled legged robot control and real-time manipulator control across multiple contact changes; shows the method enables discovering complex strategies in real-time; claims broad applicability beyond robotics.

Conclusion: Koopman-based embedding offers a unified, globally-linear framework for contact dynamics, enabling tractable control and potential broad impact; further work needed on robustness, data requirements, and scalability.

Abstract: Controlling robots that dynamically engage in contact with their environment is a pressing challenge. Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.

### [396] [CoFineLLM: Conformal Finetuning of LLMs for Language-Instructed Robot Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06575)
*Jun Wang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoFineLLM: a conformal-prediction-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that reduces conformal prediction set size, lowering human interventions while preserving CP guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs used as planners can output overconfident yet incorrect actions. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with user-defined confidence, but standard LLM training is uncertainty-agnostic, causing unnecessarily large sets and frequent interventions. There is a need to align LLM training with CP objectives to enable more autonomous planning.

Method: Introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), a CP-aware finetuning framework that explicitly minimizes prediction-set size and human interventions for LLM-based planners. Evaluate on language-instructed robot planning tasks, comparing against uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic baselines, and test robustness to out-of-distribution conditions in hardware experiments.

Result: Across multiple language-instructed robot planning problems, CoFineLLM consistently reduces prediction-set size and help rates compared to both uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic baselines. Demonstrates robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

Conclusion: CP-aware finetuning improves autonomy and reliability of LLM-based planners under conformal guarantees, enabling more autonomous deployment by shrinking prediction sets and reducing human interventions; the approach generalizes across tasks and shows OOD robustness in hardware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as planners for language-instructed agents, generating sequences of actions to accomplish natural language tasks. However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diagnostic benchmark GrinningFace evaluates how vision-language-action models inherit vision-language priors from large VLMs for embodied control using an emoji tabletop task; results show preserving VLM priors is crucial for generalization and guide future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLA systems transfer priors from VLMs to embodied robotics and to establish a clean, scalable diagnostic that reveals where priors are preserved or lost during transfer.

Method: Introduce GrinningFace, an emoji-based tabletop manipulation task implemented in both simulation and on a real robot. Systematically compare knowledge-transfer techniques including parameter-efficient fine-tuning, freezing VLMs, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions to assess how well VLM priors are preserved.

Result: Systematic evaluation demonstrates that preserving VLM priors is critical for the generalization of VLA. The study provides empirical guidance and establishes guidelines for future research in generalizable embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: GrinningFace serves as a useful diagnostic for evaluating the transfer of VLM priors to embodied control and helps chart pathways for developing truly generalizable VLA systems.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.

TL;DR: Implicit time-stepping in a general-purpose soft-body simulator (DisMech) enables rapid policy learning for soft robots, delivering large speedups (up to 6x non-contact, 40x contact-rich) with maintained accuracy and enabling effective sim-to-sim transfer; delta natural curvature control provides intuitive actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robotics suffer from scarce, expensive simulation frameworks and high computational costs that hinder policy learning; a fast, general-purpose, accurate simulator and intuitive control interface are needed.

Method: Use DisMech, a fully implicit soft-body simulator handling soft dynamics and frictional contact; introduce delta natural curvature control; compare against Elastica across four tasks; run parallel 500-environment experiments; perform sim-to-sim evaluation.

Result: Up to 6x speedup for non-contact, up to 40x for contact-rich scenarios; sim-to-sim gap reduced; accuracy preserved; delta curvature control is effective and intuitive.

Conclusion: Implicit time-stepping unlocks dramatic speedups for soft robot policy learning without sacrificing accuracy; the proposed delta curvature control and comparison framework establish a practical path toward rapid learning in soft robotics.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: A parametrised class of soft actuators (PTSPAs) with a geometry generator and semi-automated parameter exploration maps design choices to performance, demonstrated by deployable soft quadruped legs that adapt to confined spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the curse of dimensionality in soft robotics by introducing tractable, modular, parameterisable designs that can harness the free-form behavior of soft structures for deployable and morphing applications.

Method: Develop a parametric geometry generator to customize actuator models from high-level inputs, perform semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters, and characterize extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness.

Result: Identified clear relationships between design parameters and performance; demonstrated actuators' capabilities in extension, bending, expansion, stiffness control, and deployed them in a soft quadruped that adapts to confined spaces.

Conclusion: PTSPAs establish a new design paradigm for deployable and shape-morphing soft structures, enabling large length changes and broad applicability in constrained environments.

Abstract: Soft Robotics presents a rich canvas for free-form and continuum devices capable of exerting forces in any direction and transforming between arbitrary configurations. However, there is no current way to tractably and directly exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design parameters and performance. Finally we demonstrate the application of the actuators in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling automatic adaptation to confined spaces. PTSPAs present new design paradigm for deployable and shape morphing structures and wherever large length changes are required.

*Lan Thi Ha Nguyen,Kien Ton Manh,Anh Do Duc,Nam Pham Hai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PI-RIG introduces a physics-informed p3-VAE to generate physically consistent goals for self-supervised goal-conditioned RL, speeding learning and improving skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal setting in self-supervised RL is hard: actors must propose goals that are feasible and diverse in their current environment. Prior methods (e.g., RIG) rely on a learned latent space via VAE that can produce physically implausible goals, hindering learning efficiency.

Method: Develop Enhanced Physics-Informed p3-VAE that explicitly separates latent space into physics variables (governing object dynamics) and appearance factors, and enforce physical consistency via differential equation constraints and conservation laws. Integrate these physics constraints into VAE training to generate physically feasible and achievable goals respecting principles like object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that physics-informed goal generation yields higher quality goals, improved exploration, and faster skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks such as reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical constraints into goal generation for self-supervised goal-conditioned RL leads to more effective learning by ensuring proposed goals are physically consistent and achievable, with broad applicability to manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning enables robots to autonomously acquire diverse skills without human supervision. However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.

### [402] [Semi-distributed Cross-modal Air-Ground Relative Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06749)
*Weining Lu,Deer Bin,Lian Ma,Ming Ma,Zhihao Ma,Xiangyang Chen,Longfei Wang,Yixiao Feng,Zhouxian Jiang,Yongliang Shi,Bin Liang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A semi-distributed cross-modal relative localization framework for air-ground collaboration that decouples localization from global SLAM by running SLAM independently on UGV and UAV, using UGV-fused LiDAR/camera/IMU BA and deep-learned features with low-bandwidth communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot SLAM relies on tightly coupled state estimation across all agents, limiting flexibility and accuracy especially in cross-modal air-ground tasks. A decoupled, cross-modal approach can leverage rich UGV sensors and DL-based keypoints to improve efficiency and robustness.

Method: Both UGV and UAV run SLAM separately and extract deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors. The UGV performs local Bundle Adjustment using LiDAR, camera, and IMU, in two stages: (1) optimize camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, and (2) estimate relative camera poses between UGV and UAV. An incremental loop-closure detection uses DL descriptors to maintain/retrieve keyframes. Unlike transmitting full images/point clouds, only keypoint pixels and descriptors are sent, keeping bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Result: The approach achieves high accuracy and efficiency in experiments, with substantial bandwidth savings and publicly available code/data.

Conclusion: A flexible, cross-modal, semi-distributed localization framework that decouples relative localization from full multi-robot SLAM, enabling robust air-ground collaboration with low communication requirements.

Abstract: Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps. Codes and data will be publicly available on https://github.com/Ascbpiac/cross-model-relative-localization.git.

TL;DR: LIBERO+ introduces a dataset and SlotVLA framework for object-centric and relation-aware robotic manipulation, enabling compact, interpretable visuomotor control with reduced visual tokens and scalable generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiency and opacity of dense embeddings by focusing on object-level representations and relations for robust, explainable manipulation.

Method: LIBERO+ provides rich object-centric annotations (boxes, masks, instance tracking). SlotVLA uses slot-attention visual tokenizer for temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to form task embeddings, and an LLM-driven module to convert embeddings into actions.

Result: Object-centric slots and relation-aware slots drastically reduce required visual tokens while achieving competitive generalization on LIBERO+ tasks.

Conclusion: The combination of LIBERO+ and SlotVLA offers a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.

### [404] [Human-Level Actuation for Humanoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06796)
*MD-Nazmus Sunbeam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework to quantify human-level actuation in humanoids using a DoF atlas, Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE), and a Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS), with reproducible protocols and a worked example to benchmark actuation across systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peak torque or speed figures fail to capture task-relevant performance and endurance; there is a need for standardized, biomechanics-grounded metrics to benchmark and compare actuation across robots.

Method: Three components: (1) a kinematic DoF atlas that standardizes joint frames via ISB conventions; (2) Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE) that assess whether a robot meets human torque and power at the same joint angle and rate, weighted by positive work in task-specific bands; (3) Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS) aggregating workspace coverage, HEE coverage, torque-bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability; measurement protocols include dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing; a worked example demonstrates trade-offs.

Result: The framework yields a scalar, reproducible HLAS that reveals actuator trade-offs (e.g., gearing versus bandwidth and efficiency) hidden by peak-torque specs; provides a design guide and benchmarking standard grounded in human biomechanics data; accompanied by detailed protocols and a multi-joint humanoid example.

Conclusion: The framework offers a comprehensive, biomechanics-grounded standard for designing and benchmarking humanoid actuation, enabling task-relevant, cross-system comparisons and exposing trade-offs that traditional specs overlook.

Abstract: Claims that humanoid robots achieve ``human-level'' actuation are common but rarely quantified. Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,ω)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications obscure. The framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, with all components grounded in published human biomechanics data.

### [405] [Vision-Aided Online A* Path Planning for Efficient and Safe Navigation of Service Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06801)
*Praveen Kumar,Tushar Sandhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that merges lightweight semantic perception with an online A* planner to enable context-aware navigation on affordable robots, by projecting user-defined semantic constraints as non-geometric obstacles on a continually updated map; validated in simulation and on a real platform with real-time, robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between semantic understanding and geometric planning for autonomous navigation. Traditional LiDAR-based systems are geometrically precise but semantically blind, making them unable to distinguish critical objects from benign ones; there is a need for real-time, cost-efficient semantics-enabled planning on embedded hardware.

Method: A lightweight perception module uses semantic segmentation to identify user-defined visual constraints. These are fused with geometric data and projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map, which is continuously updated from sensors. An online A* planner uses this context-aware map to navigate with task-driven constraints. The framework supports operator-defined critical objects (e.g., sensitive documents, safety lines) for adaptable fulfillment of task requirements on a low-cost platform.

Result: Demonstrates robust, real-time performance in both high-fidelity simulations and a real robotic platform, enabling safe navigation in complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.

Conclusion: Context-aware navigation driven by semantic cues is feasible on affordable robots. Integrating semantic perception with planning yields safer, task-guided navigation and can extend to various domains by defining critical visual constraints.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous service robots in human-centric environments is hindered by a critical gap in perception and planning. Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-agent, multimodal LLM-based framework for road-situation monitoring achieves perfect recall and schema correctness on a small custom dataset, but shows false positives and latency issues; Gemini-2.0-Flash outperforms Gemini-2.5-Flash in several aspects, highlighting the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional road-situation detection struggles with unseen scenarios and lacks semantic interpretability for reliable traffic recommendations; a hybrid MLLM-vision approach aims to provide robust perception, reasoning, and actionable messages for C-ITS.

Method: A distributed multi-agent system processing camera feeds, with dedicated agents for situation detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and C-ITS message generation; uses multimodal LLMs (Gemini-2.0-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Flash) to integrate vision and language for interpretation and planning; evaluated on 103 images from 20 videos of the TAD dataset.

Result: 100% recall in situation detection; perfect message schema correctness; but false positives and reduced accuracy in lanes, lane status, and cause code; Gemini-2.5-Flash shows higher latency and lower detection accuracy/semantic understanding than Gemini-2.0-Flash despite being more capable generally.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs/MLLMs for intelligent transportation is warranted; performance gaps suggest targeted adaptation to perception, semantics, and ITS message schemas.

Abstract: Conventional road-situation detection methods achieve strong performance in predefined scenarios but fail in unseen cases and lack semantic interpretation, which is crucial for reliable traffic recommendations. This work introduces a multi-agent AI framework that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vision-based perception for road-situation monitoring. The framework processes camera feeds and coordinates dedicated agents for situation detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) message generation. Evaluation is conducted on a custom dataset of 103 images extracted from 20 videos of the TAD dataset. Both Gemini-2.0-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Flash were evaluated. The results show 100\% recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness; however, both models suffer from false-positive detections and have reduced performance in terms of number of lanes, driving lane status and cause code. Surprisingly, Gemini-2.5-Flash, though more capable in general tasks, underperforms Gemini-2.0-Flash in detection accuracy and semantic understanding and incurs higher latency (Table II). These findings motivate further work on fine-tuning specialized LLMs or MLLMs tailored for intelligent transportation applications.

TL;DR: Vision SLAM fused with vehicle dynamics improves gyroscope calibration and ego-motion localization in consumer-grade cars, outperforming prior methods on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioceptive sensors alone accumulate drift and require calibration; visual SLAM offers global references but integration in automotive ego-motion is underexplored; aim to enhance localization accuracy for consumer vehicles.

Method: A fusion framework integrating visual SLAM with a lateral dynamics model to enable online gyroscope calibration during real driving; leveraging vision to constrain IMU/odometry estimation and improve ego-motion estimates.

Result: The approach yields improved gyroscope calibration accuracy and localization performance on both proprietary and public datasets, with superior results on a public benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Visual SLAM integration is a promising direction for higher-precision automotive localization, enabling online calibration and better robustness in real-world driving.

Abstract: Accurate ego-motion estimation in consumer-grade vehicles currently relies on proprioceptive sensors, i.e. wheel odometry and IMUs, whose performance is limited by systematic errors and calibration. While visual-inertial SLAM has become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy. We provide results on both proprietary and public datasets, showing improved performance and superior localization accuracy on a public benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a low-cost, reproducible hardware/software stack can achieve research-grade underwater positioning and provides a unified reference platform for laboratories and swarm robotics research.

Abstract: Precise underwater positioning remains a fundamental challenge for underwater robotics since global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals cannot penetrate the sea surface. This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth sensing on transparent and reflective surfaces is notoriously unreliable with conventional sensors, hindering perception and grasping; a robust depth completion approach is needed to enhance manipulation performance.

Method: A dual-branch Transformer-CNN encoder extracts modality-specific features; a lightweight multimodal fusion module combines low-level features; a Transformer-Mamba fusion module at the bottleneck fuses high-level semantic/global context; trained for depth completion and evaluated on public datasets; then validated with robotic grasping experiments.

Result: The proposed HDCNet attains state-of-the-art depth completion accuracy on multiple public datasets and substantially improves robotic grasping for transparent/reflective objects, with grasp success increases up to 60%.

Conclusion: Integrating modality-specific Transformer and CNN features with Transformer-Mamba fusion yields robust depth completion and significantly enhances manipulation performance on challenging surfaces.

Abstract: Depth perception of transparent and reflective objects has long been a critical challenge in robotic manipulation.Conventional depth sensors often fail to provide reliable measurements on such surfaces, limiting the performance of robots in perception and grasping tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel depth completion network,HDCNet,which integrates the complementary strengths of Transformer,CNN and Mamba architectures.Specifically,the encoder is designed as a dual-branch Transformer-CNN framework to extract modality-specific features. At the shallow layers of the encoder, we introduce a lightweight multimodal fusion module to effectively integrate low-level features. At the network bottleneck,a Transformer-Mamba hybrid fusion module is developed to achieve deep integration of high-level semantic and global contextual information, significantly enhancing depth completion accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that HDCNet achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in depth completion tasks.Furthermore,robotic grasping experiments show that HDCNet substantially improves grasp success rates for transparent and reflective objects,achieving up to a 60% increase.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework decouples motion planning from vehicle control via spatial-temporal alignment between a virtual and real vehicle, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for RL-based motion planning in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sim-to-real gap in robotics/autonomous driving arises from complex, uncertain vehicle dynamics (tire characteristics, road conditions, aerodynamics, load) that are hard to model accurately, hindering direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation.

Method: Train an RL agent in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Distill its behavior into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, use a Stanley controller for lateral dynamics, with adaptive longitudinal alignment to compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories.

Result: Real-vehicle experiments validate the approach, showing robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, effectively decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.

Conclusion: An alignment-based decoupling framework enables robust sim-to-real transfer for RL-based motion planning in autonomous driving, by separating high-level trajectory planning from low-level vehicle control and ensuring consistent virtual-real trajectory alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.

### [412] [Automated Generation of Continuous-Space Roadmaps for Routing Mobile Robot Fleets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07175)
*Marvin Rüdt,Constantin Enke,Kai Furmans*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An automated continuous-space roadmap generator for intralogistics that respects minimum distance constraints and transport demand, using free-space discretization and K-shortest-path optimization with path smoothing; it outperforms grid-based baselines in low complexity, high redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient routing of mobile robot fleets is essential for intralogistics. Grid-based roadmaps sacrifice geometric precision, while continuous-space methods often ignore practical constraints. The work aims to bridge this gap by generating roadmaps in continuous space that honor real-world constraints to improve throughput and robustness.

Method: The approach discretizes free space, integrates station-to-station transport demand, enforces minimum distance constraints on nodes and edges, and uses transport-demand-driven K-shortest-path optimization followed by path smoothing to produce tailored roadmaps.

Result: Experimental evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases shows the proposed roadmaps achieve lower structural complexity and higher redundancy than 4-connected grids, 8-connected grids, and random sampling, with near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous-space roadmap generation method effectively bridges the gap between grid-based and continuous approaches, delivering practical, efficient, and robust roadmaps for intralogistics routing.

Abstract: Efficient routing of mobile robot fleets is crucial in intralogistics, where delays and deadlocks can substantially reduce system throughput. Roadmap design, specifying feasible transport routes, directly affects fleet coordination and computational performance. Existing approaches are either grid-based, compromising geometric precision, or continuous-space approaches that disregard practical constraints. This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.

### [413] [Robotic versus Human Teleoperation for Remote Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07275)
*David Black,Septimiu Salcudean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Human-guided tele-ultrasound performs as well as robotic teleoperation in key metrics, with more consistent force and greater practicality, suggesting suitability for rural settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve access to diagnostic ultrasound in rural areas by evaluating two teleoperation approaches (human-guided vs robotic) and identifying practical and performance differences.

Method: Experimental comparison of human vs robotic teleoperation in ultrasound exams, assessing completion time, position tracking, force consistency, setup time, and flexibility.

Result: No statistically significant differences in completion time (mean ~1.8%), and position accuracy (mean ~0.5%) between the two methods; human teleoperation yielded more consistent force and was more practical/accessible due to lower cost/complexity.

Conclusion: Human teleoperation is a viable and potentially preferable alternative to robotic teleoperation for rural ultrasound deployment, offering comparable performance with greater practicality and accessibility.

Abstract: Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images. Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.

### [414] [PlanT 2.0: Exposing Biases and Structural Flaws in Closed-Loop Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07292)
*Simon Gerstenecker,Andreas Geiger,Katrin Renz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PlanT 2.0 introduces an object-centric planning transformer for autonomous driving in CARLA, enabling controlled perturbations to analyze failures; it achieves state-of-the-art on several benchmarks but reveals issues like limited obstacle diversity, exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting, underscoring a shift toward data-centric development and richer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving research often emphasizes benchmark scores and methodological novelty while neglecting systematic analysis of model failures, biases, and shortcut learning. There is a need for controlled, input-level perturbations to uncover underlying causes of errors and biases.

Method: Develop PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer for autonomous driving in CARLA. Leverage object-level representations to enable perturbations such as adding/removing objects or changing their locations. Evaluate on challenging benchmarks (CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive) and expose failure modes through targeted analysis. Open-source the code and model.

Result: PlanT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and CARLA validation routes. The analysis uncovers failures including limited scene understanding due to low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories.

Conclusion: Advocates a shift toward data-centric development with richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. The authors provide open-source code to facilitate community-driven evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Most recent work in autonomous driving has prioritized benchmark performance and methodological innovation over in-depth analysis of model failures, biases, and shortcut learning. This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. We open-source our code and model at https://github.com/autonomousvision/plant2.

Conclusion: An exact, differentiable STL-based motion planning framework is achievable; the approach yields reliable performance in simulations and paves the way for practical deployment, with potential focus areas in scalability and real-world testing.

Abstract: We study motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a useful formalism for specifying spatial-temporal requirements. We pose STL synthesis as a trajectory optimization problem leveraging the STL robustness semantics.

We validate it in numerical simulations, demonstrating its practical performance.

### [416] [Residual Rotation Correction using Tactile Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07381)
*Yizhe Zhu,Zhang Ye,Boce Hu,Haibo Zhao,Yu Qi,Dian Wang,Robert Platt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EquiTac uses SO(2) symmetry to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning by reconstructing surface normals from tactile sensors and applying an SO(2)-equivariant network to predict rotation residuals that augment a base policy; achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations on a real robot with few samples; claims first tactile method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuotactile policies suffer from high data demands; rotations in-hand correspond to surface normal rotations; leverage symmetry to improve sample efficiency and generalization.

Method: Reconstruct normals from RGB of vision-based tactile sensors; treat rotation of normal field as in-hand rotation; use an SO(2)-equivariant network to predict a residual rotation action; at test time augment base visuomotor policy; real-time rotation correction without extra demonstrations.

Result: Robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples; baselines fail even with more data; validated on a real robot.

Conclusion: First tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning; provides a lightweight symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile policy learning augments vision-only policies with tactile input, facilitating contact-rich manipulation. However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data. To our knowledge, this is the first tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning, yielding a lightweight, symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks.

### [417] [Unified Humanoid Fall-Safety Policy from a Few Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07407)
*Zhengjie Xu,Ye Li,Kwan-yee Lin,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified fall-and-recovery policy for humanoids learned from sparse human demonstrations, reinforcement learning, and a diffusion-based memory of safe reactions; achieves fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery with sim-to-real transfer on a Unitree G1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are an inherent risk in humanoid locomotion. Existing approaches address only parts of the problem (avoidance, controlled descent, or post-fall recovery) and do not provide an integrated, autonomous strategy for preventing, mitigating, and recovering from falls in real environments.

Method: The approach combines sparse human demonstrations to seed safe behaviors, reinforcement learning to adapt and optimize policies, and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions to unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery into a single whole-body policy. The framework supports sim-to-real transfer and is validated on a Unitree G1 across varied disturbances.

Result: Demonstrates robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces during falls, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances in both simulation and on hardware, indicating a safer and more resilient humanoid controller.

Conclusion: This work advances toward safer, more autonomous humanoids by integrating prevention, mitigation, and quick recovery into one policy, highlighting a path to real-world deployment where falls are less Likely and less damaging.

Abstract: Falling is an inherent risk of humanoid mobility. Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

*Hao Wang,Sathwik Karnik,Bea Lim,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMs can function as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotics; this work studies how control horizon and warm-starting affect performance and offers practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unpredictability and costly errors in black-box LLM/VLM planners by analyzing their use in closed-loop symbolic planning from a control-theoretic perspective.

Method: Conduct controlled experiments varying control horizon and warm-start strategies; analyze performance and extract generalizable insights.

Result: Identify how horizon length and warm-starting impact planning performance; provide actionable recommendations to improve VLM-based closed-loop planning systems.

Conclusion: With appropriate horizon settings and warm-starting, VLMs can serve effectively as closed-loop symbolic planners in robotics; the results offer guidelines for designing such planners.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used for embodied symbolic planning. Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.

TL;DR: PhysWorld ties video generation to a physics-based world model to train robots from synthetic visuals, enabling zero-shot, physics-consistent manipulation without real-robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly transferring pixel motions from generated videos to real robots ignores physics, causing manipulation errors; there is a need to align visual demonstrations with physical world dynamics to enable reliable, data-efficient robotic learning.

Method: From a single image and a task command, generate task-conditioned videos and reconstruct the underlying physical world; use object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the world model to ground the video motions into physically executable actions.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show substantially improved manipulation accuracy over prior approaches, demonstrating zero-shot generalization without real robot data.

Conclusion: The approach converts implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating real-robot data collection and enabling zero-shot, physically grounded robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We introduce PhysWorld, a framework that enables robot learning from video generation through physical world modeling. Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLAD-Grasp is a training-free zero-shot robotic grasping method that uses a vision-language model to generate a goal image representing an antipodal grasp from a single RGB-D frame, lifts it into 3D via depth and segmentation, and aligns it with the observed object point cloud through PCA and a correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. It achieves competitive or superior results on Cornell and Jacquard and demonstrates zero-shot real-world generalization on a Franka Research 3 robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on large curated grasp datasets and retraining by leveraging vision-language foundation models as priors for manipulation, enabling zero-shot grasping on novel objects.

Method: From a single RGB-D image, prompt a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod impales the object (antipodal grasp). Predict depth and segmentation to lift this image into 3D. Align the generated and observed object point clouds using principal component analysis and a correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. The approach is training-free and does not require curated grasp datasets.

Result: The method achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. It also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot.

Conclusion: Vision-language foundation models can serve as powerful priors for robotic manipulation, enabling zero-shot grasping without training through a geometry-guided alignment of a generated antipodal-grasp goal with observed scene geometry.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation; however, most existing methods rely on large-scale expert annotations and necessitate retraining to handle new objects. We present VLAD-Grasp, a Vision-Language model Assisted zero-shot approach for Detecting grasps. From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod "impales" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.
