### [1] [DiGS: Accurate and Complete Surface Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians via Direct SDF Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07493)
*Wenzhi Guo,Bing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGS embeds learnable SDFs into 3D Gaussian Splatting to enforce surface priors and enable dense, geometry-guided coverage, improving reconstruction accuracy and completeness while preserving rendering fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS renders with unstructured Gaussian primitives but lacks explicit geometric supervision, leading to incomplete or inconsistent surfaces; imposing strong, interpretable surface priors can improve reconstruction quality.

Method: Introduce a per-Gaussian learnable SDF value aligned with each Gaussian; use this to tie Gaussians to underlying geometry and improve cross-view consistency; implement a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively places Gaussians on geometry-consistent regions within a multi-scale hierarchy; train in a unified framework.

Result: Experiments on DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks& Temples show improved reconstruction accuracy and completeness while maintaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: Embedding SDF learning into 3DGS yields strong, interpretable surface priors and denser, more coherent geometry without sacrificing rendering quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

### [2] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CellPainTR, a transformer-based foundational model for cellular morphology that is robust to batch effects and generalizes to unseen datasets without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional batch correction methods on large-scale JUMP data and maintaining performance on unseen Bray et al. data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch effects and lack of generalizable, scalable models hinder large-scale image-based cellular profiling; a robust, transfer-ready representation is needed to enable cross-study analyses.

Method: A Transformer-based architecture with source-specific context tokens (CellPainTR) designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are robust to batch effects and capable of zero-shot generalization to unseen datasets without fine-tuning; evaluated on the JUMP Cell Painting dataset and tested for out-of-distribution generalization on Bray et al. data; compared against ComBat and Harmony for batch integration and signal preservation.

Result: Outperforms ComBat and Harmony in batch integration and biological signal preservation on the JUMP dataset; demonstrates strong robustness on an unseen Bray et al. dataset with domain and feature shifts, maintaining high performance in an OOD setting.

Conclusion: CellPainTR represents a significant step toward truly foundational, image-based profiling models, enabling more reliable and scalable cross-study biological analysis without the need for retraining on new datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [3] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal fusion of image and audio using YOLOv8n and Vision Transformer improves railway defect detection over image-only models, achieving a small but statistically significant gain on a real dataset for rail rupture and surface defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality image detectors often overdetect or miss defects; audio signals (e.g., mic-recorded rail sounds) can carry complementary cues for structural defects. Integrating audio with image aims to boost precision and robustness in defect detection.

Method: A domain-rule–driven multimodal fusion architecture combining YOLOv8n for object detection with a Vision Transformer (ViT). Feature maps from layers 7, 16, and 19 are fused with synthesized audio representations to detect two defect classes (rail rupture, surface defect). Fusion occurs across modalities; evaluated on a real railway dataset.

Result: Precision and overall accuracy improved by 0.2 percentage points over a vision-only baseline; statistical significance confirmed by Student's unpaired t-test.

Conclusion: Multimodal audio–image fusion with YOLOv8n and ViT effectively enhances railway defect detection, supporting the viability of cross-modal fusion and multi-layer feature integration for real-world industrial inspection.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [4] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClaFR is a post-hoc OOD detector that uses orthogonal decomposition of a classifier’s weights to define a class-known subspace, projects features into this subspace, and uses reconstruction error as the OOD score; it does not require training data and claims strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective OOD detection under data privacy constraints where access to training data is restricted, by providing a training-data-free post-hoc method.

Method: Perform an orthogonal decomposition of the classifier's weights to extract a class-known subspace. Project original data features into this subspace to obtain new representations. Compute the feature reconstruction error within the subspace as the OOD score.

Result: Reported leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks compared to existing post-hoc methods, while not requiring access to training data.

Conclusion: ClaFR offers a simple and effective post-hoc OOD detector suitable for privacy-sensitive settings, achieving competitive accuracy without training data access; code is released.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [5] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP is a lightweight, label-free continued pretraining strategy that adapts foundation models to very small, domain-specific datasets. It requires no extra hyperparameters beyond supervised finetuning, works across modalities and backbones, and yields substantial gains (e.g., DINOv3) with as few as 1000 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains often provide extremely small or imbalanced datasets, making SSL hyperparameter search infeasible and limiting the effectiveness of large-scale pretraining techniques. Pretrained models are usually released as backbone weights without the information needed to continue pretraining, creating a gap between available models and target domains.

Method: A simple continued pretraining objective (DIET-CP) that steers a strong foundation model toward the target data distribution. It is label-free, requires no more hyperparameters than supervised fine-tuning, and is robust across data modalities and backbone choices.

Result: The approach yields significant performance boosts for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using only 1000 images.

Conclusion: DIET-CP provides a stable, low-resource, label-free pathway for domain adaptation of foundation models, extending the utility of backbone-weight releases to new data distributions with minimal hyperparameter overhead.

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [6] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT improves adversarial robustness in Federated Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models by introducing a class-aware prompt generator guided by a Global Label Embedding and cross-layer prompt sharing, addressing non-IID class-information gaps and achieving strong robustness and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-IID data creates a class information gap between clients and the global model, hindering adversarial training in Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT); there is a need to align label information across clients to bolster robustness against adversarial attacks.

Method: Propose a class-aware prompt generator that creates visual prompts from text prompts, guided by a Global Label Embedding acting as a beacon to encode cross-client label information. Introduce a cross-layer generator sharing strategy to couple prompts across model layers. Train under federated settings with adversarial objectives and evaluate on image classification tasks.

Result: Empirically, FedAPT yields superior adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large margin, and demonstrates strong cross-domain and cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: FedAPT effectively mitigates the class information gap in non-IID federated FPT, enhancing robustness and generalization for Vision-Language Models, with strong potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

geospatial models to embed SSL4EO-S12 hyperspectral geospatial data cubes into
embedding vectors that faciliatetes various downstream tasks, e.g.,
classification, regression, etc. In this technical report, we introduce our
proposed method for the Top-1 winning solution on the Embed2Scale Challenge.

### [8] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD introduces an enterprise-focused evaluation framework for Vision-Language Models, featuring a ten-task benchmark, a novel OCR-output comparison algorithm (BlockWeaver), and a 7,500-sample real-world dataset to enable industry-grounded, task-driven VLM assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic VLM benchmarks rely on synthetic data and multiple-choice formats, which fail to capture real-world enterprise needs. There is a gap between research evals and deployment requirements in areas like social media analysis, compliance, and content moderation.

Method: Propose ViLD framework with ten business-critical tasks (logo detection, OCR, object detection, human presence and demographics, activity and appearance, scene detection, camera perspective, media quality, dominant colors, comprehensive description, NSFW). Introduce BlockWeaver for fast, embedding- and LLM-free comparison of unordered OCR outputs. Build a 7,500-sample benchmark from 1,000,000 real-world images/videos. Use semantic matching (embedding-based and LLM-as-judge), traditional metrics, and novel measures of completeness and faithfulness to evaluate VLMs. Benchmark open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, InternVL) against a strong proprietary baseline under ViLD.

Result: ViLD yields actionable, industry-relevant insights by aggregating multiple evaluation angles (semantic and traditional metrics, completeness/faithfulness). It demonstrates the capability gaps and strengths of leading open-source VLMs relative to a proprietary baseline, under a realistic enterprise-driven evaluation.

Conclusion: ViLD provides a practical, task-driven framework that aligns VLM assessment with enterprise deployment needs, enabling better model selection, targeted improvement, and further research into realistic, job-relevant benchmarks for business applications.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [9] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, protocol-aware learning framework called Protocol Genome uses tokenized, de-identified DICOM headers to learn image representations that generalize and calibrate across CT/MRI/CXR, outperforming SSL baselines on external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical imaging variation across sites (protocols, scanners, vendors) introduces latent confounders that degrade image-only models; structured DICOM headers offer a rich signal to learn robust, protocol-aware representations and improve cross-site generalization and calibration.

Method: Tokenize de-identified header fields and fuse with image features using three objectives: protocol-image contrastive learning, masked protocol prediction, and protocol-protocol translation. Trained on 1.26M studies across 7 health systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors (CT, MR, CR/DR). Evaluations cover (A) chest CT triage for pulmonary embolism, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, (C) chest radiograph cardiomegaly detection.

Result: External AUROC improvements: 0.901 vs 0.847 baseline; ECE 0.036 vs 0.058. Calibration improvements of 25–37%; gains persist with only 10–20% labeled data. Relative gains vs strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) and ImageNet transfer. Task-wide improvements: +0.046 (PE), +0.058 (glioma), +0.041 (cardiomegaly). Robust across modalities (CT/MRI/CXR) and vendors; reduces false positives at protocol borders.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that incorporating protocol information via self-supervised learning yields more generalizable, well-calibrated representations suitable for deployment in PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, QIDO/WADO). Includes a model card and deployment guide with de-identification and bias audits; results suggest protocol-aware SSL can extend cross-site imaging performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

### [10] [Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language Models Across Writing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06996)
*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tests whether vision-language models show human-like resilience to glyph perturbations in writing systems; they find current VLMs falter under fragmentation, suggesting a lack of compositional priors for symbol decoding; the work advocates new architectures and training to encode symbol segmentation and binding and provides resources for replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although VLMs excel on clean text, they may not handle symbolic composition and occlusion like humans. The work uses psychophysics-inspired perturbations across Chinese logographs and English words to probe the models' literacy-like robustness and to identify architectural gaps.

Method: Create two psychophysics-inspired benchmarks by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to form 'visible but unreadable' stimuli for both Chinese logographs and English words. Evaluate contemporary VLMs on clean vs perturbed stimuli, analyze outputs for coherence, and release stimuli, prompts, and evaluation protocols.

Result: VLMs show strong performance on clean text but exhibit a severe drop with perturbations, often generating unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern indicates models rely on generic visual invariances rather than compositional priors for decoding symbols and binding across scripts.

Conclusion: Robust literacy-like processing requires architectures and training that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts. The work highlights concrete challenges for education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security in multimodal systems and provides resources to enable replication and follow-up work.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

### [11] [K-Syn: K-space Data Synthesis in Ultra Low-data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06997)
*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes frequency-domain feature-level learning with temporal fusion to synthesize k-space data for dynamic cardiac MRI, enabling robust reconstruction in ultra-low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic CMR is highly dynamic and complex, and high-quality, diverse k-space data are scarce, hindering robust reconstruction.

Method: Learn feature representations in the frequency domain (using Fourier transform as a global feature space) instead of pixels, enabling stable generation with limited data; apply multiple temporal-fusion strategies to integrate k-space data across time frames to guide the generative process.

Result: Demonstrates strong generative ability in low-data regimes and shows potential to alleviate data scarcity for dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain feature-level modeling with temporal fusion provides a stable, rich generative framework for dynamic MRI under data scarcity, improving k-space synthesis and reconstruction robustness.

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

### [12] [Not All Splits Are Equal: Rethinking Attribute Generalization Across Unrelated Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06998)
*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work evaluates whether attribute knowledge can generalize to semantically and perceptually distant categories, revealing strong sensitivity to train-test split design. It introduces progressive train-test splits based on semantic/embedding-based grouping and clustering, finding that performance drops as training-test category correlation decreases; clustering offers the best trade-off between reducing leakage and maintaining learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if current attribute prediction models can abstract and transfer attributes to conceptually distant categories, addressing a gap where prior work focused on narrow, visually similar domains.

Method: Proposes explicit evaluation with train-test splits that progressively reduce correlation between training and test categories using: (1) LLM-driven semantic grouping, (2) embedding similarity thresholding, (3) embedding-based clustering, and (4) supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Tests whether models can infer shared attributes (e.g., 'has four legs') across unrelated object types like dogs and chairs.

Result: A sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among methods, clustering provides the most effective trade-off by reducing hidden correlations while preserving learnability.

Conclusion: Current representations have limited ability to reason about attributes across conceptually distant categories. The work highlights the need for careful benchmark design to measure true generalization in attribute reasoning and suggests clustering-based splits as a promising approach to balance leakage reduction with learnability.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

### [13] [Human-in-the-Loop: Quantitative Evaluation of 3D Models Generation by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07010)
*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a human-in-the-loop, quantitative evaluation framework for LLM-generated 3D CAD models, with a metrics suite and four input modalities; code-based prompts yield perfect reconstruction; accelerates convergence to ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of robust, scalable metrics for assessing geometric and structural fidelity in AI-generated CAD, enabling democratization, reverse engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping.

Method: Develops a comprehensive set of similarity and complexity metrics (volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, topological intricacy), benchmarks against ground-truth CAD references using an L-bracket case study across four modalities (2D orthographic, isometric sketches, geometric structure trees, and code-based corrections).

Result: Found that fidelity improves with semantic richness; code-level prompts achieve perfect reconstruction across all metrics; quantitative evaluation speeds convergence to ground truth vs qualitative approaches.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative CAD models and supports diverse applications, advancing AI-assisted shape synthesis.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

### [14] [MEGS$^{2}$: Memory-Efficient Gaussian Splatting via Spherical Gaussians and Unified Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07021)
*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS^2 introduces memory-efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting by jointly optimizing the total primitive count and per-primitive parameters, replacing spherical harmonics with lightweight oriented spherical Gaussian lobes, and applying a unified soft-pruning constraint to reduce both storage and rendering memory while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers high-quality novel-view synthesis but suffers from prohibitive memory usage, hindering edge-device deployment. Existing compression emphasizes storage and neglects the critical rendering-memory bottleneck.

Method: Replace heavy spherical-harmonic color representations with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes. Introduce a unified soft-pruning framework that casts primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem to reduce both total primitive count and per-primitive parameters.

Result: MEGS^2 achieves approximately 50% reduction in static VRAM and 40% reduction in rendering VRAM compared with prior methods, while preserving comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: MEGS^2 provides a practical, end-to-end solution to memory bottlenecks in 3DGS, enabling more feasible deployment on edge devices by jointly compressing primitives and their parameters without sacrificing visual fidelity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

### [15] [Moment- and Power-Spectrum-Based Gaussianity Regularization for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07027)
*Jisung Hwang,Jaihoon Kim,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified Gaussianity regularization framework for high-dimensional samples that combines moment-based (spatial domain) and power spectrum-based (spectral domain) losses to enforce standard Gaussianity, with permutation invariance. It subsumes prior Gaussianity-based regularizations and improves test-time reward alignment in text-to-image models by reducing reward hacking and accelerating convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stabilize latent-space optimization in text-to-image models by enforcing a standard Gaussian prior on high-dimensional samples, enabling reliable downstream tasks (e.g., reward alignment for aesthetics and text alignment) and addressing inefficiencies of covariance-matching Gaussian regularizations.

Method: Define a composite loss that treats each sample element as a 1D standard Gaussian variable. Apply moment-based regularization in the spatial domain and power spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain, using analytically known expected values to promote Gaussian conformity. Implement permutation invariance by applying the losses to randomly permuted inputs. Show that existing Gaussianity regularizations are special cases of this unified framework; note that covariance-matching corresponds to the spectral loss but with higher time complexity.

Result: Empirically, the framework outperforms previous Gaussianity regularizations, prevents reward hacking in test-time reward alignment for a text-to-image model, and accelerates convergence while improving aesthetics and text alignment.

Conclusion: A unified, efficient Gaussianity regularization framework that subsumes prior methods and enhances stability and convergence in latent-space optimization for generative modeling; broad applicability to other downstream tasks requiring Gaussian-like latent distributions and efficient optimization.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reward-function-guided fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) yields SAM* with improved microscopy segmentation and real-time streaming capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational models are powerful but rely on many opaque tuning knobs; adapting them to domain-specific, streaming microscopy tasks requires interpretable, efficient optimization.

Method: Define physics-informed reward functions (particle size distributions, geometries, and other domain criteria) and optimize SAM hyperparameters to maximize rewards, producing SAM*. Evaluate on microscopy data emphasizing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features to support real-time segmentation.

Result: SAM* shows improved alignment with domain-relevant criteria and better real-time segmentation performance, reducing manual parameter tuning and enhancing adaptability to diverse microscopy tasks.

Conclusion: A reward-driven, physics-informed fine-tuning framework is a practical path to domain-specific adaptation of foundational models in microscopy, with SAM* expanding SAM’s applicability to real-time, task-specific segmentation.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory- and compute-limited streaming classification by reducing data representation via distillation while preserving discriminative features.

Method: Introduce Distillation Based Classification (DBC) that distills essential features from data streams; compare against Hoeffding Trees and Adaptive Random Forest adapted with image embeddings; include Reservoir Sampling Based Classification (RBC) as a baseline.

Result: DBC achieves 73.1% accuracy, surpassing traditional methods and RBC.

Conclusion: Data distillation is a promising avenue for efficient and accurate streaming image classification, establishing a new standard for accuracy and efficiency in streaming settings.

Abstract: This study tackles the challenge of efficiently classifying streaming data in
envi-ronments with limited memory and computational resources. It delves into
the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational
demands while preserving crucial information for accurate classification. Our
investigation com-pares this approach against traditional algorithms like
Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for
image data. The Distillation Based Classification (DBC) demonstrated superior
performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional
methods and Reservoir Sam-pling Based Classification (RBC) technique. This
marks a significant advance-ment in streaming data classification, showcasing
the effectiveness of our method in processing complex data streams and setting

### [18] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-model benchmark (Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation) reveals that large multimodal models amplify gender stereotypes in generated images, with substantial variation across models; one top model reduces bias toward parity, highlighting that bias is influenced by design choices and can be mitigated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological gaps in evaluating gender bias across many LMMs and provide a standardized, scalable, automated tool for assessing fairness in AI-generated images.

Method: Evaluate 13 commercial LMMs using 75 procedurally generated, gender-neutral prompts across male-stereotyped, female-stereotyped, and non-stereotypical professions. Generate 965 images, then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge to score gender representation.

Result: All models show significant bias amplification relative to real-world labor data: men appear in 93.0% of male-stereotyped and 22.5% of female-stereotyped professions; 68.3% men for non-stereotyped roles. Model bias varies widely (46.7%–73.3% male). The top model de-amplified stereotypes and neared gender parity, indicating bias is not inevitable and depends on design choices.

Conclusion: Standardized, automated evaluation tools are necessary to promote accountability and fairness in AI development; model design choices can greatly affect bias, and comprehensive cross-model benchmarks are feasible and informative.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

### [19] [Faster VGGT with Block-Sparse Global Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07120)
*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrofitting transformer-based multi-view reconstruction with block-sparse attention yields up to 4x faster inference without retraining, while maintaining performance on VGGT and pi3 across large image sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense global attention in transformer-based multi-view reconstruction has quadratic complexity, limiting scalability. Empirical observation shows attention mass concentrates on a small subset of patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches, motivating a structured attention approach for efficiency.

Method: Replace dense global attention with highly optimized block-sparse kernels (a structured attention mechanism). Retrofit the backbones (VGGT and pi3) without retraining; extend to large image collections; leverage insights from large language models for the sparsity pattern.

Result: Achieves up to 4× faster inference with comparable task performance; retrofit is applicable to both VGGT and pi3; validated on comprehensive multi-view benchmarks demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable and efficient cross-view attention for feed-forward multi-view reconstruction, enabling larger image sets without retraining and maintaining competitive accuracy; Indicates broader applicability to transformer-based MV reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery for edge-offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to counter subtle pose spoofing, trained on attack-free data and evaluated in an offloaded-VIO setup, achieving lower trajectory/pose errors than no-defense baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge-based VIO is vulnerable to subtle, attack-driven pose spoofing that can accumulate drift and evade simple checks, threatening VR experiences.

Method: Train an unsupervised model on attack-free sessions to learn temporal motion regularities; monitor runtime deviations from learned patterns; upon anomaly, trigger a recovery mechanism to restore pose consistency.

Result: In a realistic offloaded-VIO environment (ILLIXR), the method yields substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error across spoofing intensities compared with a baseline lacking defense.

Conclusion: An unsupervised, label-free defense can effectively detect and recover from pose spoofing in offloaded VIO, reducing drift and maintaining pose integrity without requiring labeled attack data.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

### [21] [Realism to Deception: Investigating Deepfake Detectors Against Face Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07178)
*Muhammad Saad Saeed,Ijaz Ul Haq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face enhancement can significantly undermine deepfake detectors, acting as an anti-forensic tool; basic filters reduce detector accuracy (ASR up to 64.63%), GAN-based enhancements push ASR higher (up to 75.12%); adversarial training assessed but robustness remains limited; highlights need for more resilient forensic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether common face enhancement techniques degrade biometric cues enough to compromise deepfake detectors and to assess their potential as anti-forensic tools across multiple detector types and datasets.

Method: Systematic evaluation using traditional image processing and GAN-based face enhancements on Naive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detectors; datasets include FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2; also includes adversarial training to test whether exposure to enhancements improves robustness.

Result: Enhancement methods significantly degrade detection performance; ASR reaches 64.63% for basic filters and 75.12% for GAN-based enhancements; detectors remain vulnerable across the analyzed categories; adversarial training shows some robustness gains but not sufficient to counteract enhancements.

Conclusion: Face enhancement techniques can function as anti-forensic tools, underscoring the need for forensic methods that are robust and adaptive to enhancement transformations.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

### [22] [Dimensionally Reduced Open-World Clustering: DROWCULA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07184)
*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised open-world clustering for images using Vision Transformer embeddings and manifold learning to discover novel classes, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard datasets with known or unknown cluster counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-world setting requires identifying novel classes without labeled data and with minimal labeling effort; current approaches are largely semi-supervised. This work aims to close the gap by proposing a fully unsupervised solution.

Method: Use Vision Transformer embeddings to estimate the number of clusters (or handle unknown counts) and refine them with manifold learning to exploit the data's intrinsic geometry, improving clustering quality. Demonstrates results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery across CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, Tiny ImageNet; code released as DROWCULA.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery tasks on the listed datasets, valid for both known and unknown cluster-count settings.

Conclusion: Shows that a fully unsupervised approach, combining ViT-based embeddings with manifold learning, can achieve competitive or superior results in open-world image clustering and novel class discovery, with publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The
code is available at: https://github.com/DROWCULA/DROWCULA.

### [23] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model (XBusNet) improves breast ultrasound segmentation by fusing global text-conditioned image semantics with a local boundary-focused path, using automatically generated prompts from metadata. It achieves state-of-the-art Dice 0.8765 and IoU 0.8149 on BLU, with notable gains for small lesions; ablations show complementary global/local and prompt-based contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise BUS segmentation is difficult for small or low-contrast lesions due to fuzzy margins and speckle noise. Weakly localized text cues alone tend to produce coarse results. There is a need to integrate global image semantics with precise local boundaries guided by clinically grounded prompts.

Method: A dual-path model: (1) a global CLIP-ViT-based pathway encoding whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size/location; (2) a local U-Net pathway focused on boundaries. Text prompts describe shape, margin, and BI-RADS terms and are automatically generated from structured metadata. Multimodal fusion modulates the local path with the prompts. Evaluated with five-fold cross-validation on BLU using Dice and IoU, plus size-stratified analyses and ablations.

Result: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art on BLU: mean Dice 0.8765 and IoU 0.8149, outperforming six baselines. Small lesions show the largest gains with fewer misses and fewer spurious activations. Ablations indicate complementary roles for global context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation.

Conclusion: A dual-prompt, dual-branch architecture that merges global semantic information with local edge precision improves BUS segmentation accuracy and robustness, especially for small, low-contrast lesions.

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

*Sepehr Salem,M. Moein Esfahani,Jingyu Liu,Vince Calhoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) augments scarce thermogram data for breast cancer classification; it fuses ResNet-50 deep features with handcrafted Fractal Dimension features from U-Net tumors, achieving 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity with XGBoost; ablation and statistics show DPM augmentation and nonlinear feature fusion are critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical imaging and improve diagnostic performance by combining data augmentation with interpretable features.

Method: DPM-based augmentation; feature fusion of pre-trained ResNet-50 features with handcrafted Fractal Dimension features derived from U-Net segmented tumors; XGBoost classifier.

Result: Achieves 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity; ablation confirms both augmentation and fusion are critical; statistically significant.

Conclusion: Demonstrates synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features to create accurate diagnostic tools in medical imaging.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

### [25] [Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295)
*Ji Xie,Trevor Darrell,Luke Zettlemoyer,XuDong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA is a post-training method for Unified Multimodal Models that uses the model's own visual understanding embeddings as dense text prompts to reconstruct the input image, aligning understanding and generation with minimal compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Caption-based supervision is sparse and often misses fine-grained visual details; RecA provides a resource-efficient way to improve generation/editing fidelity by realigning the model's understanding with its generation using self-supervised signals.

Method: Condition the UMM on its visual encoder embeddings as dense prompts and optimize a self-supervised image reconstruction loss to align understanding with generation. Applicable across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs; demonstrated with ~27 GPU-hours.

Result: Notable improvements on GenEval (0.73→0.90), DPGBench (80.93→88.15), and editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25); claims to surpass larger open-source models; works across diverse UMM architectures.

Conclusion: RecA offers an efficient, general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs that enhances generation and editing fidelity with modest compute and broad applicability.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

*Shucong Li,Zhenyu Liu,Zijie Hong,Zhiheng Zhou,Xianghai Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a UAV multispectral object detector (DEPF) with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided Mamba fusion to tackle low-light fusion, small-target modeling, and quadratic complexity, achieving competitive results on DroneVehicle and VEDAI with linear-complexity-inspired modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multispectral UAV object detection struggles with (1) reduced cross-modality complementarity in low-light images, (2) degraded local small-target modeling due to redundant fusion information, and (3) high quadratic complexity of transformer-based methods unsuitable for UAV platforms.

Method: Introduce DEPF, comprising (1) Dual-Domain Enhancement Module (DDE) with Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba (CSWM) for global brightness and Fourier Details Recovery (FDR) for texture-detail recovery; (2) Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) that uses priority scanning based on modality-difference scores to focus on local targets and suppress redundancy. Built on a linear-complexity Mamba-inspired design for efficiency on UAVs.

Result: Evaluations on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets show DEPF achieves strong detection performance compared with state-of-the-art methods; code is provided in supplementary materials.

Conclusion: DEPF offers an effective and efficient solution for multispectral UAV object detection under challenging lighting and small-target conditions, leveraging dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided fusion to achieve near state-of-the-art results with linear-complexity-inspired design.

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

*Haiqing Ren,Zhongkai Luo,Heng Fan,Xiaohui Yuan,Guanchen Wang,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: G3CN introduces Gaussian topology refinement and gated GRUs into graph convolution for skeleton-based action recognition, improving disambiguation of actions and generalizing across backbones on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs struggle to distinguish ambiguous actions due to limitations in topological and spatial feature representations. The work aims to refine the skeleton topology and enhance inter-joint information flow to better capture subtle action differences.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated Graph Convolution (G3CN). A Gaussian filter refines the skeleton topology graph to better represent ambiguous actions, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are integrated into the GCN framework to improve information propagation between skeleton joints. Demonstrates generalization across various GCN backbones and evaluates on multiple benchmarks.

Result: The method yields improved action recognition performance, especially for ambiguous samples, and demonstrates robust generalization across several backbones and datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA).

Conclusion: Gaussian topology refinement combined with GRU-based information propagation enhances the representational power of GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition, particularly for ambiguous actions, with broad applicability across backbones and benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

### [28] [Parse Graph-Based Visual-Language Interaction for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07385)
*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parse-graph-based visual-language framework (PGVL) with a Guided Module that enables structured cross-modal fusion for robust pose estimation, especially under occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal fusion with global features in HPE often weakens responses in occluded regions and causes misalignment; language priors offer spatial cues but lack structured fusion. A parse-graph and Guided Module approach can preserve local responses while integrating global information.

Method: Stage 1: construct modality-specific parse graphs for visual and language. Stage 2: recursive bidirectional cross-attention between graphs, purified by the Guided Module (GM). GM lets high-semantic nodes guide updates of low-semantic nodes after cross-attention. Employ top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition to integrate modalities.

Result: Validated on major pose estimation datasets; demonstrates effectiveness of PGVL with GM in occlusion handling and cross-modal fusion; code will be released. (No numeric results provided in abstract.)

Conclusion: PGVL with GM enables effective multimodal fusion for HPE, improving occlusion handling and alignment. The approach offers a structured, scalable path for language-augmented HPE and can be extended beyond to related tasks.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

*Ze-Xin Yin,Jiaxiong Qiu,Liu Liu,Xinjie Wang,Wei Sui,Zhizhong Su,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGAA is a modular end-to-end framework that unifies geometry and PBR material generation for 3D assets using multi-view diffusion priors; it achieves superior, data-efficient results and produces relightable meshes from 69k multi-view instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labor- and experience-intensive creation of PBR-ready 3D assets; existing methods separate geometry and texture synthesis and rely on post-processing. Leveraging multi-view diffusion priors enables end-to-end, data-efficient modeling of both geometry and materials.

Method: LGAA comprises three components: (1) LGAA Wrapper, which reuses and adapts layers from multi-view diffusion models to encode geometry and materials; (2) LGAA Switcher, which aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers to fuse different diffusion priors; (3) LGAA Decoder, a tamed variational autoencoder that predicts 2D Gaussian Splatting with PBR channels; followed by a post-processing procedure to extract high-quality, relightable meshes. The approach supports text- and image-conditioned MV diffusion priors and is trained on 69k multi-view instances, enabling flexible incorporation of multiple priors and efficient convergence.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show LGAA achieves superior performance with both text- and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. The framework demonstrates data-efficient convergence and modularity to incorporate multiple priors, leading to high-quality relightable 3D assets.

Conclusion: LGAA offers a versatile, end-to-end solution for PBR-ready 3D asset generation by unifying geometry and material synthesis through multi-view diffusion priors. Its modular design, knowledge-preserving training, and data-efficient convergence enable flexible integration of multiple priors, with code, weights, and dataset to be released on the project page.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

### [30] [In the Eye of MLLM: Benchmarking Egocentric Video Intent Understanding with Gaze-Guided Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07447)
*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gaze-guided egocentric video QA benchmark (EgoGazeVQA) improves MLLM understanding of user intent; combining gaze-aware prompts and fine-tuning yields better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze is a strong, underutilized cue for user intent in egocentric video QA; existing benchmarks neglect gaze, hindering proactive personalized AI assistants.

Method: Create EgoGazeVQA with gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by humans; propose gaze-guided intent prompting that fuses spatial, temporal, and intent cues; perform gaze-related fine-tuning; analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness.

Result: Gaze-guided prompts significantly improve performance; current MLLMs struggle to infer user intent without gaze cues; the effectiveness of prompting depends on the accuracy of gaze estimation.

Conclusion: Incorporating gaze into prompting and fine-tuning is valuable for personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings; gaze-aware MLLMs can better understand user goals in longer daily-life videos.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

*Xudong Lu,Zhi Zheng,Yi Wan,Yongxiang Yao,Annan Wang,Renrui Zhang,Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Qingyun Li,Weifeng Lin,Xiangyu Zhao,Xue Yang,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLEAM-C is a unified cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) framework aligning multiple views and modalities (UAV, street maps, panoramas, ground photos) to satellite imagery, achieving modality-agnostic accuracy with a two-phase training pipeline; it also introduces GLEAM-X, which uses multimodal LLMs for explainable cross-view reasoning, supported by a bilingual benchmark and human-curated test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVGL methods are typically restricted to a single view or modality and rely on opaque visual matching without explanations. There is a need for a unified, interpretable CVGL framework that can handle multiple views/mods and provide rationale for matches.

Method: GLEAM-C unifies multi-view/multi-modality data by aligning all inputs to satellite imagery and employs a two-phase training strategy to reach comparable accuracy to modality-specific baselines with improved training efficiency. GLEAM-X leverages multimodal large language models to perform explainable reasoning for cross-view correspondences. A bilingual benchmark is constructed using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training/testing data, with human refinement of the test set.

Result: The approach achieves training efficiency gains and competitive accuracy relative to modality-specific CVGL models. GLEAM-X enables systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning, and the authors provide a dataset and code (publicly available) to support benchmark and replication.

Conclusion: GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X together form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that couples accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning, advancing geo-localization by enabling models to Explain And Match; code and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

### [32] [XOCT: Enhancing OCT to OCTA Translation via Cross-Dimensional Supervised Multi-Scale Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07455)
*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT introduces Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) to perform layer-aware OCTA reconstruction, addressing motion sensitivity and layer-difference challenges, achieving improved en-face projections on OCTA-500; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality OCTA imaging is needed but is hampered by motion sensitivity and the cost/complexity of modifying OCT hardware. Existing DL OCTA translation methods often ignore layer-specific vascular differences and fail to reconstruct dense vascular details essential for diagnosis.

Method: Propose XOCT framework with CDS and MSFF. CDS uses segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging to produce 2D layer-wise en-face projections as supervision signals, enforcing distinct representations for each retinal layer. MSFF performs multi-scale feature extraction with channel reweighting to enhance vessel delineation across scales. The network targets OCT-to-OCTA layer-aware vascular reconstruction and is evaluated on OCTA-500.

Result: XOCT demonstrates improved en-face projections and layer-aware vascular reconstruction on the OCTA-500 dataset, with better vascular delineation across scales, supporting enhanced clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies.

Conclusion: XOCT can improve accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value of OCTA for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring; the authors provide code at the stated GitHub repository.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Zhenyu Yu,Jinnian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Treats carbon stock estimation as image translation using Swin Transformer-style features from GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM data to improve forest carbon monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest carbon stocks are key for climate mitigation but current monitoring methods combining ground data with satellite imagery have limited accuracy. A more scalable, accurate model is needed.

Method: Use GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM imagery from Huize County; apply style transfer to enable Swin Transformer to extract global features via attention; cast carbon stock estimation as an image translation problem.

Result: The abstract does not present quantitative results; emphasizes the methodological shift and feasibility of translating carbon stock estimation into an image-translation task.

Conclusion: Swin Transformer-based style transfer on multi-sensor imagery is a promising direction for large-scale forest carbon stock assessment, pending empirical validation and comparison with conventional approaches.

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote
sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation.
However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-hoc bias mitigation for vision models using machine unlearning strategies to remove biased samples/representations, improving fairness with minimal accuracy cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs trained on biased data exploit spurious correlations, leading to bias in safety-critical domains. Full retraining or data pipeline redesign is costly; unbiased post-hoc correction via machine unlearning offers a practical alternative.

Method: Investigate Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning and evaluate strategies (Gradient Ascent, LoRA, Teacher-Student distillation) that selectively remove biased samples or feature representations. Build on privacy-preserving unlearning techniques and test on three vision benchmarks: CUB-200-2011 (pose bias), CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), CelebA (gender bias in smile detection).

Result: Substantial reductions in subgroup disparities: demographic parity improvements of up to 94.86% (CUB-200-2011), 30.28% (CIFAR-10), and 97.37% (CelebA). Avg. joint score (utility, fairness, quality, privacy) 0.62 with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Demonstrates machine unlearning as a practical, post-hoc framework to enhance fairness in deployed vision systems without full retraining.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-explainable, patch-based model (MedicalPatchNet) for chest X-ray classification that matches state-of-the-art accuracy while providing explicit patch-level explanations, improving interpretability over Grad-CAM and reducing shortcut learning; code is public.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for interpretable AI in radiology to gain clinical trust and reduce shortcut learning, ensuring that decisions can be traced to meaningful image regions.

Method: Divide images into non-overlapping patches, independently classify each patch, and aggregate patch predictions to produce a final decision; no post-hoc explanation methods. Train on CheXpert (223k images) and evaluate against EfficientNet-B0; interpretability assessed via patch-level localization on CheXlocalize using a mean hit-rate metric and comparison to Grad-CAM.

Result: Classification performance nearly matches EfficientNet-B0 (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908). Demonstrates substantially better interpretability: mean localization hit-rate 0.485 (MedicalPatchNet) vs 0.376 (Grad-CAM). Publicly available code and reproducible scripts.

Conclusion: Providing explicit, reliable explanations improves clinical trust and reduces reliance on spurious shortcuts, contributing to safer and more explainable AI-assisted radiology. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is
publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and
contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical
imaging domains. We make the code publicly available:

*Wenshuo Gao,Xicheng Lan,Luyao Zhang,Shuai Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to animate vector graphics by combining layered implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models, using video score distillation sampling to align motion priors and warping vectors to the learned representations for smooth, high-quality animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics are scalable and preserve color/shape constraints, but animating them is labor-intensive and manual. There is a need to automate vector-graphics animation by leveraging diffusion-based motion priors while maintaining vector properties.

Method: Represent vector graphics with layered implicit neural representations, preserving infinite resolution and color/shape constraints. Optimize these representations using video score distillation sampling that incorporates motion priors from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models. Warp the original vector graphics to align with the learned representations to achieve smooth animation.

Result: Experimental results indicate vivid, natural vector graphic animations with improved flexibility and quality over existing methods, while maintaining vector properties such as infinite resolution and precise color/shape constraints.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges vector graphics and diffusion-based video animation, enabling automated, high-quality vector animations; further work could explore efficiency, generalization to more formats, and potential real-time applications.

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

TL;DR: LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 on indoor navigation with a directional-sequential metric improves step-by-step guidance for visually impaired users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor navigation lacks precise location data and current vision-language models struggle to produce actionable, step-by-step directions for visually impaired users.

Method: Fine-tune BLIP-2 with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. Introduce an evaluation metric that emphasizes directional and sequential aspects (refined BERT F1).

Result: LoRA-enabled BLIP-2 shows significant improvement in generating directional, actionable instructions compared to the original BLIP-2, addressing prior limitations.

Conclusion: Integrating a LoRA-tuned vision-language model with a directional-sequential evaluation metric yields more accurate, usable navigational guidance for indoor, vision-impaired assistance.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

### [39] [Generating Transferrable Adversarial Examples via Local Mixing and Logits Optimization for Remote Sensing Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07495)
*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A local-mixing adversarial framework for non-targeted attacks on remote-sensing DNNs that uses local region blending, logits optimization, and perturbation smoothing to improve transferability; it outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods across six surrogate models on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI, including a 17.28% average boost in black-box success with a ResNet surrogate on MTARSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mixing-based attacks either globally blend images or stitch regions, harming global semantic information; cross-entropy losses can cause gradient vanishing during iterative optimization; there is a need for more transferable non-targeted attacks for remote sensing applications.

Method: Introduce a local mixing strategy that blends only local regions to preserve global semantics, adapt a logit-based loss from targeted attacks for non-targeted optimization, and apply a perturbation-smoothing loss to suppress high-frequency noise and boost transferability.

Result: Empirically demonstrate superior transferability over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models on the FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets; with ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, achieve a 17.28% average improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: The combination of local region mixing, logit-based non-targeted optimization, and perturbation smoothing enhances adversarial transferability in remote-sensing DNNs, offering stronger black-box attack performance and insights for robustness.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

### [40] [MVAT: Multi-View Aware Teacher for Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07507)
*Saad Lahlali,Alexandre Fournier Montgieux,Nicolas Granger,Hervé Le Borgne,Quoc Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAT uses temporal multi-view aggregation and teacher–student distillation to enable weakly supervised 3D object detection from 2D boxes, achieving state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Waymo without 3D box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D annotation is expensive and error-prone. 2D projections suffer from ambiguity, and single-view visibility limits accurate 3D estimation. Leveraging temporal multi-view data can produce denser, more complete 3D object representations under weaker supervision.

Method: Aggregate object-centric point clouds over time to form dense 3D representations. Use a Teacher-Student distillation: the Teacher learns from single viewpoints but targets come from temporally aggregated static objects; it generates high-quality pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for both static and moving objects. A multi-view 2D projection loss enforces consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all available 2D annotations. Evaluated on nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly supervised 3D object detection on nuScenes and Waymo, significantly narrowing the gap with fully supervised methods while requiring no 3D box annotations.

Conclusion: Temporal multi-view aggregation combined with teacher–student distillation is effective for weakly supervised 3D detection, enabling robust 3D boxes from 2D annotations and single-view inputs, and is validated on large-scale datasets with code available.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

*Gianluca Amprimo,Alberto Ancilotto,Alessandro Savino,Fabio Quazzolo,Claudia Ferraris,Gabriella Olmo,Elisabetta Farella,Stefano Di Carlo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal, synchronized gesture dataset (EHWGesture) with 5 gestures, 25 subjects, 1100+ recordings, 6 hours, using RGB-D and event cameras plus motion capture for precise ground-truth, organized by execution speed for action quality; baseline experiments show strong potential for gesture classification, trigger detection, and action quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in dynamic gesture datasets that are multimodal, multi-view, provide precise ground-truth tracking, and embed an action quality component suitable for clinical hand dexterity assessment.

Method: Collect a multimodal dataset using two high-resolution RGB-D cameras and an event camera, with synchronized motion capture for precise hand landmark ground truth; spatial calibration and cross-modal synchronization; label recordings with execution-speed classes representing action quality; provide baseline tasks for gesture classification, trigger detection, and action quality estimation.

Result: Baseline experiments indicate the dataset is viable for multimodal gesture understanding and action quality assessment, demonstrating capabilities for gesture classification, trigger detection, and quality-rated execution.

Conclusion: EHWGesture offers a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal clinical gesture understanding, enabling robust research in gesture recognition, trigger detection, and embedded action-quality analysis.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

### [42] [Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530)
*Kiet T. Nguyen,Chanhuyk Lee,Donggyun Kim,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC) enables adaptation of text-to-image diffusion models to new spatial control tasks using few-shot examples; a matching-based mechanism builds task-specific control features, updating a small parameter set; works across backbones (UNet/DiT); strong data-efficiency (30 examples; 0.1% data) across six tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limited adaptability and high training costs of existing control adapters for novel spatial conditioning in diffusion models, enabling flexible, data-efficient control of image structure.

Method: Leverage analogy between query and support spatial conditions to instantiate task-specific control features. Use a matching mechanism to build features and update a small set of task-specific parameters. Demonstrates backbone-agnostic applicability, working with UNet and DiT backbones, across six novel spatial control tasks.

Result: UFC achieves fine-grained control consistent with novel spatial conditions with only 30 annotated examples; with 0.1% of full training data it matches fully supervised baselines across tasks; demonstrates compatibility with UNet and DiT backbones.

Conclusion: UFC offers a versatile, data-efficient, backbone-agnostic approach for few-shot spatial control in diffusion models, expanding practical applicability of spatial conditioning in T2I generation.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

*Jin Lee,Vu Dang,Gwang-Hyun Yu,Anh Le,Zahid Rahman,Jin-Ho Jang,Heonzoo Lee,Kun-Yung Kim,Jin-Sul Kim,Jin-Young Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HU-based foreground masking for Masked Image Modeling improves 3D medical image segmentation across five datasets, outpacing random masking by focusing on diagnostically meaningful tissue intensities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in MIM overlooks the density distribution of anatomical structures in medical images, potentially harming representation learning; a domain-aware masking strategy could improve segmentation performance.

Method: Introduce an HU-based foreground mask that emphasizes visceral organ intensity distributions while excluding non-tissue regions (air/fluid); apply Masked Image Modeling with this masking strategy on 3D medical scans.

Result: Consistent improvements in segmentation quality and Dice scores across five public datasets: BTCV 84.64% Dice, Flare22 92.43%, MM-WHS 90.67%, Amos22 88.64%, BraTS 78.55%. Implementation available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Conclusion: Domain-centric MIM is a promising direction for representation learning in medical image segmentation, demonstrating the value of HU-guided masking for 3D medical data.

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

*Peijin Xie,Shun Qian,Bingquan Liu,Dexin Wang,Lin Sun,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextlessRAG is the first end-to-end speech-based QA system over document images that eliminates ASR/TTS/OCR, directly interpreting speech to retrieve visual knowledge and generate answers, aided by a layout-aware reranker; also releases a bilingual speech-document RAG dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable knowledge-base question answering over visual documents with spoken queries, addressing the absence of end-to-end speech-only QA over document images and the inefficiencies/ambiguities of ASR/OCR-based pipelines.

Method: An end-to-end framework (TextlessRAG) that processes speech directly to retrieve visual knowledge and generate textless answers, without ASR/TTS/OCR; includes a layout-aware reranking mechanism for refined retrieval; accompanied by a bilingual Chinese-English speech-document RAG dataset.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel direction for speech-based document QA, and provides the first end-to-end textless pipeline plus a bilingual dataset to foster further research; code and data to be released.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at
repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag

*Peng Li,Yisheng He,Yingdong Hu,Yuan Dong,Weihao Yuan,Yuan Liu,Zilong Dong,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast, single-pass framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a single unposed image, using synthetic data from 3D GANs and a coarse-to-fine, dual-branch pipeline that fuses structured spherical triplane features with unstructured point features, avoiding GAN inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for fast, accurate 3D head reconstruction from a single image without costly test-time optimization and without relying on large-scale real 3D head data.

Method: A single forward-pass network that uses a large synthetic dataset generated from trained 3D GANs. A coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline: sparse FLAME points interact with image features via transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, then densified for high fidelity. A dual-branch architecture combines structured spherical triplane features with unstructured point-based features to leverage pretrained 3D-GAN priors for Gaussian head reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show the framework is effective and competitive with existing methods, offering faster reconstruction and rendering by avoiding optimization and leveraging synthetic data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that fast, high-fidelity Gaussian head reconstruction from a single image is feasible using synthetic data and pretrained 3D GANs, and that a dual-branch, coarse-to-fine pipeline effectively fuses structured and unstructured features for 3D head synthesis.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

### [46] [Attention Maps in 3D Shape Classification for Dental Stage Estimation with Class Node Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07581)
*Barkin Buyukcakir,Rocharles Cavalcante Fontenele,Reinhilde Jacobs,Jannick De Tobel,Patrick Thevissen,Dirk Vandermeulen,Peter Claes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CGAT applies graph attention on 3D dental meshes to classify Demirjian stages with interpretable attention maps; combining local curvature and distance features improves performance and explainability; applicable to high-stakes graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for trustworthy, explainable deep learning models in high-stakes domains (medicine/forensics). For 3D shape recognition, CGAT provides interpretable decisions via attention rollouts.

Method: CGAT uses graph attention convolutions on 3D tooth meshes, with directed edges to a global CLS node. Node features evaluated include local mean curvature and distance to centroid, alone and in combination. Attention rollout visualizes explanations. Evaluation on CBCT-derived 3D molar meshes for Demirjian stage classification.

Result: Incorporating local curvature and centroid distance features yields a slight performance gain (weighted F1 around 0.76). Directed edges to a global CLS node produce more intuitive attention maps and maintain good classification accuracy. Attention-based explanations align with predictions, supporting trust and validation. The approach yields broader attention visualizations and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: CGAT offers transparent, competitive graph-based classification, enhancing trust and expert validation in high-stakes contexts. While demonstrated on dental data, it is broadly applicable to graph-based tasks requiring explainability.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

### [47] [Temporal Image Forensics: A Review and Critical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07591)
*Robert Jöchl,Andreas Uhl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive review of temporal image forensics, highlighting biases, explainability, and replication outcomes; suggests a more realistic forensic setting and careful validation of age traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess reliability of age traces from image acquisition and address content bias and explainability concerns to guide robust future research.

Method: Systematic literature review, verification of in-field sensor defect properties, replication of prior methods, experiments showing bias, neural-network analysis, and discussion of a new forensic setting.

Result: Validated properties of sensor defects; demonstrated that some age-estimation methods rely on content bias rather than true age traces; analyzed palmprint dating networks; demonstrated susceptibility to distractors; provided experimental evidence and re-implementation results.

Conclusion: Explainable AI and rigorous validation are essential; adopt a realistic forensic setting; be cautious of content bias; more robust methodologies needed in temporal image forensics.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

### [48] [Bias in Gender Bias Benchmarks: How Spurious Features Distort Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07596)
*Yusuke Hirota,Ryo Hachiuma,Boyi Li,Ximing Lu,Michael Ross Boone,Boris Ivanovic,Yejin Choi,Marco Pavone,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Noa Garcia,Yuta Nakashima,Chao-Han Huck Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spurious non-gender features can distort bias evaluation in vision-language model gender-bias benchmarks. Small perturbations to objects/backgrounds can dramatically shift bias metrics (up to ~175% for generative VLMs, ~43% for CLIP variants). Recommends reporting both bias metrics and feature-sensitivity to obtain robust assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether current gender-bias benchmarks for vision-language models genuinely measure gender bias or are confounded by spurious correlations with non-gender features (objects/backgrounds) across real-world datasets and multiple models.

Method: Systematically perturb non-gender features across four benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, PHASE) and various VLMs, using perturbations such as masking ~10% of objects or mild blurring of backgrounds, then measure changes in bias evaluation metrics.

Result: Bias scores are highly sensitive to small non-gender feature perturbations, with shifts up to 175% in generative VLMs and about 43% in CLIP-based models, indicating that current evaluations may reflect responses to spurious features rather than true gender bias.

Conclusion: Current gender-bias evaluations in VLMs are unreliable due to dependence on spurious features; since creating benchmarks free of such features is difficult, researchers should report bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity analyses to enable more reliable bias assessment.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

*Fangqi Cheng,Surajit Ray,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for 3D medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) that uses synthetic metadata reports and an auxiliary MMSE-prediction token, with lightweight prompt tuning, achieving state-of-the-art Alzheimer's disease diagnosis on MRI using only 1,500 training images—outperforming methods trained on 10,000 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs underutilize patient metadata, lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge, and 3D imaging models struggle due to data and structural information gaps; a data-efficient approach is needed to leverage 3D MRI/CT for AD.

Method: Convert structured metadata into synthetic reports to enrich textual input and train an auxiliary token to predict MMSE scores; apply lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs to 3D MRI, with fine-tuning on a small dataset (1,500 images).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Alzheimer's disease datasets with only 1,500 training images, outperforming methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that synthetic metadata, auxiliary cognitive-score supervision, and prompt-tuning enable data-efficient adaptation of 3D Med-VLMs for AD diagnosis, highlighting the value of integrating clinical knowledge and structured metadata into multimodal models.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

*Fangqi Cheng,Yingying Zhao,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised cross-encoder framework for longitudinal MRI that separates static anatomical features from dynamic temporal changes, yielding improved accuracy and interpretability with strong cross-dataset generalization and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on large labeled datasets and black-box representations in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI by exploiting temporal continuity in longitudinal scans to learn robust, interpretable features.

Method: Disentangle representations into static (contrastive-learning–driven) and dynamic (input-gradient–regularized) components using a cross-encoder, trained self-supervised on longitudinal MRI; fine-tune dynamic/combined features for downstream classification; evaluate on ADNI and transfer to OASIS (zero-shot) and PPMI (cross-task).

Result: Achieves superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability on ADNI; representations generalize to OASIS in a zero-shot setting and to PPMI across tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed two-component, self-supervised framework effectively yields interpretable, transferable representations for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI, with public code to enable replication.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) for latent diffusion models maintains frequency integrity via Hermitian symmetry and adds center-aware embedding to resist cropping, improving robustness and identification performance while preserving image fidelity.


<details>

Motivation: Semantic watermarking for latent diffusion models often loses frequency integrity, which degrades detection; there is a need to preserve frequency structure and resist cropping without sacrificing image quality.

Method: Introduce SFW to enforce Hermitian symmetry in the frequency domain; implement center-aware embedding to mitigate cropping vulnerability; apply SFW to existing semantic watermarking schemes and enhance their frequency-domain structures; perform ablations to evaluate impact on detection, cropping robustness, and capacity vs accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification and identification under various attacks; higher detection accuracy with good image fidelity as shown by FID and CLIP scores; ablations confirm the effectiveness of SFW, center-aware embedding, and capacity effects; code released.

Conclusion: SFW provides an effective framework to balance robustness and image fidelity in semantic watermarking for LDMs, addressing inherent trade-offs; demonstrated through extensive experiments and valid under multiple attack scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

### [52] [Beyond Motion Cues and Structural Sparsity: Revisiting Small Moving Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07654)
*Guoyi Zhang,Siyang Chen,Guangsheng Xu,Zhihua Shen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TenRPCANet uses tensor low-rank plus sparse decomposition with a tokenization/self-attention design to robustly detect small targets in cluttered backgrounds, achieving state-of-the-art results on infrared and space object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small moving target detection in defense scenarios is challenging due to very low SNR, ambiguous cues, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing methods rely on target-specific features or motion cues and lack robustness in complex environments. The paper argues that background structure (low-rank) can serve as a stable prior and that coupling detection with background discrimination is essential.

Method: Formulates detection as a tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition (inspired by RPCA). Introduces TenRPCANet with a tokenization strategy that enforces multi-order tensor low-rank priors via self-attention, capturing local and non-local self-similarity without iterative optimization. Includes a feature refinement module inspired by sparse component updates to enhance target saliency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared small target detection and space object detection, demonstrating strong effectiveness and generalizability across tasks.

Conclusion: By exploiting low-rank background priors and a sparse-aware target refinement within a deep learning framework, TenRPCANet offers robust small target detection in cluttered scenes with minimal target-specific assumptions, suggesting broad applicability to similar detection problems.

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

*Haokai Zhu,Bo Qu,Si-Yuan Cao,Runmin Zhang,Shujie Chen,Bailin Yang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDFFDNet introduces an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network for efficient, depth-aware image registration, aided by Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator and progressive correlation refinement. EDFFDNet-2 adds a local refinement stage. The approach yields large reductions in parameters, memory, and runtime with notable PSNR gains and strong cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-homography and common deformation models struggle with depth disparities in real scenes; there is a need for a deformation representation that is both efficient and robust to depth-induced non-planar motion.

Method: Propose EDFFDNet with exponential-decay basis for free-form deformation, use Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA) to replace MLP-based aggregation, and employ a progressive correlation refinement strategy for coarse-to-fine motion estimation. An optional local refinement stage (EDFFDNet-2) further enhances accuracy.

Result: EDFFDNet achieves 70.5% fewer parameters, 32.6% less memory, and 33.7% less runtime, with a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state of the art. EDFFDNet-2 adds a further 1.06 dB PSNR improvement with continued lower costs. The method generalizes well across datasets and outperforms prior deep-learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of exponential-decay free-form deformation, adaptive sparse motion aggregation, and progressive correlation refinement yields a more efficient and accurate deep image registration framework, particularly in scenes with depth disparities, with strong generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

*Himanshu Singh,A. V. Subramanyam,Shivank Rajput,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new adversarial training approach that projects out inter-class dependencies in feature space to tighten class boundaries, lowering Lipschitz constant and Rademacher complexity, yielding robust and clean accuracy competitive with leading methods across CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inter-class feature overlap as a major factor in adversarial vulnerability and to improve robustness beyond standard adversarial training by explicitly reducing inter-class proximity in the learned representations.

Method: For each adversarial example, identify the nearest inter-class neighbors in feature space and project out their components from both adversarial and clean samples, effectively removing inter-class dependency. Additionally, apply a logits correction that theoretically reduces the Lipschitz constant, thereby lowering the network's Rademacher complexity to improve generalization and robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN shows competitive robustness and clean accuracy compared with leading adversarial training methods, validating the approach’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explicitly mitigating inter-class feature proximity strengthens adversarial robustness and generalization. The logits-correction component theoretically reduces the Lipschitz constant, lowering Rademacher complexity and contributing to improved generalization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

*Sachit Menon,Ahmet Iscen,Arsha Nagrani,Tobias Weyand,Carl Vondrick,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent uses video-modality subagents and a critic to perform complex video reasoning beyond standard perception tasks, achieving strong results on LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL by avoiding fixed procedural steps and enabling dynamic planning based on intermediate module results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the gap where video perception excels on short clips but struggles with complex, longer-horizon reasoning. The paper investigates whether perception capabilities can be orchestrated by an LLM agent to perform multi-step reasoning on videos.

Method: Develop an LLM-driven agent that interacts with video-processing modules (as subagents/tools). Instead of a fixed reasoning procedure, the agent selects subsequent steps based on outputs from each module call. Introduce a critic that distinguishes successful versus unsuccessful reasoning sequences to guide improvement.

Result: The combination of the agent and the critic yields strong performance on LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, indicating improved capability for complex video reasoning over perception-alone baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating perception modules with an adaptive, critiqued LLM agent can extend video reasoning beyond current perception benchmarks, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, multi-step video reasoning systems. Future work may explore broader datasets, more module types, and further refinement of the critic.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC uses segmentation-guided multi-entropy models for lossless image compression, enabling region-specific probability estimation and ROI coding, achieving state-of-the-art compression with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-entropy-model approaches fail to capture diverse statistics across semantic regions; segment-aware models can better estimate pixel distributions and improve compression.

Method: Extract image features, perform semantic segmentation to identify regions, assign a specialized entropy model to each region, and model pixel distributions with a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood. Also supports ROI coding via the segmentation mask; implementation details are abstracted here.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on benchmark datasets with minimal encoding/decoding latency; includes ROI coding capability.

Conclusion: Segmentation-guided, region-wise entropy modeling effectively improves lossless image compression while maintaining efficiency and enabling ROI support.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

### [57] [XSRD-Net: EXplainable Stroke Relapse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07772)
*Christian Gapp,Elias Tappeiner,Martin Welk,Karl Fritscher,Stephanie Mangesius,Constantin Eisenschink,Philipp Deisl,Michael Knoflach,Astrid E. Grams,Elke R. Gizewski,Rainer Schubert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning on 3D CTA and clinical data shows promise for predicting stroke recurrence and relapse-free survival, achieving test AUCs of 0.84 (Task 1) and 0.71 (Task 2, with c-index 0.68), but needs more data for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke recurrence carries high mortality; early risk detection and therapy planning are crucial to reduce relapses and deaths.

Method: Data: 3D intracranial CTA plus tabular data (heart diseases, age, gender) from 2010–2024. Models: single- and multimodal deep learning networks for Task 1 (relapse detection) and Task 2 (relapse-free survival time prediction with subsequent classification). The multimodal XSRD-net fuses vision (CTA) and tabular data; interpretability analyses link cardiac conditions and carotid arteries to relapse risk.

Result: Task 1 relapse detection achieved AUC 0.84 on test data using tabular data. For Task 2 (RFS time prediction), the multimodal XSRD-net reported a vision:tabular modality contribution of 0.68:0.32, c-index 0.68 for relapse, and test AUC 0.71. Deeper interpretability highlighted associations between heart diseases and carotid arteries.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for early relapse risk stratification and RFS prediction, with clear multimodal gains; however, results are data-limited and ongoing data collection and model retraining are planned to strengthen robustness and clinical insight.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

*Yimin Pan,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) to strand-level hair reconstruction from multi-view images via a multi-stage pipeline: differentiable Gaussian rasterization, merging Gaussian segments into coherent strands, and photometric refinement; introduces a topology-aware evaluation metric; robust across hairstyles and efficient (around 1 hour).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hair reconstruction is challenging due to complex strand topology; existing geometry-focused methods neglect connectivity and topology. 3DGS provides efficient, explicit representations that align with hair structure, but a strand-level reconstruction with topology-aware evaluation is needed for realistic digital humans and VR.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) reconstruct detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian rasterizer; (2) merge individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands with a novel merging scheme; (3) refine and grow strands under photometric supervision. Also introduces a new evaluation metric that proxies topological accuracy for strand reconstruction. The approach uses multi-view images to supervise the geometry and topology.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show robust performance across a wide range of hairstyles and efficient reconstruction, typically completing within one hour. The proposed topology-aware evaluation metric provides a proxy measure for strand connectivity accuracy.

Conclusion: The work delivers a practical strand-level hair reconstruction framework built on 3DGS, bridging geometry and topology through a novel merging strategy and photometric refinement, and introducing a topology-aware evaluation metric. It advances VR/digital human modeling by producing coherent hair strands efficiently, with resources and code likely available on the project page.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX accelerates RayGauss by integrating empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling, improved ray coherence, scale regularization, and a distant-region densification criterion, delivering 5–12x faster training, 50x–80x higher FPS, and up to +0.56 dB PSNR on real-world scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the high computational cost of the state-of-the-art RayGauss while preserving or improving rendering quality to enable real-world deployment and real-time-like performance.

Method: Builds on RayGauss' irregular elliptical basis function representation with BVH-ray casting and adds: (1) volumetric rendering acceleration (empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling), (2) enhanced ray coherence, (3) scale regularization to mitigate false-positive intersections, and (4) a new densification criterion to improve density distribution in distant regions.

Result: Reported 5x–12x faster training and 50x–80x higher FPS on real-world datasets; visual quality improved by up to 0.56 dB PSNR; project page provided for videos and code.

Conclusion: RayGaussX demonstrates that targeted acceleration and density-distribution strategies can substantially reduce training and rendering costs while improving or preserving visual quality, making real-world neural rendering more practical.

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised, multi-view fusion of two orthogonal LR MR images to reconstruct high-resolution details. Uses a sparse coordinate-based loss for arbitrary scaling and combines offline and online phases for fast patient-specific SR, achieving comparable or superior results to SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce MR acquisition time and improve interpretability by combining two LR, orthogonal scans into a unified, high-resolution representation, alleviating the need for radiologists to analyze LR images separately.

Method: A multi-view neural network fuses two orthogonal LR MR images. Trained in a self-supervised manner without HR data; employs a sparse coordinate-based loss to handle arbitrary upsampling scales; incorporates a patient-agnostic offline phase and a patient-specific online phase to speed up reconstruction.

Result: Evaluated on MR data from two cohorts; achieves comparable or improved SR performance vs. state-of-the-art self-supervised SR methods across various upsampling scales; online phase yields up to 10x speed-up for patient-specific reconstruction while maintaining SR quality.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality SR from two LR MR scans without HR supervision, offering efficient online reconstruction and practical applicability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill uses depth-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting with joint depth/object supervision and a consistency-aware refinement to inpaint missing regions, achieving higher perceptual quality and faster training than prior NeRF/3DGS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructions, missing regions due to occlusion or edits produce blur, artifacts, and geometry inconsistencies; there is a need for accurate placement and coherent inpainting in 3D space.

Method: Combine two supervision signals: (1) depth-based guidance to place Gaussians correctly in 3D, and (2) object-based supervision to align with surrounding geometry; add a consistency-aware refinement that identifies and corrects inconsistent regions selectively while preserving the rest of the scene.

Result: On SPIn-NeRF dataset, SplatFill outperforms existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity and reduces training time by 24.5%; qualitative results show sharper details, fewer artifacts, and better cross-view coherence.

Conclusion: SplatFill delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality for 3DGS inpainting with improved efficiency, addressing inpainting challenges in 3D scene representations.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

*Zhuoxu Huang,Mingqi Gao,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework (PLM) bridges LLMs and dense 3D point clouds for accurate segmentation via object-centric tokens and a geometry-aware decoder, yielding strong gains without heavy pre-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs operate on high-level semantic tokens while 3D point clouds are dense geometric data; this representation mismatch limits both input comprehension and precise outputs, leading to vulnerability to distractors and loss of fine-grained geometry.

Method: Introduce OcDR (object-centric discriminative representation) with hard negative-aware training to learn target semantics and scene relations; introduce GRD (geometric reactivation decoder) to predict masks by fusing OcDR tokens with corresponding dense features, preserving dense geometry without large pre-alignment.

Result: Significant gains in 3D referring segmentation: +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer; consistent improvements across 7 benchmarks and 4 tasks.

Conclusion: PLM demonstrates effective object-centric reasoning to bridge LLMs and 3D geometry, improving robustness to distractors and generalization across diverse 3D understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, timely burned area mapping is essential for environmental monitoring, disaster response, and climate assessment, but existing datasets and models struggle with cross-region generalization and boundary delineation. AlphaEarth provides high-resolution optical and thermal data with rich ground-truth annotations to train robust detectors, and MTBS regions offer credible training in the US for broader transferability.

Method: Train an ensemble of Siamese U-Net models leveraging the AlphaEarth dataset, with MTBS-derived ground truth in contiguous US, and evaluate on 17 European regions to assess transferability and generalization.

Result: Overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 0.74 on the test dataset; strong performance in partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries; demonstrated transferability across diverse ecosystems.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, generalizable solution for global burn area monitoring and automated fire damage assessment, leveraging AlphaEarth to enable robust detection across varied landscapes.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental
monitoring, disaster management, and assessment of climate change. This study
presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

### [64] [D-LEAF: Localizing and Correcting Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Layer-to-head Attention Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07864)
*Tiancheng Yang,Lin Zhang,Jiaye Lin,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A layer- and head-aware diagnostic-and-correction framework for multimodal LLMs that localizes hallucinations to specific layers (LIAE) and heads (IAF) and dynamically corrects them at inference with D-LEAF, yielding substantial gains with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs stem from misaligned visual attention. Prior detectors uniformly adjust across layers/heads and poorly localize the source of errors, motivating a fine-grained diagnostic approach.

Method: Introduce Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) to flag anomalous layers and Image Attention Focus (IAF) to score attention heads within those layers. Develop Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), which uses these signals to dynamically localize and correct errors during inference with negligible overhead.

Result: D-LEAF achieves a 53% relative improvement on standard image captioning benchmarks. In VQA, accuracy and F1-score improve by ~4%, with substantially reduced hallucinations and maintained efficiency.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, task-agnostic diagnostics (LIAE, IAF) plus dynamic correction (D-LEAF) effectively localize and mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, improving captioning and VQA performance without adding significant overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active MINT proposes a multitask learning setup to detect whether data were used in training by training an Audited Model and a MINT Model that uses intermediate activations; it achieves >80% accuracy across 5 benchmarks, outperforming prior methods and enhancing model auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve transparency, accountability, and safeguards in AI by auditing training data usage; address privacy, security, and copyright concerns.

Method: Train two models simultaneously: the Audited Model and a secondary MINT Model. The MINT Model uses intermediate activation maps as inputs to its layers and is trained to identify data used for training the Audited Model. The training process includes an optimization objective for auditability. Evaluated across architectures from lightweight MobileNet to Vision Transformers on five public benchmarks.

Result: Active MINT achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting whether given data were used for training, significantly outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: Contributes to transparency and safeguards in AI, enabling stronger security, privacy, and copyright protection through auditable training processes.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

### [66] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCNet introduces object-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation by mining general objects and aligning with target prototypes, to suppress hard pixel noise and improve performance; reports state-of-the-art results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-level correlations in FSS suffer from hard pixel noise due to background clutter, causing background overfitting. Object-level identification of novel objects is more reliable in low-data regimes, motivating a shift from image-wide to object-level reasoning.

Method: General Object Mining Module (GOMM) constructs query general object features by learning saliency and high-level similarity cues, capturing both background and foreground regions. Correlation Construction Module (CCM) allocates target prototypes to match these general object features, forming an object-level correlation that guides segmentation and suppresses background noise.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on standard FSS benchmarks (PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i).

Conclusion: Object-level correlation effectively mines the target in query images and reduces hard pixel noise, offering a promising direction for improving FSS beyond traditional image-level correlations.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

*Ao Li,Jinpeng Liu,Yixuan Zhu,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreHOI uses diffusion priors and score-guided sampling to jointly reconstruct human-object interactions from images, guided by physical constraints and a contact-driven refinement, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous HOI optimization methods struggle to produce physically plausible reconstructions due to a lack of priors on human-object interactions, leading to unrealistic poses and contacts.

Method: Introduce ScoreHOI, a diffusion-based optimizer that leverages diffusion priors to model the conditional distribution of human and object poses given image observations and object features. During inference, guide the denoising process with physical constraints and employ a contact-driven iterative refinement to improve contact plausibility.

Result: Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks show ScoreHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering precise and robust joint HOI reconstruction.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI provides a principled diffusion-based framework for HOI reconstruction that integrates priors, physical constraints, and contact refinement to achieve superior performance and plausibility.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

### [68] [Multimodal Contrastive Pretraining of CBCT and IOS for Enhanced Tooth Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07923)
*Moo Hyun Son,Juyoung Bae,Zelin Qiu,Jiale Peng,Kai Xin Li,Yifan Lin,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToothMCL introduces a multimodal contrastive pretraining framework for tooth segmentation using paired CBCT and IOS data, introduces the CBCT-IOS3.8K dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art Dice scores with strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tooth segmentation is essential in digital dentistry. Current methods often lack rigorous validation, show limited performance, and struggle with cross-modality generalization. A modality-invariant representation bridging volumetric CBCT and surface IOS is needed, along with a large paired dataset to enable robust evaluation.

Method: A multimodal contrastive learning framework (ToothMCL) that learns modality-invariant representations across CBCT (volumetric) and IOS (surface-based). Pretrained on paired CBCT–IOS data, then applied to multi-class tooth segmentation with FDI numbering. Introduced CBCT-IOS3.8K, a large paired dataset of 3,867 patients, for training and evaluation across diverse datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in internal and external testing. Dice score improvements: +12% for CBCT segmentation and +8% for IOS segmentation. Demonstrates robust generalizability across imaging conditions and clinical scenarios, including tooth groups and FDI numbering.

Conclusion: Multimodal pretraining for tooth segmentation improves accuracy and generalizability. The ToothMCL framework and the CBCT-IOS3.8K dataset establish a new benchmark for digital dentistry segmentation and offer better potential for practical clinical deployment.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

*Mahmudul Islam Masum,Miad Islam,Arif I. Sarwat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a model-independent Two-Pass Adaptive Inference to bridge the gap between benchmark detector performance and real-time viability on consumer GPUs. Achieves 1.85x speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline on COCO with 5.51% mAP loss by using a fast low-resolution pass and a selective high-resolution second pass, within a hardware-aware evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical gap between high benchmark performance of object detectors and their real-time usability on consumer-grade hardware. System-level bottlenecks on laptops with GPUs (not just compute limits) call for hardware-aware inference strategies and evaluation frameworks like early-exit vs resolution-adaptive routing.

Method: A model-independent Two-Pass Adaptive Inference: run a fast, low-resolution pass first; escalate to a high-resolution pass only when detection confidence is low. The study also provides a unified evaluation framework to compare architectural early-exit and resolution-adaptive routing strategies.

Result: On a 5000-image COCO dataset, the approach yields a 1.85x speedup compared with a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mean Average Precision (mAP) loss of 5.51%.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical, reproducible blueprint for deploying high-performance real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by prioritizing hardware-aware inference strategies over sole model optimization, trading a small accuracy loss for substantial throughput gains.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

*Bala Prenith Reddy Gopu,Timothy Jacob Huber,George M. Nehma,Patrick Quinn,Madhur Tiwari,Matt Ueckermann,David Hinckley,Christopher McKenna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction for tumbling, uncooperative RSOs using an Isaac Sim-based pipeline; static-scene results with Neuralangelo show close CAD-model fidelity and fine-detail capture; establishes a baseline for dynamic reconstruction evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing uncooperative resident space objects is essential for on-orbit servicing and active debris removal, requiring accurate geometry and motion properties. Reconstructing tumbling targets is challenging, necessitating systematic evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms to achieve high geometric fidelity.

Method: Developed a simulation environment in Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of tumbling satellites under realistic orbital lighting. Evaluated state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods with focus on geometric accuracy. Reported preliminary static-scene results using Neuralangelo, with meshes compared to CAD models using Cloud Compare.

Result: 3D meshes closely match original CAD models with minimal errors and artifacts. Reconstructed models capture critical fine details relevant for mission planning. Neuralangelo-based reconstruction shows promising fidelity in static scenes and provides a baseline for dynamic-scene evaluation.

Conclusion: The work provides a baseline for ongoing evaluation of dynamic scene reconstruction in OOS/ADR contexts; initial static results are promising and set the stage for extending analysis to dynamic, tumbling scenarios.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

*Kimiaki Shirahama,Miki Yanobu,Kaduki Yamashita,Miho Ohsaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A guided diffusion decoder that generates images whose features closely match a user-specified target, enabling zero-shot analysis of DNN feature spaces across CLIP, ResNet-50, and ViT on a single consumer GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of DNN feature extraction and understand what attributes are encoded. The paper provides a method with a guaranteed proximity between generated image features and a user-specified feature, enabling evidence of which attributes are encoded.

Method: A guided diffusion model that steers the reverse image generation of a pretrained diffusion model to minimize the Euclidean distance between the current image's feature (estimated at each step) and the user-specified feature. It requires no additional training and can analyze feature spaces across different DNNs on a single consumer GPU.

Result: Images generated by the decoder have features remarkably close to the user-specified targets, revealing valuable insights into the feature spaces of the DNNs tested (CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50, and ViT). The approach works in a zero-training, single-GPU setting and generalizes across models.

Conclusion: The proposed decoder offers a practical, training-free tool for probing and comparing DNN feature spaces, enabling analysis of which attributes are encoded in different networks and facilitating cross-model, hardware-accessible exploration.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual-TableQA is a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset for visual reasoning over tabular data, featuring 2.5k LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k QA pairs generated via a multi-LLM collaborative pipeline. It is cost-efficient (<$100) and aims to diversify reasoning patterns through inspiration and jury filtering, improving VLMs' generalization on external benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a notable gap in visual reasoning over structured data, especially from rendered tables. Existing benchmarks lack scale, diversity, and depth, hindering robust evaluation and training of vision-language models on complex tabular reasoning.

Method: A modular, autonomous data-generation pipeline with multiple LLMs assigned distinct roles (generation, validation, inspiration). The pipeline uses cross-model prompting and LLM-jury filtering to create diverse layouts, topics, and reasoning patterns. Output includes 2.5k LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k QA pairs, produced under USD 100. The process fosters collaboration between stronger and weaker models to distill diverse reasoning. The dataset and resources are released publicly.

Result: Fine-tuned models on Visual-TableQA generalize well to external benchmarks and outperform several proprietary models despite synthetic origin, indicating strong transferability of learned visual-table reasoning. The authors also provide access to the full pipeline and resources, enabling replication and extension.

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA provides a scalable, open-domain resource that enhances visual reasoning over complex tabular data, enabling broader benchmarking and improved model generalization. The synthetic nature is offset by demonstrated transferability, with a practical, low-cost generation pipeline and public availability encouraging adoption and further research.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

*Xin Lai,Junyi Li,Wei Li,Tao Liu,Tianjian Li,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3 scales tool-based interactions to tens of turns for deep multi-turn visual reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art on difficult visual search tasks via the Visual Probe Dataset, an iterative cold-start data-collection pipeline, and an over-turn masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source image-based tools with reinforcement learning often exhibit monotonous reasoning and support only a limited number of interactions, which fails on tasks requiring trial-and-error exploration. There is a need to enable scalable, long-horizon exploratory reasoning in multimodal agents.

Method: 1) Construct the Visual Probe Dataset of challenging visual search problems. 2) Develop an iterative data-collection pipeline to obtain diverse cold-start trajectories (depth-first search, trial-and-error, goal maintenance). 3) Propose an over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses during RL, balancing training efficiency with test-time scalability. 4) Train with an upper bound of six interaction turns but deploy at test time with tens of turns, observing accuracy gains with more turns.

Result: Mini-o3 yields rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking paths, enabling effective solving of challenging visual search problems and achieving state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.

Conclusion: Scaling tool-based interactions with curated data, diverse exploratory trajectories, and over-turn masking enables deep, scalable exploratory reasoning in multimodal models, suggesting a viable path to improve performance on complex visual tasks without prohibitive training costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

*Zheng Geng,Nan Wang,Shaocong Xu,Chongjie Ye,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Sida Peng,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen advances single-view 6D pose estimation for unseen objects by pairing a coarse-to-fine alignment that refines scale and pose (via multi-view feature matching and render-and-compare refinement) with a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy to diversify textures for synthetic fine-tuning. It achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks and enables real-robot grasping, demonstrating practicality in real-world manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single image is challenging due to the scarcity of precise 3D models, the lack of metric scale in single-view reconstructions, and domain gaps between synthetic/generator models and real images. These factors hinder robustness in long-tail real-world object instances and robotic manipulation.

Method: Two key components: (1) a coarse-to-fine alignment module that jointly refines scale and pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement; (2) a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy to diversify textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with synthetic data.

Result: On challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. The method also demonstrates robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating its practicality for real-world manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation, bridging the sim-to-real gap via text-guided domain randomization and achieving practical performance for real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

Motivation: Text-only supervision biases training away from detailed visual cues; current multimodal LLMs underperform on vision-centric tasks requiring counting or spatial reasoning; there is a need to leverage rich visual representations from VFMs to guide training.

Method: VIRAL applies a regularization term that explicitly aligns the internal visual representations of an MLLM with those of pre-trained VFMs, enabling retention of input vision encoder details and integration of external visual knowledge from VFMs; evaluated via regime of multimodal benchmarks with ablations to validate design choices.

Result: The approach yields consistent improvements across multiple widely used multimodal benchmarks; comprehensive ablations corroborate the effectiveness of the core design choices.

Conclusion: A simple, effective alignment strategy for visual representations can significantly enhance visual reasoning in MLLMs, pointing to a productive direction for integrating VFMs into vision-language learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

### [76] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an optimization approach using deviation maximization under interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets to determine partially known feature weights in MCDM, applied to renewable energy source selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses uncertainty and fuzziness in human judgments within multi-criteria decision-making; extends fuzzy theory with Fermatean fuzzy sets; emphasizes both the technical problem of selecting renewable energy sources and the associated managerial/political implications.

Method: Proposes an optimization model based on deviation maximization to determine partially known feature weights, integrated with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets in a fuzzy MCDM framework.

Result: Applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources, illustrating applicability in balancing energy needs, carbon emissions, and climate considerations; discusses the managerial and political implications of renewables decisions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that combining Fermatean fuzzy MCDM with deviation-based optimization can support informed decision-making under uncertainty in renewable energy policy and management, highlighting the need to consider policy and organizational factors alongside technical considerations.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR is a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and reasons in the graph spectral domain, delivering faster, more robust, and more interpretable reasoning than strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify symbolic interpretability with scalable, data-driven spectral learning for knowledge-graph reasoning, addressing limitations of purely neural or symbolic approaches and enabling robust uncertainty-aware inference with potential modular extensions.

Method: A graph-signal-processing architecture that encodes logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference in the Laplacian eigenbasis, plus extensions: dynamic graph/basis learning, rational and diffusion spectral filters, mixture-of-spectral-experts, spectral curricula with proof guidance, uncertainty quantification; optional coupling with large language models, co-spectral transfer, adversarial robustness, generalized Laplacians, causal interventions; efficient GPU kernels.

Result: On ProofWriter and CLUTRR, Spectral NSR achieves higher accuracy, faster inference, and improved robustness and interpretability compared with transformers, MPNNs, and neuro-symbolic systems; spectral attribution and proof-band analyses align with symbolic proofs; co-spectral transfer supports domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Spectral NSR provides a scalable, principled foundation for next-generation reasoning, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional neural-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI lacks guarantees on correctness, safety, and fairness; statistical methods offer promising approaches to improve reliability, evaluation, and experimental design in AI systems.

Method: A literature review that explains general statistical techniques and their applications to generative AI, synthesizing existing work and providing a framework for future research.

Result: No new empirical results are presented; the paper compiles, categorizes, and analyzes existing work on statistics-informed reliability, evaluation, and interventions in generative AI, highlighting applications and limitations and proposing directions.

Conclusion: Statistical methods can enhance the reliability and evaluation of generative AI; the paper identifies limitations and outlines potential future research directions and opportunities for integrating statistics with generative models.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

### [79] [Instruction Agent: Enhancing Agent with Expert Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07098)
*Yinheng Li,Hailey Hultquist,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GUI agent named Instruction Agent uses a single expert demonstration to derive step-by-step instructions and execute them exactly as demonstrated, with verifier and backtracker to handle interruptions, achieving 60% success on OSWorld tasks where top agents failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon planning, and personalized trajectories; there is a need for reliable, reusable automation that can adapt to interruptions and new UI layouts by leveraging demonstrations.

Method: From one demonstration, extract a sequence of actionable steps (instructions) and execute them by strictly following the demonstrated trajectory. Use a verifier to assess progress after each action and a backtracker to recover from unexpected interruptions (e.g., pop-up windows) by re-evaluating the outcome and retrying as needed.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the Instruction Agent attains about 60% success on OSWorld tasks where top-ranked agents fail.

Conclusion: The Instruction Agent offers a practical, extensible framework that bridges current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation, with potential for scaling and broader applicability through more demonstrations.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

*Sania Sinha,Tanawan Premsri,Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks analyzing their technical facets and expressivity. Finds a dominance of algorithm-centric work over generic declarative problem-specification tools, with three exemplars (DeepProbLog, Scallop, DomiKnowS) used to illustrate capabilities and limitations. Calls for action to develop unified, user-friendly NeSy frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks in Neurosymbolic research, and to map the landscape of existing frameworks in order to understand expressivity and practical deployment potential.

Method: Characterize and compare the technical facets of NeSy frameworks: symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and underlying learning/inference algorithms. Use DeepProbLog, Scallop, and DomiKnowS as representative exemplars to assess expressivity and limitations, and identify challenges.

Result: The analysis reveals that most NeSy work prioritizes algorithms over generic declarative problem-specification frameworks. It identifies challenges across symbolic representation, neural-symbolic integration, and learning/inference, and discusses the expressivity of the three exemplar frameworks in addressing a range of problems.

Conclusion: A call for transformative action: develop unified, user-friendly declarative NeSy frameworks to supplement algorithmic approaches, expand expressivity, and accelerate community progress in Neurosymbolic research.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [81] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight 1D convolutional autoencoder with an LSTM bottleneck reconstructs clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated ECG data, enabling robust sympathetic nervous system monitoring under high EMG noise; achieves substantial SNR gains, higher correlation to clean SKNA, preserved burst features, and high stress-classification accuracy even with severe noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SKNA provides a noninvasive window into sympathetic nervous system dynamics but is highly susceptible to EMG contamination; traditional bandpass filtering cannot reliably separate overlapping spectral components during muscle activity, impairing burst detection and SNS assessment.

Method: Train a lightweight 1D convolutional autoencoder with an LSTM bottleneck to denoise EMG-contaminated SKNA. Use clean SKNA derived from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise from chaotic muscle stimulation to simulate contamination at realistic SNRs (--4 dB, --8 dB). Employ leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Evaluate denoising performance via SNR gain, cross-correlation with clean SKNA, restoration of burst-based features (AUROC), and baseline vs cognitive-stress classification. 

Result: SNR improved up to 9.65 dB; cross-correlation with clean SKNA increased from 0.40 to 0.72; burst-based SKNA features restored with AUROC ≥ 0.96; stress classification accuracy 91–98% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based reconstruction can preserve physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts under substantial EMG interference, enabling robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic, movement-rich environments.

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL uses Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to improve Text-to-SQL; achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and strong industrial performance, with two RL pipelines and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with industry-scale databases and domain-specific business logic, leading to low execution accuracy on complex queries; need reasoning-driven learning to bridge the gap between benchmarks and real-world use.

Method: Two pipelines: (1) in-context learning with group self-evaluation (verbal-RL) using open- and closed-source LLMs as backbones; (2) a chain-of-thought RL pipeline with OmniSQL-7B trained with a specially designed reward and two-stage RL. Introduces Partial-Match Rewards to guide learning. Evaluated on Spider, Spider 2.0, BIRD, and Spider2.0-SQLite.

Result: SOTA on Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD. On Spider2.0-SQLite industrial benchmark, verbal-RL achieves 7.4% higher execution accuracy than SOTA; CoT pipeline is 1.4% higher. Mixed-dialect RL training yields threefold gains, especially for dialects with limited data.

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic industrial constraints, demonstrating the effectiveness of verbal reinforcement learning and partial-match rewards; code is publicly available for replication.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

TL;DR: FETCH classifier for legal issue classification with ensemble methods and follow-up questions; achieves 97.37% hits@2 on 419 real-world queries, outperforming GPT-5 at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce misdirection in legal aid triage to prevent deadlines, abuse, housing loss, or custody issues; enable efficient routing to appropriate resources.

Method: Introduce FETCH classifier; two improvements: 1) hybrid LLM/ML ensemble; 2) automatic generation of follow-up questions to enrich initial narrative; dataset of 419 real-world queries; evaluation against baselines including GPT-5.

Result: Hits@2 97.37% with inexpensive models; surpasses GPT-5; demonstrates cost-effective, high-accuracy classification; potential reduction in misrouting harms.

Conclusion: Approach shows promise for scalable, affordable legal-aid triage with better routing accuracy; potential for broader deployment with further validation and dataset expansion.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-LSTM intrusion detection system (IDS) for SCADA-based smart grids achieves high detection performance on DNP3 and IEC104 datasets, indicating improved cyber threat identification over other deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grids' integration of renewables and modern communication increases efficiency but also expands attack surfaces, risking privacy, outages, and operational disruption; robust IDS are needed to protect SCADA protocols like DNP3 and IEC 104.

Method: A hybrid CNN-LSTM model is used to detect cyber threats. CNNs extract spatial features from network data, while LSTMs capture temporal patterns. The model is trained and evaluated on DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion datasets.

Result: The approach yields high performance with an accuracy of 99.70% and improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to other deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM IDS shows strong potential for enhancing smart-grid cybersecurity, leveraging both spatial and temporal feature learning; further work should assess generalization across more datasets and real-world deployment considerations.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small Language Models can match LLMs in health prediction tasks on mobile devices, with better efficiency and privacy, but face challenges with class imbalance and few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and latency concerns of cloud-based LLMs in mobile healthcare; explore if compact, on-device models can provide adequate predictive performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of SLMs on health prediction tasks under zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction tuning; deployment of the best fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to assess real-world efficiency and predictive performance.

Result: SLMs achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial efficiency and privacy gains; challenges persist in handling data imbalance and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: SLMs are a promising path for privacy-preserving, on-device healthcare monitoring, though further work is needed to address class imbalance and few-shot limitations.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Longer intermediate reasoning traces (ITG/CoTs) do not reliably indicate problem difficulty or adaptive computation; trace length largely reflects distributional similarity to training data rather than true problem complexity.

Motivation: Questioning the common assumption that intermediate reasoning traces reflect problem-adaptive computation and thinking effort; to understand what trace length actually signals about problem difficulty.

Method: Train transformer models from scratch on derivational traces of the A* search algorithm for maze problems with known complexity; evaluate on trivial free-space problems and on out-of-distribution problems; compare intermediate trace length with ground-truth A* trace length and solution success.

Result: Models often generate excessively long reasoning traces even for simple tasks and may fail to produce a solution; trace length only loosely correlates with A* trace length, and mainly when problems are near training distribution; suggests recall from training data rather than genuine adaptive computation governs trace length.

Conclusion: Intermediate trace generation is not necessarily adaptive to problem difficulty; longer traces should not be automatically interpreted as higher thinking effort; distributional distance from training data is a key driver of trace length.

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

*Cunxi Yu,Rongjian Liang,Chia-Tung Ho,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SATLUTION scales LLM-driven code evolution from kernel-level experiments to full repository-scale SAT solvers, achieving state-of-the-art results and surpassing human champions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend autonomous code evolution from small kernels to complete software repos and tackle a canonical hard problem (SAT). The goal is to demonstrate scalable, correct-by-construction, automated solver evolution capable of beating top human benchmarks.

Method: Orchestrates LLM agents to autonomously evolve large SAT solver repositories (hundreds of files, tens of thousands of C/C++ lines) with strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback. It also self-evolves its own evolution policies and rules. The work starts from SAT Competition 2024 codebases and benchmarks and iteratively improves solvers.

Result: The evolved solvers decisively outperformed the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025 and also beat both 2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Repository-scale, self-improving LLM-based code evolution is feasible and highly effective for complex software domains, suggesting a promising direction for automated software evolution and optimization across large codebases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

### [90] [Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07414)
*Jakub Grudzien Kuba,Mengting Gu,Qi Ma,Yuandong Tian,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-play reinforcement learning framework for LLMs (Language Self-Play) enables improvements without additional data by letting models compete against themselves; experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct show self-play can surpass data-driven baselines on instruction-following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of LLMs is bottlenecked by the need for ever more high-quality data. Reducing or removing data dependencies could enable continued improvement.

Method: Introduce Language Self-Play (LSP), a game-theoretic self-play framework where a model’s capabilities are expressed as performance in a competitive game; stronger policies emerge by playing against the model itself, with RL guiding improvement; evaluated on instruction-following benchmarks using Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Result: Pretrained models can improve on challenging tasks via self-play alone, and with LSP they outperform data-driven baselines on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: LSP provides a data-free path to improve LLM capabilities, demonstrating the viability of self-play as a scalable mechanism for continual enhancement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

*Qin Chen,Yuanyi Ren,Xiaojun Ma,Mugeng Liu,Han Shi,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SheetDesigner is a zero-shot, training-free framework that uses Multimodal LLMs to automate spreadsheet layout by combining rule-based and vision-reflection strategies for placement and content population, achieving significant gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets have grid-like, discrete layouts and interrelated semantics (data dependencies, links) that current automated layout models fail to capture; there is a need for automated, data-centric spreadsheet layout design; authors formalize the task, develop a seven-criterion evaluation protocol, and assemble a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets.

Method: Proposes SheetDesigner, a zero-shot/training-free framework that leverages Multimodal LLMs with rule-based constraints and vision-reflection for component placement and content population; evaluated on 3,326 spreadsheets using a seven-criterion protocol.

Result: SheetDesigner outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6%. Vision modality helps handle overlap and balance but struggles with alignment, indicating the need for a hybrid rule and visual reflection strategy.

Conclusion: Hybrid rule- and vision-based reflection with MLLMs is effective for spreadsheet layout; formalizes the task and provides a practical, training-free solution; datasets and code are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL improves scalability and predictive accuracy in System Dynamics for transportation/logistics but typically sacrifices explainability and causal reliability, which are essential for critical decision-making in cyber-physical systems.

Method: A hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that operates on semantically meaningful, actionable variables, combining Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning to retain causal grounding and transparency in neural SD models; intended to be applied to real-world AutoMoTIF case studies for data-driven decision support and optimization of multimodal terminals.

Result: Proposes a framework and methodology to demonstrate interpretability and causal reliability in neural SD models; no empirical results are presented in the abstract, but case-study demonstrations are planned under AutoMoTIF.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic, interpretable-by-design approaches can bridge the gap between black-box DL models and the need for transparent, causally grounded decision support in complex cyber-physical logistics systems enabled by IIoT.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

*Minghui Li,Hao Zhang,Yechao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,pei Xiaobing,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an activations-guided, gradient-free DPI attack for LLMs using an energy-based model (EBM) built from surrogate activations and token-level MCMC to optimize adversarial prompts, yielding strong cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: White/gray-box DPI methods are impractical and black-box prompts have poor transferability; need a probe that is gradient-free and transferable across models, applicable to unseen tasks.

Method: Train an energy-based model on activations from a surrogate model to score prompt quality; perform token-level MCMC guided by the EBM to optimize prompts without gradients, enabling black-box attacks.

Result: Attains 49.6% attack success rate across five mainstream LLMs; 34.6% improvement over human-crafted prompts; 36.6% ASR on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Activation signals correlate with attack effectiveness; semantic patterns drive transferable vulnerability; the framework enhances DPI effectiveness and transferability, underscoring security risks and need for defenses.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

TL;DR: Proposes LLM ATLAS, a theory-based alignment strategy for organizational LLM adoption using agency theory; provides a literature-analysis framework and an initial alignment problem-solution space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful/off-topic content; organizational adoption involves information asymmetries due to black-box models; existing AI-alignment work overlooks organizational adoption dynamics and governance.

Method: Conceptual literature analysis anchored in agency theory and organizational LLM adoption phases; yields an extended literature-analysis process and an initial LLM alignment problem-solution space.

Result: Two deliverables: (1) extended literature analysis process for AI alignment in organizational LLM adoption; (2) first LLM alignment problem-solution space.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS provides a theoretically grounded framework to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption by aligning incentives, information flows, and governance.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

*Adem Kikaj,Giuseppe Marra,Floris Geerts,Robin Manhaeve,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates to enable multi-layer neurosymbolic reasoning on graphs, addressing the fixed flow limitation of prior systems like DeepProbLog and demonstrating effectiveness on planning and knowledge graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the rigid neural-to-symbolic pipeline that limits modeling complex dependencies, especially in graph-structured data; enable arbitrary-order layering of neural and symbolic components and process symbolic representations as graphs using GNNs.

Method: Introduce Graph Neural Predicates within ProbLog, treating symbolic representations as graphs and processing them with Graph Neural Networks to support multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning in arbitrary orders; evaluate on planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN expressivity.

Result: Empirical results show DeepGraphLog captures complex relational dependencies and overcomes limitations of existing NeSy systems, outperforming fixed-flow approaches and enabling effective graph-structured NeSy.

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog broadens neurosymbolic AI to graph-structured domains, providing a more expressive and flexible framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

*Jipeng Li,Zeyu Gao,Yubin Qi,Hande Dong,Weijian Chen,Qiang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-fold framework (FTR and LTM) enhances LLM reliability by regenerating outputs only after negative feedback and exploring multiple reasoning paths through delayed evaluation; yielding significant gains on math and code tasks over prompt-based self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-correction in LLMs is stymied by lack of reliable error localization and shallow reasoning caused by next-token-only decoding; need mechanisms to localize errors and expand reasoning depth.

Method: Introduce Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (regenerate only when user signals errors) plus Long-Term Multipath decoding (delayed evaluation to pursue multiple reasoning trajectories). Evaluate on math reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

Result: Shows consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks.

Conclusion: FTR and LTM effectively address error localization and shallow reasoning, improving reliability and depth of LLMs; promising direction for robust auto-correction in complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Motivation: Bridge gap between advanced NLP-enabled decision support (RAG) and interoperable clinical data (FHIR) to enhance evidence-based recommendations; address lack of practical applications.

Method: Conceptual system design proposing integration of HL7 FHIR resources with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to generate personalized clinical guidance aligned with evidence-based guidelines; outlines architecture and a research agenda without empirical evaluation.

Result: A conceptual framework and rationale; not empirically evaluated; proposes expected improvements in decision support.

Conclusion: Integrating RAG with FHIR is a promising direction for evidence-based clinical decision support, but requires substantial further work to evaluate practicality, deployment, and efficacy.

Abstract: In this study, we propose FHIR-RAG-MEDS system that aims to integrate Health
Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system to improve personalized
medical decision support on evidence-based clinical guidelines, emphasizing the
need for research in practical applications. In the evolving landscape of
medical decision support systems, integrating advanced technologies such as RAG
and HL7 FHIR can significantly enhance clinical decision-making processes.
Despite the potential of these technologies, there is limited research on their
integration in practical applications.

*Ziye Chen,Chengwei Qin,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO introduces a two-track, noise-free Olympiad benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM mathematical reasoning: RIMO-N with 335 single-answer problems and RIMO-P with 456 proof problems decomposed for automated grading. Ten frontier LLMs show sharp performance drops compared to older benchmarks, highlighting a large reasoning gap and offering a precise yardstick for progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Olympiad benchmarks suffer from grading noise and bias due to heterogeneous answer formats and flawed solutions, making it hard to gauge true reasoning ability. A high-difficulty, noise-free benchmark is needed to push and accurately measure LLM capabilities in Olympiad-style problem solving.

Method: RIMO consists of two tracks: (1) RIMO-N rewrites 335 IMO problems to have a unique integer answer, enabling deterministic correctness checks; (2) RIMO-P collects 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, decomposed into sub-problems for evaluating step-by-step reasoning via automated grading.

Result: Evaluations on ten frontier LLMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash) show strong performance on older benchmarks but a sharp drop on RIMO, indicating a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and true Olympiad-level reasoning.

Conclusion: RIMO provides a challenging yet easy-to-evaluate benchmark that serves as a high-resolution metric for advancing research in mathematical reasoning for LLMs and helps identify and close the substantial reasoning gap toward Olympiad-level competency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A BDPM pipeline for Parkinson's disease classification from gut microbiota; introduces RFRE feature selection and a hybrid classifier to handle temporal/spatial microbiome patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease misdiagnosis remains high due to reliance on clinical scales; gut microbiota show promise as biomarkers; current deep learning approaches often use single classifiers and ignore inter-strain and temporal dynamics; need robust, interpretable feature extraction tailored to microbiome data.

Method: Collect gut microbiota profiles from 39 PD patients and healthy spouses; identify differentially abundant taxa; develop RFRE (Random Forest + Recursive Feature Elimination) incorporating ecological knowledge for interpretability; design a hybrid classifier to capture temporal and spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Result: Proposes a complete BDPM framework; demonstrates integration of differential taxa selection, RFRE feature extraction, and a hybrid classifier; no quantitative results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: BDPM provides a robust, interpretable feature extraction approach for microbiome-based PD classification and warrants further validation across larger cohorts.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

TL;DR: A knowledge-augmented AI-enabled LCA method and chatbot to estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food, addressing data opacity, with a live demo; highlights potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address opaque and fragmented supply-chain data that hinder accessible, accurate LCA of food products; provide user-friendly interpretation of emissions.

Method: Integrates advances in LCA and public databases with knowledge-augmented AI (including retrieval-augmented generation); develops a chatbot interface; demonstrates via live web demo with arbitrary items and follow-up questions.

Result: Proof-of-concept shows interactive exploration of carbon impact for composite meals; demonstrates relation to familiar activities; documents potential benefits and limitations, including database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations.

Conclusion: AI-assisted, accessible LCA approach shows promise for communicating environmental footprints but requires careful handling of data quality and AI reliability; further work needed to improve robustness and transparency.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) introduces a critic that probes its own reasoning and terminates once a confidence threshold is reached, improving accuracy while reducing token usage on LRLMs; shows stability across seeds and token savings on AIME tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the efficiency-reliability trade-off in large reasoning language models by using confidence as a signal to decide when to stop reasoning.

Method: A generator/discriminator-inspired loop where a critic evaluates the model's reasoning for confidence; adaptive termination if target certainty is met; extensive experiments on AIME2024/2025 with 64 seeds and token-savings analysis.

Result: Baseline accuracy improved with fewer tokens; reduced variance across seeds; better exam-like performance under penalty-based grading; millions of tokens saved; performance tunable via certainty thresholds.

Conclusion: Certainty is a powerful sufficiency signal that makes LRLMs more adaptive, trustworthy, and cost-efficient for practical deployment.

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: RAG-augmented LLMs in education show tradeoffs: vector-based RAG is cost-efficient for fast fact retrieval, while graph-based RAG (GraphRAG Global/Local) yields richer, pedagogy-aligned or high-accuracy responses, especially with structured or altered corpora. A dynamic routing framework that selects retrieval strategy per query can optimize fidelity and efficiency in classroom QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability of LLMs in classroom settings by grounding responses in external resources and to compare two accessible RAG paradigms under pedagogical constraints, addressing gaps in prior work that ignored educational context and deployment costs.

Method: Evaluate OpenAI Vector Search RAG and GraphRAG Global/Local on EduScopeQA (3,176 questions across subjects) covering factual and thematic queries; assess against a corpus of altered textbooks; measure accuracy, pedagogical quality, and resource usage; propose a dynamic branching routing framework to choose the best retrieval method per query.

Result: Vector-based RAG performs well for quick factual retrieval at low cost; GraphRAG Global provides pedagogically rich theme-based answers; GraphRAG Local achieves highest accuracy when corpus integrity is crucial with dense, altered textbooks; GraphRAG is 10–20x more resource-intensive; dynamic routing improves fidelity and efficiency by directing queries to the most suitable method.

Conclusion: For educators and system designers, implement a dynamic, query-aware routing framework that selects between vector-based and graph-based RAG to balance fidelity, pedagogy, and cost in classroom QA deployments.

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

### [103] [SCoder: Iterative Self-Distillation for Bootstrapping Small-Scale Data Synthesizers to Empower Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07858)
*Xinyu Zhang,Changzhi Zhou,Linmei Hu,Luhao Zhang,Xiancai Chen,Haomin Fu,Yang Yang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) can be bootstrap-enhanced via iterative self-distillation from proprietary samples to become strong code data synthesizers, enabling SCoder to outperform baselines while reducing dependence on proprietary LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and access constraints of proprietary instruction data for fine-tuning motivate using open-source LLMs to synthesize high-quality code instruction data.

Method: In each iteration, a small LLM is trained on a few superior data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs to bootstrap data synthesis. The data is diversified using multi-checkpoint sampling and multi-aspect scoring for initial data. Gradient-based influence estimation is used to filter the most influential samples. The synthesized code-instruction data is then used to fine-tune DeepSeek-Coder into SCoder, a family of code generation models.

Result: SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities, validating the effectiveness of iterative self-distillation and data-selection strategies.

Conclusion: Iterative self-distillation with strategic data selection can transform small open-source LLMs into powerful data synthesizers, lowering costs and dependency on proprietary LLMs while delivering strong code-generation performance (as demonstrated by SCoder).

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

### [104] [CP-Model-Zoo: A Natural Language Query System for Constraint Programming Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07867)
*Augustin Crespin,Ioannis Kostis,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A retrieval-based tutoring system for constraint programming (CP) that maps natural-language problem descriptions to expert-written CP models stored in a database, yielding high retrieval accuracy without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CP modeling is powerful but hard; non-experts struggle to choose and model CP problems. The dream is to translate natural-language descriptions into expert-level models, but labeled data and labeling are costly. CP-Model-Zoo aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A database of expert-written CP models is used. Given a user’s natural-language description, the system retrieves the closest matching model from the repository. It presents expert-validated models, avoiding the need for human data labeling. Evaluation involved users with varying levels of expertise and tested retrieval accuracy.

Result: The approach achieves excellent retrieval accuracy: the system correctly retrieves the intended expert model across descriptions authored by users with different expertise levels.

Conclusion: Retrieval-based CP tutoring is viable: CP-Model-Zoo lowers entry barriers to CP by reusing expert models and avoids labeling overhead. Future work could enhance matching, scalability, and integration with broader CP tooling.

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiPhO is a new multimodal benchmark for high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation, compiling 13 exams from 2024–2025, using official marking schemes, and medal-based human comparison across 30 models; results show open-source MLLMs lag, closed-source reasoning models perform best, indicating a gap to full marks and enabling direct human comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics benchmarks lack up-to-date coverage of real Olympiad problems and built-in, direct comparison to human contestants. HiPhO addresses this by providing a rigorously evaluated, multimodal, Olympiad-focused benchmark aligned with human exam standards.

Method: Assemble 13 exams from 2024–2025 international and regional physics Olympiads covering text and diagrams; apply official marking schemes to grade at answer and step levels; assign gold/silver/bronze medals using official thresholds; evaluate 30 state-of-the-art models across open-source MLLMs, open-source LLMs, and closed-source reasoning MLLMs; compare performances to human contestants.

Result: Open-source MLLMs mostly reach bronze or below; open-source LLMs show occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs achieve 6–12 gold medals; majority remain far from full marks, indicating a substantial gap to top students but showing strong capabilities in certain closed models.

Conclusion: HiPhO provides a rigorous, human-aligned, Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning; it is open-source and enables direct comparisons with human competitors, highlighting progress and remaining challenges and guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

### [106] [Probing the Preferences of a Language Model: Integrating Verbal and Behavioral Tests of AI Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07961)
*Valen Tagliabue,Leonard Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces paradigms to measure welfare in language models by comparing self-reported preferences with behavioral measures in a virtual task, finding partial, condition-dependent correlations but substantial methodological uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether welfare-like cognitive states can be empirically studied in language models and whether behavioral proxies align with stated preferences.

Method: Developed new experimental paradigms: verbal reports of model preferences; behavioral tasks in a virtual environment navigating and selecting conversation topics; manipulations of costs and rewards; tests consistency of responses to semantically equivalent prompts using a eudaimonic welfare scale.

Result: Observed mutual support between verbal and behavioral measures; reliable correlations between stated preferences and behavior across conditions; welfare proxy feasible in some models; variability across models and perturbations; uncertainty remains about measuring the welfare state.

Conclusion: Welfare measurement in language models is feasible in principle and promising, but requires further refinement and exploration due to model variability and conceptual ambiguity surrounding welfare states in AI.

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

### [107] [VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933)
*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION is a counterfactual-augmented, interpretable graph neural network framework for vulnerability detection that uses LLM-generated counterfactuals and graph-based interpretability to mitigate spurious correlations, achieving large gains on CWE-20 and releasing a real-counterfactual CWE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN-based vulnerability detectors suffer from data imbalance, label noise, and reliance on superficial code similarities that cause spurious correlations and poor generalization to unseen data.

Method: (1) Use prompts to an LLM to generate counterfactuals—minimal semantic changes with opposite vulnerability labels. (2) Train GNNs on paired code examples with opposite labels to discourage spurious cues. (3) Apply graph-based interpretability to identify and emphasize crucial statements for predictions while ignoring spurious ones. (4) Introduce metrics (intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, node score dependency). (5) Release CWE-20-CFA benchmark (27,556 functions) and provide interactive human-in-the-loop visualization.

Result: VISION substantially improves performance on CWE-20: overall accuracy 51.8% -> 97.8%; pairwise contrast accuracy 4.5% -> 95.8%; worst-group accuracy 0.7% -> 85.5%. Demonstrates reduced spurious learning and better generalization; benchmark CWE-20-CFA and metrics introduced.

Conclusion: VISION advances transparent, trustworthy AI-driven cybersecurity by mitigating spurious correlations, enabling robust, generalizable vulnerability detection, and providing interpretable tools and benchmarks for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Given a periodic placement of copies of a tromino (either L or I), we prove
co-RE-completeness (and hence undecidability) of deciding whether it can be
completed to a plane tiling. By contrast, the problem becomes decidable if the
initial placement is finite, or if the tile is a domino instead of a tromino
(in any dimension). As a consequence, tiling a given periodic subset of the
plane with a given tromino (L or I) is co-RE-complete.
  We also prove co-RE-completeness of tiling the entire plane with two
polyominoes (one of which is disconnected and the other of which has constant
size), and of tiling 3D space with two connected polycubes (one of which has
constant size). If we restrict to tiling by translation only (no rotation),
then we obtain co-RE-completeness with one more tile: two trominoes for a
periodic subset of 2D, three polyominoes for the 2D plane, and three connected
polycubes for 3D space.
  Along the way, we prove several new complexity and algorithmic results about
periodic (infinite) graphs. Notably, we prove that Periodic Planar
(1-in-)3SAT-3, 3DM, and Graph Orientation are co-RE-complete in 2D and
PSPACE-complete in 1D; we extend basic results in graph drawing to 2D periodic
graphs; and we give a polynomial-time algorithm for perfect matching in
bipartite periodic graphs.

### [109] [First Plan Then Evaluate: Use a Vectorized Motion Planner for Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07162)
*Martin Matak,Mohanraj Devendran Ashanti,Karl Van Wyk,Tucker Hermans*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A parallelized, evaluator-guided grasp planning framework that plans trajectories to multiple generated grasps in parallel using a vectorized planner, achieving higher success and efficiency than classic generator-evaluator-planner (GEP) and generalizing to new environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization-based grasping is accurate but slow and sensitive to initialization; GEP reduces computation but either sacrifices success probability by planning to low-ranked grasps or spends time with multiple trajectory optimizations. There is a need for faster, reliable grasp planning that maintains success likelihood estimation.

Method: Generate multiple grasp targets; plan trajectories to all targets in parallel with a vectorized motion planner; an evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of each resulting trajectory; execute the trajectory deemed most likely to succeed; the approach supports generalization to new objects and environments.

Result: Empirical results show improvements over the traditional GEP framework across various objects, generators, and planners; demonstrates real-world generalization to shelves and table heights; includes a project website.

Conclusion: Parallel trajectory planning with vectorized planning and a grasp-success evaluator yields higher success probability and efficiency, offering robust generalization to unseen settings.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

*Hassen Nigatu,Shi Gaokun,Li Jituo,Wang Jin,Lu Guodong,Howard Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Quantum-native framework leveraging a parameterized quantum circuit to learn forward kinematics and Grover's algorithm to search for optimal configurations, yielding up to 93x speedup over Nelder-Mead in 1-DoF/2-DoF and dual-arm manipulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-DoF robotic configuration spaces are computationally expensive to optimize with classical methods. By combining quantum machine learning for forward-modeling with Grover search, the approach offers quadratic speedups and a principled bridge between quantum computing and robotics.

Method: Train a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate the forward kinematics model; use it to construct an oracle that marks optimal configurations; apply Grover's algorithm for amplitude-augmented search over discrete configurations; evaluate on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm tasks; compare performance to classical optimizers such as Nelder-Mead.

Result: Demonstrates significant speedups, up to 93x over Nelder-Mead as dimensionality increases, across 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm scenarios; validates the viability of a quantum-native kin optimization framework.

Conclusion: Proposes a foundational framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover search for robotic kinematic optimization, enabling scalable quantum-robotics solutions and bridging quantum computing with complex robotics problems.

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

TL;DR: Dynamic Gap extends gap-based local planners to dynamic environments by tracking and propagating gaps over time and using pursuit guidance to generate collision-free trajectories, with strong benchmarks and real-world TurtleBot2 validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception-informed planners for dynamic obstacles rely on emergent robustness rather than formal analysis, creating a gap in guaranteed collision avoidance in dynamic settings.

Method: Identify polar free-space regions (gaps) and track their dynamics; propagate gaps into the future via gap propagation algorithms; generate local trajectories via pursuit guidance theory under ideal conditions; perform obstacle-centric ungap processing when no gaps exist; benchmark against classical and learned planners; validate on a TurtleBot2 platform with real-world experiments.

Result: Dynamic Gap outperforms all baselines across dynamic environments in simulations and demonstrates collision avoidance behavior in real-world TurtleBot2 experiments.

Conclusion: The work extends perception-informed gap-based planning to dynamic environments by introducing formal gap tracking, future propagation, and pursuit-guided trajectories, yielding robust, provably collision-free local planning under ideal conditions and practical validation.

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

TL;DR: A comprehensive simulation and field study of MUONS for off-road navigation shows near-perfect performance in simulation (0.98 success) and no field failures; identifies Bi-RRT expansion radius as the most influential parameter on planning time and path length; supports Monte Carlo campaigns for performance tuning and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, data-driven development and tuning of point-cloud-based navigation in challenging off-road environments, bridging simulation with real-world performance.

Method: Extensive Monte Carlo evaluation: 30,000 planning/navigation trials in simulation using three terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven path-planning parameters; statistical and correlation analyses; field tests to validate simulation results.

Result: MUONS achieved 0.98 success rate in simulation and zero failures in field tests; Bi-RRT expansion radius shows strongest correlation with planning time and traversed path length; parameter tuning variation correlates with performance across field tests; Monte Carlo campaigns beneficial for performance assessment and tuning.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven evaluation is effective for off-road navigation stack development; key parameter Bi-RRT radius; Monte Carlo campaigns provide reliable performance assessment and tuning guidance; field validation supports simulation findings.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation
stack, MUONS, for autonomous off-road navigation. Performance is characterized
by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual localization in urban scenes is hindered by textureless areas, drastic viewpoint changes, and drift. ALS offers a scalable prior map, but progress is limited by lack of diverse platforms, scalable ground-truth, and cross-platform validation for I2P methods.

Method: Create and release a large-scale dataset that fuses ground-level imagery from mobile-mapping systems with airborne laser scanning point clouds across Wuhan, Hong Kong, and San Francisco to enable ALS-assisted localization research.

Result: A new integrated dataset is introduced and made available, enabling cross-city ALS-based localization studies and evaluation of I2P algorithms on diverse, urban-scale data.

Conclusion: The dataset addresses major barriers to ALS-assisted visual localization—diversity, ground-truth, and cross-platform validation—and serves as a resource to advance scalable, accurate localization in urban environments.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Transformer-based explicit MPC (TransMPC) uses an encoder-only Transformer to predict full control sequences in real time by directly optimizing finite-horizon costs with random horizon sampling, enabling accurate control for complex dynamics with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional online MPC is computationally heavy; explicit MPC reduces online computation but often relies on simplified dynamics and costs, limiting accuracy for complex systems. There is a need for accurate, horizon-flexible, real-time control for complex dynamics.

Method: Formulate the MPC policy as an encoder-only Transformer with bidirectional self-attention to infer entire control sequences in a single forward pass, enabling variable horizons and low latency. Train via direct policy optimization that alternates sampling and learning, using random horizon sampling and a replay buffer to generate i.i.d. training samples. Optimize the true finite-horizon cost through automatic differentiation rather than imitation of precomputed trajectories.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments show improved solution accuracy, robustness across varying horizons, and lower inference latency compared with baseline methods.

Conclusion: TransMPC demonstrates that a Transformer-based explicit MPC with direct optimization can deliver accurate, horizon-flexible control sequences in real time for complex systems, suggesting broad applicability and potential future enhancements (e.g., stability guarantees, extension to other domains).

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

### [115] [Attention and Risk-Aware Decision Framework for Safe Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07412)
*Zhen Tian,Fujiang Yuan,Yangfan He,Qinghao Li,Changlin Chen,Huilin Chen,Tianxiang Xu,Jianyu Duan,Yanhong Peng,Zhihao Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Improved PPO with risk-aware mechanisms for autonomous driving yields better collision avoidance and training efficiency in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO faces poor training results and long-sequence inefficiency; model-based methods may fail in unseen events; need safety-aware RL for driving.

Method: Introduce a risk-aware mechanism to highlight high-risk areas; a risk-attention decision network with channel and spatial attention; a balanced reward function that adapts to surrounding vehicle density; and a safety-assisted mechanism to supervise and block risky actions in lane keeping and lane changing.

Result: Outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance; achieves higher peak rewards with shorter training time; reduces driving time spent in risky areas across multiple traffic-flow scenarios in simulation on a physical engine.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances safe, efficient learning for autonomous driving via reinforcement learning, showing promise for safer RL in complex driving environments; real-world validation and further study on generalization are warranted.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

*Yuhan Pang,Bingyi Xia,Zhe Zhang,Zhirui Sun,Peijia Xie,Bike Zhu,Wenjun Xu,Jiankun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimization-based Visual Servoing approach using active infrared markers and a disturbance-rejection observer to robustly dock trolleys in leader-follower robotic systems under diverse lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate docking is central to orderly trolley collection but difficult due to high precision demands, environmental disturbances, and nonholonomic constraints in vision-based systems.

Method: Formulates a Hybrid Visual Servoing problem that integrates nonholonomic kinematics and visibility constraints; uses active infrared markers to extract robust features across lighting; solves an optimization-based servoing control; includes an observer for disturbance rejection.

Result: Experimental validation across diverse environments demonstrates robustness and high docking accuracy; quantitative metrics confirm reliable docking performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers robust, precise docking for autonomous trolley collection and redistribution; it can improve efficiency and reduce costs; future work could explore scalability to multiple trolleys and additional disturbances.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

### [117] [Timing the Message: Language-Based Notifications for Time-Critical Assistive Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07438)
*Ya-Chuan Hsu,Jonathan DeCastro,Andrew Silva,Guy Rosman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A RL-based framework addresses the timeliness-informativeness trade-off in language-based assistive systems for time-critical tasks. It uses an augmented-state MDP and an offline taxonomy dataset to balance message timing and content, improving success rates by >40% over time-delay-ignoring baselines and revealing a key trade-off guiding future design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In time-critical settings (e.g., assistive driving), cues (alerts/haptics) can be fast but ambiguous; informative language can help, but current systems neglect timing (verbal duration, comprehension delay, follow-through). There is a crucial trade-off between speed and informativeness that affects outcomes.

Method: Modeling the problem as an augmented-state Markov Decision Process and solving with reinforcement learning, coupled with a generated offline taxonomy dataset to enable scalable data-driven policy learning. A pipeline generates taxonomy data to support scalable training and evaluation of timing-informative strategies.

Result: Empirical evaluation with synthetic humans shows >40% improvement in success rates compared with methods that ignore time delays, while achieving a balance between timeliness and informativeness.

Conclusion: Timing considerations are critical in time-critical human-AI communication. The proposed framework highlights a trade-off between speed and informativeness and offers a scalable approach to optimize communication strategies in assistive AI.

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Text2Touch uses large language model–generated rewards to enable rapid, real-time dexterous tactile manipulation, achieving superior performance in multi-axis in-hand rotation with a tactile-enabled hand and successful sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing is crucial for human-like dexterity and has been underexplored in LLM-driven reward design. The work prompts the integration of vision-based tactile data into reward shaping to enable scalable, rapid acquisition of dexterous skills in real robots.

Method: Prompt engineering scales to 70+ environment variables to craft rewards from an LLM. The approach uses vision-based tactile sensing for in-hand object rotation in palm-up and palm-down configurations, followed by sim-to-real distillation to transfer learned policies to a fully actuated four-fingered tactile hand.

Result: LLM-crafted rewards outperform a carefully tuned human-engineered baseline in rotation speed and stability. Rewards are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler, yet effective, and the policy transfers from simulation to a real tactile-enabled robot hand.

Conclusion: LLM-designed rewards can significantly shorten the time from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, enabling faster, more scalable multimodal robot learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and
scalable multimodal robot learning. Project website:

*Sven Kirchner,Nils Purschke,Ross Greer,Alois C. Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal pipeline DepthVision uses LiDAR-to-RGB synthesis and luminance-aware fusion to enable robust robot perception under degraded visual conditions without re-tuning vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics rely on visual input, which degrades under low light, motion blur, or occlusion. Relying solely on RGB can fail; there is a need for robust perception that leverages diverse sensors without retraining large models.

Method: Generate RGB images from sparse LiDAR using a conditional GAN with a refiner. Fuse these synthetic images with real RGB via LAMA (Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation), which dynamically blends modalities based on ambient lighting. The system is designed to be plug-and-play with frozen downstream VLMs and does not require fine-tuning. Evaluations span real and simulated data across multiple models/tasks, emphasizing safety-critical scenarios.

Result: DepthVision improves performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only baselines while maintaining compatibility with frozen VLMs. The LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis approach enhances robustness and reliability of robot perception in degraded environments.

Conclusion: LiDAR-driven RGB synthesis paired with luminance-aware fusion provides a practical route to robust multimodal perception for robotics, enabling trustworthy operation in real-world lighting variations without retraining large vision-language systems.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

### [120] [Safe and Non-Conservative Contingency Planning for Autonomous Vehicles via Online Learning-Based Reachable Set Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07464)
*Rui Yang,Lei Zheng,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time contingency trajectory optimization framework for autonomous vehicles that uses event-triggered online learning of human-driven vehicles' control intents to quantify multi-modal uncertainties and refine forward reachable sets (FRS). It enforces safety with FRS-based barrier constraints and solves the optimization via consensus ADMM, enabling adaptive, less-conservative, and safer planning under uncertain HV behavior, validated in high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving under dynamic and uncertain environments due to human-driven vehicles and perception errors. Existing planners are either overly conservative or brittle to sudden maneuvers, risking safety or efficiency. There is a need for planners that adapt to evolving uncertainties and maintain safety without excessive conservatism.

Method: Propose a real-time contingency trajectory optimization framework that (1) performs event-triggered online learning of HV control-intent sets to capture multi-modal HV uncertainties; (2) incrementally refines the forward reachable set (FRS); (3) enforces invariant safety via FRS-based barrier constraints within the contingency trajectory optimization; (4) solves the optimization efficiently using consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (5) adapts continuously to HV behaviors to preserve feasibility and safety.

Result: High-fidelity simulations across highway and urban scenarios and real-world experiments show improved driving efficiency and passenger comfort while maintaining safety under uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework achieves safe, feasible planning under uncertain HV behavior without resorting to excessive conservatism, by continuously updating uncertainty representations and enforcing safety through FRS-based barriers, with demonstrated practical relevance on simulations and real-world tests.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid deformable aerial robot enables compliant perching on humans by using a hybrid morphing design (unilateral flexible arm + pneumatic actuators) that is rigid in flight and soft while perching, with a pneumatic control system for safe grasping and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safe, energy-efficient human-interacting perching with deformable aerial robots and address flight stability challenges introduced by flexible arms.

Method: Design a hybrid morphing structure combining a unilateral flexible arm and pneumatic inflatable actuators to keep arms rigid during flight and soft during perching; develop a pneumatic control system with optimized pressure regulation, shock absorption, and adjustable grasping forces; analyze structural conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling remains valid; implement and test a prototype.

Result: Prototype demonstrates compliant perching maneuvers on humans and robust recovery after arm deformation due to thrust reductions; shows feasibility of human-associated perching with safety and energy considerations.

Conclusion: The work claims to be the first to achieve an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction and highlights potential for safe human–robot interaction along with avenues for further improvement in control and robustness.

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniMap is the first online mapping framework that jointly captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes in real time, using a 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation; it incorporates adaptive camera modeling, normal-constrained incremental fusion, and probabilistic fusion to achieve state-of-the-art rendering fidelity, geometry, and zero-shot semantics across diverse scenes, enabling downstream tasks like Q&A, editing, manipulation, and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic perception requires complete, real-time, and compact 3D representations. Existing methods typically cover only appearance, geometry, or semantics, and struggle with blur, inaccuracies, and ambiguities. A unified, online, multi-modal map would improve perception-driven tasks.

Method: A tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation for optical, geometric, and semantic attributes; adaptive camera modeling to mitigate motion blur and exposure; hybrid incremental representation with normal constraints; probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level semantic understanding; designed for real-time performance and compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniMap achieves superior rendering fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes; demonstrated applicability to multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation, and map-assisted navigation.

Conclusion: OmniMap is the first online mapping framework to simultaneously capture optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes in real time with a compact model, offering broad utility for robotic perception and downstream tasks. It lays groundwork for more integrated, real-time scene understanding, though practical deployment may hinge on scalability and dynamic-scene handling.

Abstract: Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,
requiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise
layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).
Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these
requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and
semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,
OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously
captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining
real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,
OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that
combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including
multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,

Motivation: Integrate positional encoding from computer graphics into ML-based collision detection to better capture high-frequency collision patterns and reduce computational cost.

Method: Incorporate positional encoding into the input features of a binary classifier for self-collision detection; use lightweight MLPs operating in a low-dimensional feature space; compare performance against traditional geometric methods (triangle-triangle intersection tests and BVHs) on mesh-based models.

Result: Positional encoding enhances classification accuracy by capturing high-frequency variations, enabling a more detailed representation of complex collision patterns; ML-based approaches with lightweight MLPs offer faster collision checking than conventional geometric methods.

Conclusion: Positional encoding is a beneficial integration for ML-based self-collision detection, with low-dimensional MLPs providing speed advantages over geometry-based checks; supports ML-driven collision detection as a viable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional
feature space, offer a faster alternative for collision checking than
traditional methods that rely on geometric approaches, such as
triangle-to-triangle intersection tests and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)

*Gavin Tao,Yinuo Wang,Jinzhao Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-driven cross-modal RL using SSD-Mamba2 backbone to enable efficient end-to-end motion control with long-horizon planning and better compute/memory efficiency, outperforming baselines in safety and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion-control RL controllers are either proprioception-only or rely on fusion backbones with poor compute/memory trade-offs. Recurrent models struggle with long-horizon credit assignment; Transformer-based fusion has quadratic token-cost. A scalable, efficient backbone is needed for unified perception-action policies across embodiments/tasks.

Method: Introduce SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that uses state-space duality to support recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Encode proprioceptive and exteroceptive observations into compact tokens and fuse with stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. Use selective state-space updates to preserve long-range dependencies with lower latency/memory than self-attention. Train end-to-end with curricula that randomize terrain/appearance and increase scene complexity; use a compact, state-centric reward balancing task progress, energy, and safety.

Result: Across diverse motion-control scenarios, the method surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions/falls), and sample efficiency, with faster convergence at the same compute budget.

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion control, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute.

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling in high-dimensional configuration spaces with multiple constraints is computationally expensive and often inefficient with traditional methods; improving sampling efficiency is key to faster, more reliable TAMP.

Method: Introduce RobKiNet, a kinema-informed neural network that performs end-to-end sampling within the Continuous Feasible Set under multiple configuration-space constraints, supported by an Optimization Expectation Model. The approach infuses kinematic knowledge to stabilize gradient optimization and enhance training efficiency.

Result: In 2-DOF validations, theory and visualization confirm efficiency gains; in a 9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot (AMMR), RobKiNet achieves superior whole-body and decoupled control for tasks such as battery disassembly, outperforming deep RL with training speed 74.29x faster and sampling accuracy up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% real-world task completion rate.

Conclusion: Infusing kinematic knowledge into neural sampling (RobKiNet) improves training efficiency and sampling quality for constrained configuration-space sampling in TAMP, offering a strong data-efficient alternative to DRL with proven real-world performance.

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29
times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task
completion rate in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Collaborative marsupial ground–aerial exploration system using graph-based planning and bandwidth-efficient map sharing; improves coverage and reduces data transmission; validated in simulation and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown environments with limited communication require efficient exploration. Leveraging complementary ground and aerial capabilities can increase coverage, especially in areas inaccessible to one platform.

Method: Uses a graph-based path planner to allocate exploration tasks between ground and air, deploying the aerial robot where its expected information gain is higher. Introduces a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven map compression that reconstructs resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical details; selective sharing of key data minimizes communication while enabling map fusion for collaborative planning.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show enhanced exploration efficiency and significantly reduced data transmission, with effective map integration enabling coordinated planning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and benefits of marsupial ground–aerial collaboration for large-scale exploration under communication constraints, with scalable data-sharing strategies.

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data

### [127] [Temporal Counterfactual Explanations of Behaviour Tree Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07674)
*Tamlin Love,Antonio Andriella,Guillem Alenyà*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to automatically generate causal counterfactual explanations for behavior trees by constructing and querying a causal model derived from the BT structure and domain knowledge, enabling diverse 'why' explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability is crucial for stakeholder trust in robotics, and behavior trees are a popular control framework; existing explainability methods for BTs lack causal, counterfactual explanations to address 'why' questions.

Method: Build a causal model from the structure of the behavior tree plus domain knowledge about state and BT nodes, then query and search this model to produce a diverse set of counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive 'why' questions.

Result: The approach can correctly explain the behavior of a wide range of behavior tree structures and states and can answer a broad set of causal queries.

Conclusion: This work advances transparent, understandable, and trustworthy robotic systems by providing causal counterfactual explanations for BT-driven behavior.

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

*Luis Diener,Jens Kalkkuhl,Markus Enzweiler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Doppler-augmented radar SLAM system for automated parking that fuses radar features with Doppler velocities in a robocentric formulation, enabling multi-radar fusion and information-based feature pruning to achieve centimeter-level ego-motion accuracy with online calibration and improved robustness over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parking demands precise ego-motion in tight spaces with nearby obstacles. Traditional IMU/encoder-based methods require calibration and can be costly. Radar offers robustness to adverse weather and potential for online calibration, motivating a radar-based SLAM solution.

Method: A robocentric radar SLAM framework that fuses feature positions and Doppler velocities for robust data association and filter convergence. The approach includes Doppler augmentation, support for multiple radars, and an information-based feature-pruning strategy to maintain informative features for reliable estimation.

Result: Experiments show centimeter-level ego-motion accuracy and improved robustness over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating suitability for automated parking scenarios.

Conclusion: The Doppler-augmented radar SLAM with online calibration and multi-radar support provides accurate and robust ego-motion estimation for automated parking in challenging conditions.

Abstract: We address ego-motion estimation for automated parking, where
centimeter-level accuracy is crucial due to tight spaces and nearby obstacles.
Traditional methods using inertial-measurement units and wheel encoders require
calibration, making them costly and time-consuming. To overcome this, we
propose a radar-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach
that leverages the robustness of radar to adverse weather and support for
online calibration. Our robocentric formulation fuses feature positions and
Doppler velocities for robust data association and filter convergence. Key
contributions include a Doppler-augmented radar SLAM method, multi-radar
support and an information-based feature-pruning strategy. Experiments
demonstrate high-accuracy localization and improved robustness over
state-of-the-art methods, meeting the demands of automated parking.

### [129] [Fault Tolerant Control of a Quadcopter using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07707)
*Muzaffar Habib,Adnan Maqsood,Adnan Fayyaz ud Din*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An RL-based quadcopter control framework aims to improve safety and robustness under in-flight single-propeller failure by comparing model-based DP and model-free DDPG, trained for large continuous state/action spaces, and validated via MATLAB simulations showing viability for fault-tolerant operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical need for robust quadcopter control in the presence of propeller failure to protect hardware and payload in mission-critical applications.

Method: Two RL approaches are explored: Dynamic Programming (DP) as a model-based method with convergence guarantees but high compute, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) as a model-free, faster-but-duration-constrained method. The authors modify both algorithms to handle large continuous state and action spaces and train controllers to maintain/achieve a desired altitude after an inflight propeller failure, with extensive MATLAB simulations across varied initial conditions.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate viability of the proposed framework. A comparative analysis highlights trade-offs: DP offers convergence guarantees at higher computational cost; DDPG enables faster computation but may face limits on solution duration. The work shows potential applicability to faulty aerial systems and underscores robustness of the RL-based approach.

Conclusion: The study presents a RL-based fault-tolerant control framework for quadcopters, with DP and DDPG offering complementary strengths. The approach shows promise for safety-critical, fault-tolerant flight, though computational demands and real-time deployment considerations warrant further investigation.

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

### [130] [Unlocking Stopped-Rotor Flight: Development and Validation of SPERO, a Novel UAV Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07812)
*Kristan Hilby,Ian Hunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPERO is a stop-rotor UAV that combines a flipping/latching wing, active center-of-pressure control, thrust-vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor layout, and an eleven-state controller to achieve the first stable bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight, and it provides a generalizable framework for stop-rotor design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve long-standing aerodynamic and stability conflicts in stop-rotor UAVs and enable efficient, bidirectional flight (VTOL and forward flight) for missions requiring equal time in both regimes.

Method: Introduce SPERO with a rotating central lifting surface that flips/locks, an active center-of-pressure mechanism, thrust-vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state machine flight controller that coordinates geometry changes and control reconfiguration, establishing a generalizable stop-rotor design and control framework.

Result: Demonstrates the first stable bidirectional transition between vertical takeoff/landing and forward flight, overcoming previous instability and efficiency barriers, and establishes a reusable design/control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs.

Conclusion: SPERO closes the practical gap for stop-rotor UAVs by delivering a workable architecture and control strategy, enabling efficient operation across flight regimes and providing a foundation for future stopped-rotor platforms.

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

### [131] [Programmable Locking Cells (PLC) for Modular Robots with High Stiffness Tunability and Morphological Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07916)
*Jianshu Zhou,Wei Chen,Junda Huang,Boyuan Liang,Yunhui Liu,Masayoshi Tomizuka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Modular programmable stiffness via Programmable Locking Cells (PLCs) enables discrete stiffness modulation using tendon-driven interlocked joints; scalable assemblies achieve spatially programmable stiffness, demonstrated by a variable-stiffness gripper and a pipe-traversing robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for rapid switching between compliant and rigid states in unstructured environments while maintaining modularity and scalability; existing solutions are often complex, power-hungry, or monolithic.

Method: Introduce PLCs, modular tendon-driven units with mechanically interlocked joints. Each unit switches between compliant and firm states through structural engagement driven by cable tension. Assemblies of PLCs create reconfigurable structures with spatially programmable stiffness. Validation via two prototypes: a variable-stiffness gripper and a pipe-traversing robot.

Result: Achieves up to 950% stiffness variation per unit and maintains high payload robustness in the firm state. Demonstrates adaptive grasping, in-hand manipulation, shape adaptability, and confined-environment navigation in the prototypes.

Conclusion: PLC is a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for programmable stiffness and motion, enabling reconfigurable morphology and task-adaptive interaction in robotic systems.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

### [132] [RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953)
*Zheyuan Hu,Robyn Wu,Naveen Enock,Jasmine Li,Riya Kadakia,Zackory Erickson,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaC adds human-in-the-loop recovery trajectories after imitation learning to broaden skills, boosting efficiency and robustness for long-horizon, contact-rich tasks; achieves 10x faster data collection and scales with the number of recovery maneuvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data-efficiency limits of expert demonstrations in robotic imitation, particularly for deformable, contact-rich, long-horizon tasks where pure imitation data underperforms.

Method: During policy rollouts, human operators intervene when failure is imminent, rewind to a familiar in-distribution state, and provide a corrective segment to complete the sub-task; the policy is subsequently fine-tuned on these recovery trajectories after imitation pre-training.

Result: RaC outperforms prior state-of-the-art on three real-world bimanual tasks (shirt hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing) and a simulated assembly task; achieves ~10× reduction in data collection time; policy performance scales linearly with the number of recovery maneuvers.

Conclusion: Incorporating recovery-oriented demonstrations via human interventions expands the robot’s repertoire, improving efficiency, robustness, and scalability for long-horizon, contact-rich tasks beyond standard imitation learning.

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

*Shunlei Li,Longsen Gao,Jiuwen Cao,Yingbai Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GF-VLA enables dual-arm robots to learn task-level policies from RGB-D human demos via graph-structured scene representations fused with language-conditioned transformers, achieving robust generalization across objects and layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trajectory-centric imitation struggles to generalize; need task-level reasoning directly from human demonstrations to handle varying objects, layouts, and configurations.

Method: Extract task-relevant cues using information theory to highlight hand-object and object-object interactions, build temporally ordered scene graphs, integrate with a language-conditioned transformer to output hierarchical behavior trees and Cartesian motion primitives, and employ a cross-arm allocation strategy for gripper assignment without explicit geometric modeling.

Result: High empirical performance: >95% graph accuracy, ~93% subtask segmentation; on dual-arm robot deployment, ~94% grasp reliability, ~89% placement accuracy, ~90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks; strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: GF-VLA provides a unified, interpretable, and robust framework for task-level planning and execution from human demonstrations, enabling robust, generalizable dual-arm manipulation with interpretable motion primitives.

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Torque-aware VLA models that integrate torque signals into vision-language-action systems; decoder-side torque adapters outperform encoder-side; predicting torque as an auxiliary task further improves results; validated on contact-rich manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack subtle physical feedback integration (torque) needed for assessing task success and enabling closed-loop control in manipulation tasks.

Method: Systematic design-space study evaluating strategies to incorporate torque signals into existing VLA architectures. Comparisons between inserting torque adapters in encoder vs decoder; introducing torque prediction as an auxiliary output; extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on contact-rich manipulation benchmarks.

Result: Decoder-adapter torque integration consistently outperforms encoder integration. Predicting torque as an auxiliary output yields additional performance gains by fostering physically grounded representations of interaction dynamics. Results supported by extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating torque signals into VLA models is beneficial. Placing torque adapters in the decoder and treating torque as an auxiliary prediction are effective design choices that improve task performance and the model's physical understanding of interactions.

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.

*Xueyi Wang,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable, individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for sleep-quality forecasting from wearables, combining multi-scale convs, RNN/attention, and source-free test-time adaptation; achieves state-of-the-art RMSE (0.216 with 3-day input, 1-day forecast) and offers explainability for sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep quality strongly affects well-being and requires accessible, reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. Existing models may lack interpretability and generalization to new users with sparse wearable data.

Method: A two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model: (1) multi-scale convolutional layers to capture spatial interactions among input features, (2) recurrent layers and attention to model long-term temporal dependencies, (3) a two-stage domain adaptation: stage 1 during training to reduce overfitting, and stage 2 source-free test-time adaptation to adapt to new users without labels. Experiments with input windows of 3/5/7/9/11 days and prediction windows of 1/3/5/7/9 days, compared against LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet.

Result: The model consistently outperforms baselines. Best RMSE of 0.216 for a 3-day input and 1-day forecast; 0.257 RMSE for a 3-day forecast window. Demonstrates strong performance for longer horizons and robustness with sparse wearable data; includes an explainability analysis showing feature influences.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearables, with practical applicability for preventive healthcare.

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

TL;DR: GSTBench benchmarks cross-dataset transferability of graph SSL and finds GraphMAE most transferable; highlights limited generalization of many SSL methods; supports pretrain-then-transfer paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in understanding how graph SSL generalizes across datasets, which is essential for scalable pretraining and foundation models in graphs.

Method: Pretrain on ogbn-papers100M; evaluate five SSL methods on diverse target graphs; standardized setup to isolate pretraining objectives; decouples architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols.

Result: Most SSL methods fail to transfer; some underperform random initializations; GraphMAE consistently improves transfer performance; analysis identifies factors behind transferability differences.

Conclusion: GSTBench provides a rigorous framework for transferable graph SSL, guiding future research toward robust pretraining for graph foundation models; code released.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes KGCM, a knowledge-guided cross-modal framework that fuses structured traffic data with human knowledge text to forecast demand, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic prediction largely relies on temporal data; incorporating human knowledge and experience can guide pattern discovery, improve accuracy and robustness, and help handle data sparsity or anomalies.

Method: Build a prior knowledge dataset from large language model outputs plus manual authoring. Develop KGCM with local and global adaptive graph networks, cross-modal feature fusion, and a reasoning-based dynamic update strategy to optimize graph parameters and features in a multimodal setting.

Result: Experimental results on multiple traffic datasets show that KGCM accurately predicts future demand and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Integrating textual human knowledge with structured traffic data via adaptive cross-modal graphs and a reasoning-driven update mechanism enhances traffic demand forecasting and model robustness, suggesting broader potential for multimodal intelligent transportation forecasting.

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dependable deployment of DL models across heterogeneous runtimes by systematically quantifying cross-backend drift and providing reproducible methodology.

Method: A YAML-decoupled, configuration-first framework that supports both library and repository models, and applies a three-tier verification protocol: tensor-level closeness, activation alignment, and task-level metrics. Evaluation involves 672 checks across models and tolerance settings. Introduces deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks to mitigate drift.

Result: Observed 72.0% pass rate across runs; most discrepancies arise under stricter thresholds. Drift is pronounced in detection models and compiled backends, often due to nondeterministic post-processing. Deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks substantially improve agreement with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: This work presents the first unified, reproducible framework to quantify and mitigate cross-backend drift in deep learning, enabling dependable deployment across CPU, GPU, and compiled runtimes.

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,

settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

### [139] [A Kriging-HDMR-based surrogate model with sample pool-free active learning strategy for reliability analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06978)
*Wenxiong Li,Hanyu Liao,Suiyin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An active-learning Kriging-HDMR surrogate for high-dimensional reliability analysis that decomposes the limit-state function into low-dimensional sub-surrogates with optimized, pool-free sample selection, achieving accurate predictions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability analysis suffers from the curse of dimensionality and typically prioritizes accuracy in critical regions rather than uniform accuracy; HDMR-based active learning offers a scalable approach to capture high-dimensional limit-state functions.

Method: A three-stage surrogate framework: (1) build single-variable sub-surrogates for all random variables; (2) identify requirements for coupling-variable sub-surrogate models; (3) construct coupling-variable sub-surrogate models. Optimization-based DOE selection is formulated for each stage, incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample location, and inter-sample distance. A pool-free candidate sampling approach selects informative samples.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional reliability problems.

Conclusion: The HDMR-based active-learning Kriging surrogate effectively focuses modeling effort on critical regions in high-dimensional reliability analysis, enabling accurate predictions with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional

### [140] [Exploring Over-stationarization in Deep Learning-based Bus/Tram Arrival Time Prediction: Analysis and Non-stationary Effect Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06979)
*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage NSATP method for multi-step arrival time prediction that preserves non-stationarity: stationarization then recovery. Shows modest improvements on Dresden data (trams/buses).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationarity in time series degrades multi-step ATP; normalization can over-stationarize and erase useful patterns. A method that balances predictability with retained non-stationarity is needed.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) stationarize the series to improve predictability; (2) recover non-stationarity effects by extending a 1D-based model to 2D to capture hidden periodicity and a compensation module learning scaling/shifting from raw data; validates on 125 days of Dresden public transport data, comparing to baselines.

Result: Compared to baselines, NSATP reduces RMSE, MAE, MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, 2.26% for trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, 1.17% for buses.

Conclusion: NSATP provides a better balance between predictability and preserving useful non-stationarity in multi-step ATP, yielding consistent improvements and highlighting the value of handling non-stationarity deliberately in transit time prediction.

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a

### [142] [CARE: Decoding Time Safety Alignment via Rollback and Introspection Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06982)
*Xiaomeng Hu,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARE proposes a decoding-time safety alignment framework combining a guard model, token-buffer rollback, and introspection-based self-correction to improve safety without harming output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe model outputs during decoding is critical; existing techniques trade safety for quality; a better balance is needed for real-world deployment.

Method: Three components: (1) real-time guard model for safety monitoring, (2) rollback with a token buffer to correct unsafe outputs early, (3) introspection-based intervention where the model critiques its own outputs and feeds reflections back into context for subsequent decoding.

Result: Empirical results show improved safety-quality-efficiency trade-offs: lower harmful response rate, minimal user disruption, and preserved high response quality.

Conclusion: Integrating guarded monitoring, rollback, and introspective self-correction yields effective decoding-time safety alignment with favorable performance and potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

*Lishan Yang,Nam Kha Nguygen,Po Hu,Wei Emma Zhang,Yanjun Shu,Mong Yuan Sim,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FediLoRA enables federated multimodal fine-tuning with heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities by dimension-wise aggregation and layer-wise model editing, outperforming baselines on multimodal benchmarks in global and personalized settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are large; deploying in decentralized/federated environments is challenging due to resource heterogeneity and incomplete multimodal data. Existing federated LoRA methods assume uniform ranks and full modalities, limiting practicality.

Method: Propose FediLoRA. Use dimension-wise aggregation to reweight LoRA updates to avoid information dilution during aggregation; a lightweight layer-wise editing to selectively incorporate global parameters to repair local components; supports heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities.

Result: Experimental results on three multimodal benchmarks show superior performance versus competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, with notable gains under modality incompleteness.

Conclusion: FediLoRA provides effective federated multimodal fine-tuning under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities, improving client and global performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

### [144] [Machine Generalize Learning in Agent-Based Models: Going Beyond Surrogate Models for Calibration in ABMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07013)
*Sima Najafzadehkhoei,George Vega Yon,Bernardo Modenesi,Derek S. Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A supervised LSTM-based calibrator learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters, outperforming ABC in accuracy and speed, with an epidemiology-consistency loss; applied to epiworldR in R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally expensive and data-limited; a fast, accurate inverse-mapping approach is needed to map observed time series to model parameters, enabling practical use of ABMs.

Method: Use a three-layer bidirectional LSTM that takes 60-day incidence, population size, and recovery rate as input and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Train with a composite loss that includes an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty enforcing R0 * recovery_rate ≈ transmission * contact. Evaluate on 1000 simulated scenarios, comparing against Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). Data are SIR ABMs generated with epiworldR; implementation provided in R.

Result: The ML calibrator achieves lower error than ABC across all targets: MAE(R0) = 0.0616 vs 0.275; MAE(transmission) = 0.0715 vs 0.128; MAE(contact) = 1.02 vs 4.24. It produces tighter predictive intervals with near-nominal coverage and dramatically reduces wall-clock time per calibration (77.4 s → 2.35 s). Even with partial nonidentifiability of contact rate and transmission probability, it reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC.

Conclusion: A supervised ML calibrator provides faster, more accurate calibration for agent-based epidemic models than ABC, facilitating practical use. The approach yields faithful epidemic reconstructions and is implemented in R (epiworldR).

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

*Xinquan Wu,Xuefeng Yan,Mingqiang Wei,Donghai Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a simple discrete-event DRL environment for FJSP and an end-to-end PPO-based scheduler with a minimal 2-variable state and an area-based reward; shows improved PDR performance and competitive results vs OR-Tools, meta-heuristics, DRL, and PDR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FJSP is challenging; DRL scheduling methods largely neglect environment modeling, hindering learning efficiency and performance; a simple, well-designed environment can boost DRL performance and provide fair comparisons.

Method: Construct a chronological DRL environment using discrete-event simulation; develop an end-to-end PPO-based DRL scheduler; introduce a compact state representation based on two scheduling environment variables; design reward based on machine-area; evaluate on public benchmarks; compare with PDR baselines, OR-Tools, meta-heuristics, DRL methods.

Result: In experiments, plain PDRs perform better in the new environment than in conventional ones; the proposed DRL scheduler achieves competitive performance against strong baselines including OR-Tools, meta-heuristics, DRL, and PDR.

Conclusion: A simple, well-aligned DRL environment and a PPO-based scheduling model can improve classical heuristics and deliver competitive scheduling quality for FJSP; environment design is critical for DRL success.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

*Eduardo Lobo Lustoda Cabral,Paulo Pirozelli,Larissa Driemeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel one-bit parameter neural network framework using binary normalized layers across various layer types, achieving near parity with 32-bit networks on image classification and language decoding while using 32x less memory, enabling deployment on standard hardware without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large neural networks (e.g., language models, foundational image models) are memory- and compute-intensive. Reducing memory requirements while preserving performance is critical for practical deployment across devices like mobile phones and CPUs.

Method: Introduce binary normalized layers where all parameters are 0 or 1, applicable to various layer types (fully connected, convolutional, attention). Build models for image classification (CNN components) and language decoding (transformer blocks with multi-head attention), using 1-bit arrays without requiring dedicated hardware.

Result: Experiments show performance close to equivalent 32-bit models, with about 32x memory reduction. Implementation is feasible on conventional hardware without specialized electronics.

Conclusion: Binary normalized layers enable a new, memory-efficient era for large neural networks, facilitating deployment on cheap hardware (mobile, CPU) and simplifying hardware requirements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

### [147] [Recursive State Inference for Linear PASFA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07028)
*Vishal Rishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a recursive MMSE estimator for slow features in Probabilistic Adaptive Slow Feature Analysis (PASFA) modeled as an ARMA process; enables recovering original slow features from observations without full ARMA-to-state-space transforms; validated on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently infer slow-varying features (slow features) from observations in probabilistic SFA/PASFA, addressing limitations of Kalman-filter-based inference that requires ARMA-to-state-space transformation and does not recover the original slow features.

Method: Develop a recursive extension to linear PASFA that performs MMSE estimation of the ARMA latent states given observations and the model, operating directly on the ARMA formulation rather than transforming it to a conventional state-space form.

Result: Demonstrates the correctness of the proposed MMSE estimator on a synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: The recursive PASFA/MMSE framework provides an effective approach to infer and recover slow features from data; further evaluation on real datasets and comparisons with Kalman-filter based methods are warranted.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

### [148] [A Minimalist Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07030)
*Kaizheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A minimalist Bayesian framework that places priors only on the component of interest and uses profile likelihood to eliminate nuisance parameters; introduces MINTS (MINimalist Thompson Sampling); demonstrates applicability to structured problems (continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits, dynamic pricing) and shows a probabilistic link to convex optimization methods; provides near-optimal regret guarantees for MINTS in multi-armed bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable principled Bayesian decision-making under uncertainty while respecting structural constraints and reducing modeling burden by not placing priors on nuisance parameters.

Method: Specify prior only for the target parameter; remove nuisance via profile likelihood; instantiate MINTS for Thompson Sampling; apply to structured problems (continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits, dynamic pricing); connect to center of gravity and ellipsoid methods; analyze regret in MAB.

Result: MINTS achieves near-optimal regret for MAB; the framework accommodates structured problems and yields a probabilistic interpretation of classical optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that minimalist Bayesian modeling with nuisance parameter elimination can effectively handle structured sequential decision problems, offering flexibility, interpretability, and strong performance guarantees.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

*Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines causal discovery (LPCMCI with GPDC) and uncertainty-aware forecasting (Chronos LLM) on macro data (1970–2021) to reveal GDP growth causality, limited inflation connectivity, autoregressive unemployment, and accurate 1–2 quarter forecasts with 90% prediction intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrate causal structure learning with probabilistic forecasting in economics to improve policy insight and forecast robustness, leveraging recent advances in LPCMCI/GPDC and large language models specialized for time series.

Method: Apply LPCMCI with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to quarterly U.S. macro indicators (GDP, economic growth, inflation, unemployment) from 1970–2021 to uncover dynamic causal networks; analyze unemployment with Chronos for zero-shot probabilistic forecasting and 90% intervals; assess anomaly detection via deviation analysis.

Result: Found a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP; limited connectivity of inflation suggesting latent factors; unemployment shows strong autoregressive dependence; Chronos yields accurate 1- and 2-quarter-ahead forecasts with 90% confidence intervals enabling principled anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Demonstrates value in jointly using causal structure learning and probabilistic language-model forecasts to inform economic policy and increase forecast robustness through uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Swin Transformer outperforms CNNs in thermal PV fault detection and, with XRAI-based physics-guided interpretability, shows that models learn thermally meaningful features; performance varies by fault type, highlighting resolution limits for challenging cases like soiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability barriers for AI in PV monitoring by validating that model decisions align with thermal physics, enabling safer deployment in energy infrastructure.

Method: Systematic comparison of CNNs (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) using XRAI saliency analysis on 20,000 infrared images across normal operation and 11 fault categories.

Result: Swin-Tiny achieves the highest metrics (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass). XRAI reveals alignment with physical signatures (hotspots for defects, linear paths for diodes, boundaries for shading). Electrical faults detected well (F1>0.90); environmental factors like soiling are challenging (F1 0.20–0.33).

Conclusion: Introduces a physics-guided interpretability approach to validate AI decisions in thermal PV fault detection and demonstrates a first systematic CNN vs ViT comparison, highlighting both promise and limitations for deployment in energy monitoring.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

*Sergey Pozdnyakov,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: lmKANs replace high-dimensional linear mappings with trainable low-dimensional multivariate spline lookup tables, delivering large inference-cost savings while preserving modeling capacity; demonstrated across fully connected and CNN benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k) and methane dataset; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional linear layers dominate parameter counts and compute in modern networks; there is a need for representations that reduce FLOPs without sacrificing expressivity.

Method: Introduce lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs) as a drop-in replacement for linear layers. A high-dimensional mapping is expressed via trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions implemented as spline lookup tables, allowing many parameters per function but only a few multiplications per computation.

Result: Inference FLOPs reduced by up to 6× in fully connected benchmarks; >10× higher H100 throughput on a methane configuration dataset at equal accuracy; in CNNs, lmKANs achieve 1.6–2.1× FLOPs reduction at matched accuracy and about 1.7× on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: lmKANs offer a general, practical drop-in replacement for high-dimensional linear mappings with a favorable capacity-cost trade-off, enabling substantial inference-speedups across diverse architectures; code (CUDA kernels) is available online.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: Introduces GyroBN, a principled batch normalization for gyrogroups on Riemannian manifolds, with two necessary conditions (pseudo-reduction and gyroisometric gyrations) to control statistics, unifying existing Riemannian normalization methods and enabling instantiations across seven geometries, with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean batch normalization is inadequate for data on manifolds; existing Riemannian normalization methods lack principled, generalizable frameworks for gyrogroups. GyroBN aims to provide theoretical guarantees and a unified approach across non-Euclidean domains commonly used in ML.

Method: Propose two necessary conditions—pseudo-reduction and gyroisometric gyrations—that ensure controlled statistics in GyroBN; prove these hold for known gyrogroups; show GyroBN subsumes existing normalization methods as special cases; instantiate GyroBN on seven geometries (Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and correlation manifold) by deriving new gyro/Riemannian structures; provide an implementation and experimental validation across geometries.

Result: The framework yields a consistent normalization mechanism on gyrogroups with theoretical guarantees; it unifies several existing Riemannian normalization methods and demonstrates effectiveness through experiments across diverse geometries; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: GyroBN offers a principled, theory-backed batch normalization for non-Euclidean data on gyrogroups, broadening the applicability of normalization in geometric ML and enabling practical deployment across multiple Riemannian manifolds.

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

*Adrian Hayler,Xingyue Huang,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Ben Finkelshtein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabGFM reframes node classification as a tabular task using tabular foundation models; constructs tables from graphs via feature and structure encoders; uses diverse TFMs on subsampled tables and ensembles outputs; achieves improvements over GNNs and GFMs on 28 real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFMs often underperform due to training on non-representative graphs; TFMs excel on tabular data and cross-domain tasks. Reformulating graphs as tables could enable scalable, generalizable learning and zero-shot node classification via in-context learning.

Method: Convert each node into a table row with features, structural encodings, and labels. Use feature and structural encoders to transform graph to tabular form. Apply multiple TFMs on variably subsampled tables. Aggregate outputs via ensemble selection for final prediction. Enable zero-shot node classification via in-context learning.

Result: TabGFM yields consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs across 28 real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of tabular reformulation for scalable, generalizable graph learning.

Conclusion: Tabular reformulation with TabGFM shows promise for broad generalization in graph learning, leveraging TFMs for zero-shot classification and robust performance; encourages exploration of tabular perspectives in graph AI.

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

### [154] [Measuring Uncertainty in Transformer Circuits with Effective Information Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07149)
*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS) to quantify coherent, trustworthy activity in Transformer Circuits using a white-box, single-pass metric built from sheaf inconsistency and causal emergence proxies; provides interpretation guidance and overhead analysis; empirical validation on LLM tasks is deferred.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no formal, single-pass metric to quantify when an active Transformer Circuit is behaving coherently and thus trustworthy; a formal, systems-theoretic, explainable score is needed to assess circuit coherence.

Method: Integrates (i) normalized sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, and (ii) a Gaussian effective-information proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the forward state; the approach is white-box, single-pass, with explicit units; includes fast/exact modes and toy sanity checks.

Result: Proposes the EICS construction, provides interpretation guidance and computational overhead analysis; demonstrates feasibility with toy analyses; empirical validation on LLM tasks is left for future work.

Conclusion: EICS yields a dimensionless, interpretable measure of coherence/trustworthiness of active Transformer Circuits; serves as a practical, theory-grounded tool, though its empirical utility remains to be demonstrated.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

*Andy Xu,Rohan Desai,Larry Wang,Gabriel Hope,Ethan Ritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLaID++ fine-tunes an LLM (Qwen-2.5 7B) with a Wyckoff-based text representation and Direct Preference Optimization to generate thermodynamically stable, unique crystal structures, optionally guided to specific space groups, achieving substantial gains over fine-tuning alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate discovery of novel materials by replacing slow trial-and-error crystallography with an AI-assisted generation pipeline that respects symmetry and chemical space constraints.

Method: Fine-tune Qwen-2.5 7B on Wyckoff-based crystal text; apply Direct Preference Optimization reinforcement learning using sampled structures labeled by stability, novelty, and space group; encode symmetry constraints in text to guide outputs; iterative DPO improves unconditional and space-group conditioned generation.

Result: Generated structures are more stable, unique, and novel, with ~50% higher generation rate than prior methods and conditional improvements of ~115% (unconditional) and ~50% (space-group conditioned) over baseline fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Shows the viability of transferring NLP post-training techniques to materials discovery, enabling targeted and efficient exploration of chemical space for crystal materials.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

*Yiyue Chen,Usman Akram,Chianing Wang,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-REACT enhances federated learning under heterogeneous and evolving client data by combining local representation learning with dynamic, cluster-wise training of task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high resource costs and privacy concerns of centralized ML and to mitigate performance degradation in FL caused by non-iid and evolving client data distributions.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) each client learns local feature representations; (2) the server uses these representations to dynamically cluster clients (via evolutionary clustering) and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream objectives.

Result: The paper provides theoretical analysis of the representation-learning stage and shows empirically that Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Clustering clients by learned representations and training cluster-specific models improves FL performance under heterogeneous and evolving data, with theoretical support and empirical validation.

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

*Adrien Couetoux,Thomas Devenyns,Lise Diagne,David Champagne,Pierre-Yves Mousset,Chris Anagnostopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular ML framework predicts efficacy of untested drugs by leveraging pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, validating on real-world data with unseen treatments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of forecasting a drug's efficacy before clinical testing by integrating pathway-level drug impact with patient characteristics and outcomes, enabling generalization to unseen treatments.

Method: Train a machine learning model using sets of pharmaceutical–pathway weight impact scores and patient data. The model analyzes weighted pathway scores of an untested pharmaceutical across human molecule–protein pathways to predict efficacy. The study uses real-world treatment/outcome data and two weight-impact score algorithms, and includes evaluation of generalization to unseen treatments and conditions under which predictions are most reliable.

Result: Applied to a real-world dataset with patient treatments and outcomes, showing that the approach can generate a predicted efficacy value and provide insights into when it generalizes well, with two weight-score algorithms offering comparable or complementary performance.

Conclusion: An initial, modular framework for predicting effects of untested drugs, with room for iteration and enhancement, especially through richer real-world data, drug embeddings, and more robust generalization analyses.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

### [158] [Explaining How Quantization Disparately Skews a Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07222)
*Abhimanyu Bellam,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization-induced disparities across groups arise from cascaded changes to weights and activations during forward/backward passes; mixed-precision QAT with dataset sampling and weighted loss can mitigate for fair deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness concerns in post-training quantization (PTQ) and its adverse effects on minority groups; provide a mechanistic understanding of why group disparities arise and offer practical mitigation.

Method: Analytical study of how weight and activation quantization perturb forward and backward computations, examining effects on logits variance, loss, and group accuracies; investigation of group gradient norms and Hessian eigenvalues to understand optimization dynamics; proposal to integrate mixed-precision Quantization Aware Training (QAT) with dataset sampling and weighted loss.

Result: The study identifies a cascade of quantization-induced effects that reduce logits variance and elevate loss for some groups, links these to changes in gradient norms and Hessian structure, and proposes a mitigated approach using mixed-precision QAT with sampling and weighted loss to enable fair deployment.

Conclusion: Integrating mixed-precision QAT with dataset sampling and weighted loss offers a practical path to fair, robust deployment of quantized neural networks; the approach aims to reduce disparate impact while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

TL;DR: A comprehensive, production-oriented optimization study of fine-tuning parameters for five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving significant efficiency gains and high accuracy with universal configuration trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost and speed up inference for mathematical reasoning by systematically exploring hyperparameters across multiple models and distilling universal optimization patterns for deployment.

Method: Systematic search over temperature, reasoning steps, planning periods, and nucleus sampling; evaluated on multiple math reasoning benchmarks across five models: Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, Yi-Lightning; measured accuracy, tokens per correct response, and inference speed; identified optimal configurations.

Result: Average 29.4% drop in computational cost, 23.9% faster inference; 100% optimization success rate; DeepSeek-V3 reached 98% accuracy; Mixtral-8x22B had best cost-efficiency at 361.5 tokens per accurate response; lower temperature (0.1-0.4) and fewer reasoning steps (4-6) yielded best efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: First comprehensive, production-ready optimization framework for diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning; reveals universal optimization trends; enables deployment-ready configurations with quantified performance gains.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a

*Shalev Manor,Mohammad Kohandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning IP-Basis PINNs builds offline PDE solution bases and online trains a small linear head for fast, robust inverse problem inference, delivering large multi-query speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems with PINNs are costly when solving many different data realizations; a basis-based offline learning can amortize cost and enable rapid online inference.

Method: Offline phase: train a network to produce a rich basis spanning the PDE solution space across parametric variations. Online phase: for a new inverse problem, freeze the network and train only a lightweight linear output layer to map basis coefficients to data; employ a joint online loss for reconstruction and parameter identification; use forward-mode automatic differentiation to compute PDE losses efficiently; apply validation and early stopping for offline training; extend to universal PINNs to handle unknown functional terms.

Result: Three benchmarks show consistent performance across constant and functional parameter estimation; substantial per-query speedups vs standard PINNs; robust to scarce and noisy data; extension to universal PINNs indicates unknown terms can be handled.

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs provide an effective, scalable framework for rapid, multi-query inverse PDE inference with robust accuracy, reduced compute, and flexibility to handle unknown terms.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient Conductor (GCond) is a scalable gradient conflict resolver for multi-task learning that extends PCGrad with gradient accumulation and an adaptive arbitration mechanism; it achieves about 2x speedups and improved task losses on ImageNet and CT scans, and scales from MobileNetV3-Small to ConvNeXt architectures, compatible with AdamW, Lion/LARS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient conflicts in multi-task learning (MTL) degrade optimization, and existing solutions like PCGrad, CAGrad, and GradNorm are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability to modern large models and transformers.

Method: GCond builds on PCGrad principles and adds gradient accumulation across mini-batches plus an adaptive arbitration mechanism to resolve conflicting gradients. It uses a stochastic mode to reduce computation, achieving a two-fold speedup while preserving optimization quality. It was evaluated on self-supervised tasks with MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt on ImageNet-1K and a combined head/neck CT scan dataset, comparing against linear baselines and state-of-the-art gradient conflict methods. It is compatible with optimizers such as AdamW and Lion/LARS.

Result: The stochastic mode of GCond achieved about a 2x computational speedup without sacrificing optimization quality and showed superior performance across evaluated metrics, including lower L1 and SSIM losses on both ImageNet-1K and the CT dataset. GCond demonstrated scalability to both compact models (MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny/Base). It also remained compatible with modern optimizers like AdamW and Lion/LARS.

Conclusion: GCond provides a scalable and efficient solution to gradient conflicts in multi-task learning, enabling practical training for modern large models without excessive computational overhead.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variational Bayesian framework to learn generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data in an unsupervised manner, using sparse symplectic random Fourier Gaussian processes, with ELBO data fidelity and physics-based regularization to handle conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems and provide bounded uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture diverse phase-space dynamics that a single Hamiltonian network cannot describe, especially under noisy, sparse observations, while ensuring physical consistency and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes to learn generalized Hamiltonian dynamics with a variational Bayesian approach. Use a generalized state-and-momentum Hamiltonian formulation for conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems. Optimize using kernelized ELBO for data fidelity plus hyperparameter-weighted stability and conservation constraints to regularize multi-gradients and enforce physics correctness.

Result: Qualitative: enhanced prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty and improved physics-consistency across conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian regimes; demonstrates robustness to noise and data sparsity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust unsupervised method for learning generalized Hamiltonian dynamics with physical constraints, enabling accurate, uncertainty-bounded predictions across diverse dynamical classes.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALICE, an encoder-only Transformer with a bijective decoding head using the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method for cryptogram decryption. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed, generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on ~1500 examples, and provides interpretable insights into how neural networks learn bijections, mirroring human strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study neural generalization in combinatorially complex domains and to develop interpretable models for bijective mappings, using cryptogram decryption as a challenging testbed.

Method: Propose ALICE, an encoder-only Transformer with a novel bijective decoding head that models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn distribution. Train on many cryptogram examples to predict the substitution mapping, and perform early exit analysis to inspect layerwise behavior; extract learned cipher mappings from the decoding head for interpretability.

Result: ALICE sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and speed on cryptogram decryption. It generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on roughly 1500 unique ciphers, a vanishingly small fraction of the total cipher space. The bijective decoding head enables direct extraction of the learned permutation mappings. Early-exit analysis shows a progression where early layers rely on frequency-based heuristics, middle layers capture word structures, and final layers refine individual characters, suggesting a human-like strategy.

Conclusion: The architectural innovations and interpretability techniques extend beyond cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure, offering new insights into neural generalization and interpretability in complex mapping tasks.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent is proposed to generate NCCN-guideline-concordant NSCLC treatment trajectories, supported by a novel 121-case annotated dataset, high-quality proxy benchmarks (r=0.88, RMSE=0.08), and a hybrid human–model approach including a meta-classifier with calibrated confidence (AUROC=0.800) to balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory needs; framework for scalable AI-assisted clinical decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-based treatment plans is time-consuming and error-prone. There is a need for AI-assisted systems that are accurate, interpretable, and compliant with regulatory standards to support clinicians in delivering guideline-adherent NSCLC care.

Method: 1) Build a longitudinal NSCLC dataset of 121 cases with expert NCCN guideline trajectories. 2) Demonstrate that existing LLMs can generate high-quality proxy benchmarks for model development/evaluation, achieving strong correlation with expert benchmarks. 3) Develop a hybrid approach combining costly human annotations with model-consistency signals to create: (a) an agent predicting relevant guidelines for a patient, and (b) a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores (AUROC=0.800).

Result: The approach yields high alignment with expert NCCN trajectories (Spearman r=0.88; RMSE=0.08) and a calibrated confidence mechanism (AUROC=0.800) for treatment recommendations, indicating feasibility of clinically viable, interpretable, and regulation-friendly LLM-guided decision support while reducing annotation costs.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline-adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements, offering a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support in oncology.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

### [165] [General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330)
*Li-Chin Chen,Ji-Tian Sheu,Yuh-Jue Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDP learns general latent representations for demographic attributes (age, gender) from tabular EHR data, using pre-training and sequential ordering; improves discrimination, calibration, and downstream model influence across diseases and populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic attributes are universally present and predictive but underutilized; a generalizable representation could improve predictive performance across tasks and geographic regions.

Method: Pre-train GDP on tabular demographic inputs with various encoding and ordering strategies; evaluate across diseases and geographic populations; assess performance via discrimination and calibration metrics and information gain at decision tree splits; test impact on downstream gradient boosting models.

Result: Sequential ordering substantially improves discrimination and calibration; GDP increases information gain at tree splits and strengthens demographic influence in downstream models; performance gains generalize across tasks and populations, even when demographic attributes have relatively low predictive value.

Conclusion: Foundational demographic representations can generalize across tasks and populations and improve predictive performance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

### [166] [FedTeddi: Temporal Drift and Divergence Aware Scheduling for Timely Federated Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07342)
*Yuxuan Bai,Yuxuan Sun,Tan Chen,Wei Chen,Sheng Zhou,Zhisheng Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTeddi is a scheduling and bandwidth allocation method for federated edge learning that accounts for temporal data drift and non-i.i.d. divergence, enabling fast adaptation to evolving data under communication constraints and improving convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real FEEL, clients collect data over time, leading to time-varying, non-i.i.d. distributions. Static assumptions hinder timely adaptation and can cause forgetting of previously learned knowledge.

Method: Quantify temporal drift and collective divergence via Earth Mover's Distance on class distributions; formulate a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation objective; implement FedTeddi to prioritize updates from data-drifted clients and allocate bandwidth to accelerate learning while mitigating forgetting.

Result: Experimentally, FedTeddi achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence, with convergence-rate improvements of 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Conclusion: FedTeddi effectively enables timely adaptation of FEEL to evolving data under resource constraints by accounting for drift and divergence in client data distributions, improving convergence speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

*Qihu Xie,Yuan Li,Yi Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBS is a parameter-efficient method that suppresses spectral bias in neural representations for neural networks to improve weight reconstruction; it uses unidirectional ordering smoothing and frequency-aware random Fourier features, achieving better accuracy with fewer parameters on ResNet across CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the spectral bias of standard MLPs used in neural representations for NN weights, which limits reconstruction of high-frequency details and hampers compression efficiency.

Method: Two techniques: (1) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing to improve kernel smoothness in the output space; (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random Fourier features that adaptively modulate input frequency bandwidth according to layer-wise parameter counts.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ResNet models with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet show SBS achieves significantly better reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SBS provides a parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representations for neural networks by suppressing spectral bias and enabling accurate high-frequency reconstruction with fewer parameters, promising improved weight compression.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

TL;DR: A framework combining EfficientNet-based deep learning with a patient-specific digital twin from IoT data to enable early detection and analysis of cardiac arrest, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early identification and management of cardiac arrest are critical; conventional methods lack personalization and continuous assessment. Integrating deep learning with a digital twin offers real-time, individualized analysis and prediction.

Method: Train an EfficientNet-based model with compound scaling to learn features from cardiovascular images, and construct a patient-specific digital twin of the cardiovascular system from IoT-derived data for ongoing assessment and simulation of treatment impacts.

Result: The approach achieves high predictive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient, demonstrating the potential of combining deep learning with digital twin technology for active, individualized cardiac risk prediction.

Conclusion: Merging advanced DL with digital twin technology provides an active, personalized framework for predicting and managing cardiac arrest in clinical settings.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

*Arslan Majal,Aamir Hussain Chughtai,Muhammad Tahir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMORF-II is a learning-enhanced, outlier-robust filter for correlated measurement noise that improves accuracy with an acceptable overhead by online learning of outlier characteristics and simultaneous outlier detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust state estimation under correlated noise with outliers by adding online learning of outlier characteristics; existing EM-based outlier-robust filters (EMORF) may lack adaptability to varying outlier patterns.

Method: Propose EMORF-II, an enhanced EM-based outlier-robust filter that incorporates an online learning component to characterize outliers during inference while performing outlier detection, preserving the EM framework.

Result: Numerical experiments show accuracy gains over state-of-the-art methods; computational overhead increases but remains on par with other practical methods.

Conclusion: EMORF-II offers improved outlier mitigation and adaptability in correlated-noise settings, making it a useful choice across diverse applications with a favorable balance between accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of
EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is
equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

### [171] [The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430)
*Long Li,Jiaran Hao,Jason Klein Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Xiaoyu Tan,Wei Chu,Zhe Wang,Shirui Pan,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies Pass@k degradation and forgetting in RLVR when using mode-seeking reverse KL or no divergence, and introduces DPH-RL, which uses mass-covering f-divergences as a rehearsal mechanism to preserve knowledge. This approach improves Pass@1 and Pass@k, both in- and out-of-domain, and is training-efficient due to sampling from the initial policy only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR objectives fail to preserve diverse knowledge, causing multi-attempt performance to degrade and leading to catastrophic forgetting. Reverse KL accelerates policy collapse, while absence of divergence offers no safeguards. A true solution should leverage the divergence term itself to maintain broad solution coverage.

Method: Propose Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL) which employs mass-covering f-divergences (e.g., forward-KL, JS-divergence) as a rehearsal mechanism by continuously referencing the initial policy. Divergence is computed via generator functions, using only samples from the initial policy and no online reference model.

Result: Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation show DPH-RL resolves Pass@k degradation and improves Pass@1 and Pass@k in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. It also offers better training efficiency due to divergence computation from the initial policy alone.

Conclusion: Choosing and utilizing a divergence measure is a crucial lever for enhancing RLVR. Mass-covering divergences can serve as an effective rehearsal mechanism to preserve diverse knowledge, enabling more general and robust reasoning models as demonstrated by DP H-RL.

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

*Antoine Ledent,Petr Kasalický,Rodrigo Alves,Hady W. Lauw*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Convolutional AutoEncoder model for recommender systems that jointly learns from explicit ratings and implicit feedback, modeling multi-type interactions and offering interpretable per-item rating probabilities, with generalization bounds and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoder-based recommenders struggle to leverage multiple interaction types and implicit signals; lacking theoretical guarantees and interpretability; need a single model handling both explicit and implicit feedback with bounds.

Method: A convolutional AutoEncoder architecture that learns associations across interaction types, trains jointly on explicit ratings and implicit sampling patterns, and produces separate predictions for content consumption and high ratings; provides generalization bounds and guarantees recovery of the sampling distribution up to small total variation error.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both implicit and explicit feedback tasks across real datasets; yields interpretable per-item probabilities for each rating and can identify items users would not consume but would enjoy when exposed.

Conclusion: The proposed model advances recommender systems by unifying implicit/explicit feedback modeling with theoretical guarantees and interpretable outputs, while delivering strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel short-term DMA water demand forecast using unsupervised contrastive learning to segment users by consumption behavior, then forecast via wavelet-CNN with cross-attention on history and behavior features; evaluated on real DMAs over six months with up to 4.9% MAPE improvement and insights into socioeconomic-driven patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate-change induced uncertainty threatens water security; leveraging smart-meter data to improve demand forecasting and understand drivers behind consumption.

Method: 1) Apply unsupervised contrastive learning to cluster end-users within each DMA by consumption patterns. 2) Use the resulting behavioral representations as features in a wavelet-transformed CNN forecasting model that employs cross-attention between historical data and derived representations. 3) Evaluate on real DMAs over six months, comparing forecast accuracy (MAPE).

Result: Forecast accuracy improved, with up to 4.9% relative MAPE improvement across DMAs; also identifies consumers whose behavior is shaped by socioeconomic factors, enriching knowledge about deterministic demand drivers.

Conclusion: Integrating behavior-driven representations with wavelet-CNN forecasting enhances short-term water demand predictions under uncertainty and provides actionable insight into behavioral drivers, aiding resource planning.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoseCDL is a scalable, robust convolutional dictionary learning approach for unsupervised rare event detection in long signals, using stochastic windowing and inline outlier detection to handle large datasets and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale signals in fields like astronomy, physics, and biomedicine contain recurring patterns and rare events. CDL models local structure but is computationally expensive and sensitive to artifacts/outliers, limiting its use for anomaly detection.

Method: RoseCDL employs stochastic windowing to train CDL efficiently on large datasets and integrates inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate anomalous patterns, reframing CDL as a tool for event discovery.

Result: The method enables practical unsupervised rare event discovery in long signals, demonstrating scalability and robustness to artifacts, and extending CDL’s usefulness beyond compression or denoising.

Conclusion: RoseCDL makes convolutional dictionary learning a viable tool for discovering and characterizing rare events in real-world signals, broadening CDL’s applications to anomaly detection and event characterization.

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

*Zhiyuan He,Xufang Luo,Yike Zhang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta L Normalization is a loss aggregation method for RLVR that yields an unbiased policy loss with minimal gradient variance under variable generation lengths, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic generation lengths in RLVR cause high gradient variance and unstable optimization. Existing normalization methods (GRPO, DAPO, Dr. GRPO) can introduce bias or fail to sufficiently reduce variance. There is a need for a minimum-variance unbiased estimator of policy loss.

Method: The authors analyze how varying lengths affect policy loss both theoretically and empirically, reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and propose Delta L Normalization to achieve unbiased loss estimation while minimizing gradient variance. The approach is supported by theoretical justification and extensive experiments across model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks; code will be released at GitHub.

Result: Extensive experiments show Delta L Normalization consistently improves performance across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks.

Conclusion: Delta L Normalization provides an unbiased policy-loss estimate with reduced gradient variance in RLVR, offering a simple, effective solution for handling variable-length generations in training; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

TL;DR: A neural network with neurons that activate according to a univariate Gaussian mixture (uGMM-NN) is proposed, enabling probabilistic reasoning and multimodal activations; it matches MLP performance while providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorporate uncertainty and multimodality directly into neuron activations to enrich representations without sacrificing scalability.

Method: Each node models its activation as a univariate Gaussian mixture with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients; integrated into a standard feedforward architecture; trained end-to-end.

Result: Shows competitive discriminative performance relative to standard MLPs and adds a probabilistic interpretation of activations.

Conclusion: This framework lays groundwork for uncertainty-aware components in modern networks and bridges discriminative and generative modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

*Liya Gaynutdinova,Martin Doškář,Ondřej Rokoš,Ivana Pultarová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual PINN framework with guaranteed error bounds is proposed to improve homogenization in periodic thermo-conductive composites, enabling robust handling of discontinuous coefficients; VPINNs with appropriate test functions offer stability advantages, while dual bounds serve as convergence diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with discontinuous coefficients in multiscale homogenization. There is a need for reliable error estimates and diagnostics to ensure robustness and detect PINN failure in micromechanics problems.

Method: Develop a dual formulation of PINNs for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. Derive guaranteed upper and lower error bounds using the dual approach. Compare standard PINNs on smoothed material models with VPINNs using spectral and neural-network test functions; analyze stability and how test-function choice affects results.

Result: Strong-form PINNs can outperform VPINNs in controlled settings but are sensitive to discontinuities and may fail without diagnostics. VPINNs handle piecewise-constant materials directly and can be destabilized by poor test-function choices; the dual formulation consistently provides convergence indicators and bounds that improve reliability.

Conclusion: The dual PINN framework enhances the robustness and applicability of PINNs to homogenization problems in micromechanics by providing guaranteed error bounds and diagnostics, with VPINNs offering advantages in discontinuous media when paired with appropriate test functions.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based deep learning approach optimizes sensor placement for structural health monitoring of semiconductor probe cards, achieving near-perfect classification of health states and high crack-detection recall; physics-informed data augmentation and attention analysis identify critical sensor locations for cost-effective monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probe cards experience failures (e.g., substrate cracks, loose screws) that degrade yield and reliability. Sensor-enabled monitoring coupled with ML can detect failures and guide optimal sensor placement to enable proactive maintenance.

Method: A hybrid CNN-Transformer model is trained on frequency response data generated from a finite element model of a probe card. The dataset is expanded via physics-informed scenario expansion and physics-aware data augmentation. Model validation uses 3 repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism identifies critical sensor locations to inform sensor configuration optimization.

Result: Classification accuracy of 99.83% across health states (baseline, loose screw, crack) and crack detection recall of 99.73%. The model demonstrates robustness under repeated cross-validation. Attention weights provide actionable insights for sensor placement, enabling efficient, cost-effective monitoring.

Conclusion: Attention-based deep learning can enhance proactive maintenance in semiconductor manufacturing by enabling accurate health monitoring and by guiding sensor deployment to optimize reliability and yield with potentially lower sensor deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate

physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems

### [180] [Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605)
*Ali Nawaz,Amir Ahmad,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Among binary classifiers facing severe class imbalance without explicit rebalancing, modern models (e.g., TabPFN, boosting ensembles) show stronger robustness and generalization than traditional classifiers, especially as minority size shrinks and data complexity grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where the performance of binary classifiers under imbalanced conditions is rarely evaluated without rebalancing techniques, to guide model choice in critical domains.

Method: Systematic evaluation on real-world and synthetic datasets with progressively reduced minority sizes (one-shot and few-shot baselines); synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate varying complexity; assessment of standard classifiers, undersampling, oversampling, and one-class classification (OCC); analysis via visual interpretability and standard metrics.

Result: Classification becomes harder with increasing data complexity and smaller minority class size. Traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, while TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better generalization.

Conclusion: Provides guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning in the absence of rebalancing techniques, highlighting robustness trends and informing choices for practitioners dealing with imbalanced data.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GB-IG extends Integrated Gradients to graphs, enabling attribution of graph structure and nodes/edges for GNNs, and outperforms standard IG in identifying key components for node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrated Gradients (IG) assumes continuous data, but graphs are discrete structures. There is a need for an explainability method that can attribute importance to graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs) and node classification tasks.

Method: Introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG), an extension of IG to graphs. GB-IG computes gradient-based attributions over graph structure to identify crucial structural components (nodes/edges) used by the classifier. Evaluation on four synthetic datasets and three real-world graph datasets. Comparison with IG for node classification tasks.

Result: GB-IG accurately identifies crucial structural components on synthetic datasets and outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification on real-world graph datasets.

Conclusion: GB-IG is a promising extension of IG to discrete graph data, improving interpretability of GNNs for node classification by attributing importance to graph structure and components.

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

### [182] [FUnc-SNE: A flexible, Fast, and Unconstrained algorithm for neighbour embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07681)
*Pierre Lambert,Edouard Couplet,Michel Verleysen,John Aldo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a novel NE acceleration method that preserves fine-grained structures with low per-iteration cost, supports arbitrary embedding dimensionality, and enables interactive hyperparameter control, using an innovative iterative approximate nearest neighbor search and GPU-accelerated GUI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between fast, coarse NE (e.g., negative sampling in UMAP) and slower, high-precision NE (e.g., FIt-SNE, BH-t-SNE) that typically restricts embeddings to 2D/3D, enabling fast, interactive exploration without sacrificing structure or dimensionality.

Method: A novel iterative approximate nearest neighbor search integrated into NE, delivering small computational cost per iteration, flexibility through hyperparameters, and a non-two-phased pipeline that allows immediate visual feedback; implemented with a GPU-accelerated GUI to facilitate interactive experimentation.

Result: Demonstrates speedups and flexibility in the structures captured by NE, with promising comparisons to nearest neighbor descent, and potential applicability beyond visualization, suggesting practical benefits for broader ML contexts.

Conclusion: Bridging the gap between coarse and precise NE methods, the approach enables fast, fine-grained, interactive embeddings without dimensionality constraints, warranting further exploration and broader application with minor algorithmic adaptations.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

### [183] [IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725)
*Shusen Ma,Tianhao Zhang,Qijiu Xia,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBN proposes an interpretable, uncertainty-aware approach for multivariate time series forecasting with missing variables, combining uncertainty-aware interpolation and Gaussian-kernel graph convolution, plus bidirectional temporal modeling to improve robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing variables significantly degrade MTSF performance and interpretability in standard spatial-temporal GNNs. Existing methods (e.g., GinAR) address missingness but lack interpretability and rich temporal pattern modeling.

Method: IBN integrates Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) with MC Dropout to quantify uncertainty in reconstructed values, uses Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN) to model spatial correlations among variables, and employs bidirectional recurrent units for enhanced temporal dependency modeling. It also applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to downweight high-risk imputations, jointly handling imputation and forecasting.

Result: Experimental results indicate state-of-the-art forecasting performance across varying missing-rate scenarios, along with improved reliability and interpretability, compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: IBN provides a more interpretable and robust framework for MTSF with missing variables, addressing both accuracy and uncertainty concerns; code is available at the given repository.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

### [184] [MoE-Compression: How the Compression Error of Experts Affects the Inference Accuracy of MoE Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07727)
*Songkai Ma,Zhaorui Zhang,Sheng Di,Benben Liu,Xiaodong Yu,Xiaoyi Lu,Dan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compress non-activated MoE experts with error-bounded lossy compressors to lower memory transfer overhead, and analyze how layer-specific compression errors affect inference accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-based LLMs face GPU memory constraints. Offloading inactive experts helps but incurs data transfer overhead. It is crucial to understand how compression-induced errors affect inference to design efficient, memory-friendly MoE serving strategies.

Method: Apply error-bounded lossy compression (SZ3 and CuSZp) to non-activated experts, then evaluate inference accuracy across benchmarks, analyzing error impact by expert layer (shallow, middle, deep).

Result: Shallow-layer experts show minimal accuracy degradation under bounded errors; middle-layer experts experience significant accuracy impairment; deep-layer experts can sometimes see accuracy improvements when bounded errors are introduced.

Conclusion: Layer-aware compression is viable: shallow layers tolerate bounded errors well, middle layers are sensitive, and deep layers may even benefit from certain bounded errors. This supports selective, layer-aware offloading and compression strategies in MoE serving.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Abstract: This study applies a range of forecasting techniques,including ARIMA,
Prophet, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional

through the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models,
particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially
under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model
architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of
ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available

### [186] [Predicting person-level injury severity using crash narratives: A balanced approach with roadway classification and natural language process techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07845)
*Mohammad Zana Majidi,Sajjad Karimi,Teng Wang,Robert Kluger,Reginald Souleyrette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating narrative crash reports with structured data improves injury severity prediction; TF-IDF features with XGBoost performed best across road type stratifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured crash narratives may capture contextual information not present in structured data, potentially improving prediction accuracy, addressing class imbalance, roadway heterogeneity, and informing policy and emergency response.

Method: Extract textual features from police narratives using TF-IDF and Word2Vec; address class imbalance with a KNN-based oversampling method; build 102 models by combining narrative features with structured data across three road-class schemes and three ensemble algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost). Evaluate across subgroups.

Result: Narrative-inclusive models outperform structured-only models; TF-IDF + XGBoost yielded the highest accuracy in most subgroups.

Conclusion: Combining text with structured crash data provides a practical, adaptable framework for predicting injury severity and guiding safety interventions; supports transportation safety practitioners.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

### [187] [Addressing the Cold-Start Problem for Personalized Combination Drug Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07850)
*Antoine de Mathelin,Christopher Tosh,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretrained deep learning model uses drug-combination embeddings and dose-level importance to guide initial, informative experiments in oncology drug-screening; combines functional diversity via clustering with dose-weighting; retrospective simulations show improved early-phase screening efficiency for personalized combination therapies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vast drug-dose combinatorial space and cold-start problem in personalized oncology, where ex vivo screening is limited and molecular profiling is often impractical due to a narrow therapeutic window.

Method: Leverage a pretrained model trained on historical drug-response data to provide embeddings for drug combinations and dose-level importance scores; enforce functional diversity by clustering embeddings; apply dose-weighting based on historical informativeness to select initial experiments. Retrospective simulations validate approach.

Result: Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug combination datasets show substantial improvement in initial screening efficiency over baselines.

Conclusion: This strategy enables more effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens and offers a viable path for efficient, informative initial testing when patient information is limited.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-omics SVR model integrating radiomics, dosiomics, and delta features predicts GTV changes in PULSAR brain metastases with high accuracy (R2 ~0.74, RRMSE ~0.022) using 5x10-fold CV on 39 patients/69 lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, personalized prediction of GTV evolution is critical for PULSAR; leverages imaging and dose features to improve prognostic value and treatment decisions, especially given the small dataset.

Method: Retrospective study of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases. Extract radiomics features from MRI and dosiomics from dose maps; compute delta features between timepoints; apply Lasso-based feature selection with ranking criteria; train SVR models with multiple kernels; evaluate with R2 and RRMSE; use 5-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats.

Result: Multi-omics models outperform single-omics; delta features enhance predictive accuracy; top model achieves R2=0.743 and RRMSE=0.022.

Conclusion: Multi-omics SVR is a promising approach to predict continuous GTV change, enabling quantitative, personalized patient selection and treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

*Philipp Lepold,Jonas Leichtle,Tobias Röddiger,Michael Beigl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Single-channel in-ear EEG with a dry electrode can detect sleep vs. wake and classify sleep stages in a small wearable study, showing promise for unobtrusive, real-world sleep monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable long-term, comfortable sleep monitoring outside laboratories by using in-ear electrophysiological signals that may correlate with full-scalp EEG, addressing the need for detecting sleep onset in consumer applications.

Method: 11 participants (mean age 24) wore a custom in-ear device with a dry eartip electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground truth sleep stages were labeled using an Apple Watch Ultra. Leave-one-subject-out validation was used for performance assessment.

Result: Binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) accuracy: 90.5%. Four-class sleep staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep) accuracy: 65.1%.

Conclusion: In-ear single-channel ExG shows potential as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep monitoring with real-world applications (e.g., pausing media playback when the user falls asleep), though validation with larger samples and more robust ground-truth may be needed.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular online convex-concave optimization algorithm achieves near-minimax optimal dynamic duality gap in time-varying two-player games, using adaptive, predictor-aggregation, and integration modules with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online convex-concave games extend online convex optimization to two-player, time-varying settings. The objective is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap) against arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms underperform, especially in stationary or predictable environments.

Method: Proposes a three-module architecture: (1) Adaptive Module that adjusts to non-stationarity, (2) Multi-Predictor Aggregator that selects the best predictor among multiple candidates, and (3) Integration Module that fuses strengths. The design is modular, enabling replacement of components to regulate adaptability and to integrate side knowledge from multiple predictors. Theoretical guarantees include minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound up to a logarithmic factor and prediction-error-driven D-DGap bounds.

Result: The algorithm attains the stated minimax-optimal D-DGap bound (up to log factors) and provides bounds driven by prediction error. Empirical results demonstrate adaptability and effectiveness in varying environments.

Conclusion: The modular design allows swapping components to tailor adaptability and incorporate side knowledge, achieving robust performance in dynamic online two-player convex-concave games, with empirical validation supporting the approach.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,

arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version
releases. By offering up-to-date embeddings with minimal computational effort
required from users, Bio-KGvec2go facilitates efficient and timely biomedical
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advocates using inverse problems to derive scaling laws for LLMs to improve cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require enormous training costs; brute-force scaling is infeasible. Inspired by inverse problems in science, the paper argues that uncovering scaling laws via inverse problem approaches can guide the design of LLMs to achieve desirable performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a conceptual inverse-problem framework: treat model performance as a function of variables such as model size, data, and compute; invert this relationship to infer scaling laws. Outlines how this perspective can be integrated into LLM development and evaluation.

Result: A position paper that outlines a research agenda and potential benefits of applying inverse problems to derive scaling laws; no empirical results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Inverse-problem–driven discovery of scaling laws can efficiently guide the construction of LLMs to achieve target performance with improved cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

### [194] [One Model for All Tasks: Leveraging Efficient World Models in Multi-Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07945)
*Yuan Pu,Yazhe Niu,Jia Tang,Junyu Xiong,Shuai Hu,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleZero: a one-model, large-scale heterogeneous multi-task RL framework that combines a Mixture-of-Experts backbone with online, LoRA-based dynamic parameter scaling. It matches single-task baselines and, when equipped with DPS, reduces required environment interactions to 80% of the single-task level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous multi-task reinforcement learning involves tasks with diverse observation/action spaces and varying intrinsic difficulty. Gradient conflicts and limited model plasticity hinder a single, shared model from efficiently learning across tasks, especially in large-scale settings. The goal is to improve sample and computational efficiency while maintaining performance using one model.

Method: Extend UniZero to multi-task planning via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (ScaleZero) to mitigate gradient conflicts. Introduce online dynamic parameter scaling (DPS) that progressively inserts LoRA adapters in response to task progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion during training.

Result: Empirical results on Atari, DMControl, and Jericho show ScaleZero with a single model using online RL achieves performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. When combined with DPS, the method remains competitive while requiring only 80% of the single-task environment interaction steps.

Conclusion: ScaleZero demonstrates the viability of large-scale heterogeneous MT RL with one model by reducing gradient conflicts via MoE and improving training efficiency via dynamic LoRA-based parameter scaling. The approach achieves strong performance across standard benchmarks, with code available at the cited repository.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available
at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.

*Kasra Borazjani,Naji Khosravan,Rajeev Sahay,Bita Akram,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for education, combining multi-modal, multi-task foundation models with federated learning to enable privacy-preserving, personalized, and inclusive AI across decentralized educational institutions, while outlining an extensive research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data that hinder deployment of M3T foundation models in education by enabling collaborative training across institutions without sharing raw data, thereby enhancing privacy, personalization, and equity.

Method: A position paper outlining a federation-based architecture that integrates M3T foundation models with federated learning, emphasizing modular architectures for personalization (students, instructors, institutions), privacy preservation (local data), and handling data/modality heterogeneity; and proposing future research directions including inter-institution privacy heterogeneity, modality non-uniformity, unlearning, continual learning, and interpretability.

Result: The paper offers a conceptual framework and a research agenda rather than empirical results; it highlights potential benefits and the challenges to be addressed for practical deployment of M3T FedFMs in education.

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs are a promising but underexplored approach for next-generation intelligent education systems, requiring coordinated attention to privacy regulations, data modality heterogeneity, unlearning, continual learning, and interpretability to enable real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

### [196] [ACE and Diverse Generalization via Selective Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07955)
*Oliver Daniels,Stuart Armstrong,Alexandre Maranhão,Mahirah Fairuz Rahman,Benjamin M. Marlin,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACE is a self-training framework that resolves underspecification from complete spurious correlations by learning multiple concepts that align with training data but disagree on certain unlabeled inputs; it achieves strong performance, is configurable, and shows early success in alignment tasks without trusted measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations can be complete, causing generalization to be inherently underspecified. There is a need for methods that represent multiple valid concepts and can select among them without relying on labeled counterexamples.

Method: ACE learns a set of concepts consistent with labeled data but capable of making distinct predictions on unlabeled inputs. It uses a self-training objective that promotes confident and selective disagreement among concepts, allows prior knowledge encoding, and enables principled unsupervised model selection. The approach is demonstrated on complete-spurious correlation benchmarks and an initial language-model alignment task.

Result: ACE matches or surpasses existing methods on complete-spurious correlation benchmarks and remains robust to incomplete correlations. Its configurability improves prior knowledge encoding and enables unsupervised model selection. In early language-model alignment experiments, ACE achieves competitive results on tampering-detection benchmarks without access to untrusted measurements.

Conclusion: ACE represents meaningful progress toward overcoming underspecification from spurious correlations by providing a configurable, self-training framework that leverages multiple consistent concepts. While limitations remain, it offers a flexible approach with potential for broader impact, including alignment tasks without trusted measurements.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

*Yilun Kuang,Noah Amsel,Sanae Lotfi,Shikai Qiu,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structured attention using Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices improves efficiency and preserves high-dimensional information, outperforming standard attention on high-dimensional tasks and showing favorable scaling for language modeling and time-series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information loss from low-dimensional projections in standard attention and the lack of distance-dependent compute bias, by enabling high-rank, efficient, and locality-aware scoring functions.

Method: Introduce scoring functions based on structured matrices (BTT and MLR) that permit high-rank representations and distance-aware computation; argue these fit into a broader family of efficient structured matrices.

Result: In-context regression with high-dimensional inputs: proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. Language modeling: MLR-based attention yields improved scaling laws over standard attention and sliding-window variants. MLR/ BTT belong to a broader family capable of encoding full-rank or distance-dependent biases. Time-series forecasting: MLR shows promising results for long-range forecasting.

Conclusion: Efficient structured attention (BTT/MLR) addresses key shortcomings of standard attention by enabling full-rank and distance-dependent biases within an efficient framework, with strong indications of improved performance and scalability across modalities.

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

### [198] [Theoretical Analysis on how Learning Rate Warmup Accelerates Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07972)
*Yuxing Liu,Yuze Ge,Rui Pan,An Kang,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generalized smoothness framework is proposed to analyze learning rate warmup in training deep nets; shows that warmup accelerates gradient descent in both deterministic and stochastic settings, with a possible speedup up to Theta(T) over non-increasing schedules in some cases; theory supported by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical success of learning rate warmup lacks solid theoretical understanding; need a unified framework to justify acceleration and quantify its benefits.

Method: Introduce a family of generalized smoothness assumptions; perform convergence analysis of gradient descent with warmup in deterministic and stochastic settings; corroborate findings with empirical experiments.

Result: Learning rate warmup consistently accelerates GD; in some specific cases, GD with warmup can be at most Theta(T) times faster than with a non-increasing schedule.

Conclusion: The generalized smoothness framework provides theoretical justification for warmup, clarifying when and why it helps and offering insight into optimization dynamics in training deep networks.

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.
