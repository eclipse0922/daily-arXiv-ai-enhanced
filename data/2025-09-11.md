Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey establishing definitions and a taxonomy for 3D/4D world modeling, outlining VideoGen, OccGen, and LiDARGen, and summarizing datasets, metrics, applications, challenges, and future directions, with a public repository for reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work emphasizes 2D generative methods and lacks a standardized definition/taxonomy for 3D/4D world modeling, leading to fragmented claims. A unified framework is needed to advance the field.

Method: Systematic literature review that defines precise terms, introduces a structured taxonomy (VideoGen, OccGen, LiDARGen), and synthesizes datasets, evaluation metrics, applications, and challenges across 3D/4D world modeling and generation.

Result: A coherent, foundational reference that unifies 3D/4D world modeling literature, provides a taxonomy and curated summaries of datasets/metrics, discusses applications, and outlines open challenges and research directions.

Conclusion: The survey offers a foundational resource to advance 3D/4D world modeling, standardizing terminology, clarifying claims, and guiding future research, with supporting materials available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

*Shahid Shafi Dar,Bharat Kaurav,Arnav Jain,Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet introduces a triad of modules—Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention, Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention, and Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement—to jointly fuse visual and textual cues for urban flood classification, achieving state-of-the-art F1-scores on Chennai, Rhine18, and Harz17 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding is escalating with climate change, and current flood detection methods rely on unimodal data and static rule-based systems that fail to capture dynamic, non-linear flood dynamics. Additionally, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble methods struggle with hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and robustness in noisy or unstructured environments, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Three novel components: (1) Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention that dynamically aligns visual and textual features for precise multi-granularity interactions; (2) Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention with frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; (3) Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement to harmonize hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations for robust, noise-resistant detection.

Result: Evaluated on three benchmark datasets—Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods—XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

Conclusion: XFloodNet provides a robust, cross-modal, multi-scale flood classification framework that addresses unimodal limitations and noisy environments through hierarchical attention, frequency-aware feature extraction, and cascading transformer-based refinement, achieving strong generalization across multiple flood datasets.

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)
*Hyungjin Chung,Hyelin Nam,Jiyeon Kim,Hyojun Go,Byeongjun Park,Junho Kim,Joonseok Lee,Seongsu Ha,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) enables multiple parallel inference streams on disjoint frame subsets to increase perceptual bandwidth for VideoLLMs without expanding the context window, yielding improved temporal reasoning and robustness with memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck: higher frame counts improve temporal detail but blow up compute and degrade performance due to long context; need a way to access more visual information without extending the model's context window or retraining.

Method: At inference time, run several parallel streams, each processing a unique, disjoint subset of frames. Aggregate the output probabilities across streams to form a richer combined probability distribution. The approach leverages uncorrelated visual evidence to effectively contract the scaling law; requires no training.

Result: Across 2B–32B VideoLLMs on benchmarks such as Video-MME and EventHallusion, VPS yields consistent, significant performance gains, outpacing other parallel approaches (e.g., Self-consistency) and being complementary to decoding strategies; also memory-efficient and robust.

Conclusion: VPS offers a practical, inference-time method to boost temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs by expanding perceptual bandwidth without altering the context window, scalable across architectures and compatible with existing decoding techniques.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

### [4] [Two Stage Context Learning with Large Language Models for Multimodal Stance Detection on Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08024)
*Lata Pangtey,Omkar Kabde,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal stance detection framework that fuses textual summaries and visual captions via a hierarchical transformer, achieving ~76% metrics on MultiClimate and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stance detection in social media is increasingly multimodal; existing approaches focus on text; need to integrate text and images with topic-aware understanding.

Method: LLM-based retrieval of stance-relevant summaries from source text; domain-aware image caption generator to describe visuals in target-topic context; a transformer module fuses reply text, summaries, and captions; hierarchical fusion of modalities.

Result: Evaluated on MultiClimate dataset with aligned video frames and transcripts; accuracy 76.2%, precision 76.3%, recall 76.2%, F1 76.2%; outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of integrating textual and visual modalities for stance detection; the framework provides robust performance through modality-aware fusion and LLM-assisted summarization.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces SI-EDTL, a two-stage swarm intelligence ensemble deep
transfer learning model for detecting multiple vehicles in UAV images. It
combines three pre-trained Faster R-CNN feature extractor models (InceptionV3,
ResNet50, GoogLeNet) with five transfer classifiers (KNN, SVM, MLP, C4.5,
Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

### [6] [MCTED: A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset for Digital Elevation Model Generation From Mars Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08027)
*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MCTED, a large ML-ready Martian DEM dataset (80,898 samples) with image, DEM, and masks, plus preprocessing tools and leakage-free splits; a small U-Net trained on MCTED outperforms zero-shot monocular depth model on elevation prediction; dataset and code are open source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable machine learning for Martian elevation prediction while addressing artefacts/missing data in large-scale DEMs, and to prevent data leakage across train/validation regions.

Method: A pipeline processes Mars CTX imagery and corresponding DEMs to produce 80,898 samples, each consisting of an optical patch, a DEM patch, and two masks indicating missing or altered regions. Data splits are designed to ensure no mutual spatial areas between training and validation. A small U-Net is trained on MCTED and compared against a zero-shot monocular depth model (DepthAnythingV2).

Result: The small U-Net trained specifically on MCTED achieves better elevation prediction than the zero-shot DepthAnythingV2 model, demonstrating the benefit of a dataset-tailored model and preparation. The authors also provide statistical analyses of the dataset.

Conclusion: MCTED provides a valuable, open dataset and tooling for Martian elevation prediction, highlighting that even compact models can outperform zero-shot baselines when trained on Mars-specific data, and supporting reproducible research in planetary ML.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a differentiable, near-quadratic, one-to-one matching loss for point clouds using Sinkhorn with a temperature-scaled similarity; improves distribution and convergence without non-differentiable ops; validated on ShapeNet and CSI2PC; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of Chamfer/HyperCD/InfoCD (many-to-one mappings, point congestion, poor coverage, non-differentiable index operations) and the cubic-cost EMD; aims for a practical, one-to-one, differentiable loss with efficient runtime.

Method: APML constructs a temperature-scaled similarity matrix from pairwise distances, applies Sinkhorn iterations to approximate one-to-one assignment, and analytically derives the temperature to guarantee a minimum assignment probability; yields near-quadratic complexity and differentiability; no manual hyperparameter tuning required.

Result: When integrated into PoinTr, PCN, FoldingNet on ShapeNet and CSI2PC, APML achieves faster convergence and better spatial distribution (especially in low-density regions) with equal or improved quantitative performance; code available.

Conclusion: APML provides a practical, differentiable alternative to EMD for point cloud tasks, balancing one-to-one assignment quality with computational efficiency and ease of use.

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:
https://github.com/apm-loss/apml.

### [8] [Lightweight Deep Unfolding Networks with Enhanced Robustness for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08205)
*Jingjing Liu,Yinchao Han,Xianchao Xiu,Jianhua Zhang,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight RPCA-based network (L-RPCANet) for infrared small target detection (ISTD) that emphasizes parameter efficiency and noise robustness via hierarchical bottlenecks and SENet attention, achieving state-of-the-art results within the RPCANet family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISTD requires robust detection in noisy infrared imagery with limited labeled data. Deep unfolding networks offer interpretability but are often heavy; there is a need for a lightweight, robust, and data-adaptive approach that preserves interpretability.

Method: Proposes L-RPCANet, a lightweight framework built on robust PCA. It uses a hierarchical bottleneck structure to adapt channel dimensions in single-channel infrared images, with bottleneck layers for feature extraction. A noise reduction module is embedded to mitigate complex noise, and SENets are used for channel attention to emphasize important features. The architecture aims to reduce parameters while maintaining performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISTD datasets show superior performance over RPCANet variants (RPCANet, DRPCANet, RPCANet++) within the same family. The authors also provide a code repository for reproducibility.

Conclusion: L-RPCANet delivers a highly lightweight yet robust ISTD solution, combining RPCA-based decomposition, hierarchical bottlenecks, noise reduction, and channel attention to achieve competitive accuracy with substantially fewer parameters.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) for video snapshot compressive imaging introduces a highly sparse per-pixel encoding and a transformer-based reconstructor (BSTFormer) to recover high-speed frames; it outperforms prior methods and offers higher dynamic range, supporting potential on-chip, fixed-exposure video systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the energy and scalability challenges of high-resolution, high-frame-rate cameras, existing sampling schemes (e.g., Random Sampling) and image inpainting are insufficient. USS aims to drastically reduce per-pixel measurements while enabling high-quality recovery, addressing power constraints and enabling on-chip implementation.

Method: Propose USS: at each spatial location, only one sub-frame is active (1) and others are inactive (0). Build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to validate USS, and face imperfect decomposition due to DMD-CCD mismatch. Introduce BSTFormer, a sparse transformer leveraging local block attention, global sparse attention, and global temporal attention to exploit USS sparsity for high-speed frame reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real data show BSTFormer with USS significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. USS also provides higher dynamic range than Random Sampling, and the approach supports a complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Conclusion:  USS is a promising strategy for energy-efficient, high-frame-rate video SCI, with BSTFormer enabling effective reconstruction from ultra-sparse measurements and facilitating on-chip, fixed-exposure implementations.

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

### [10] [GTA-Crime: A Synthetic Dataset and Generation Framework for Fatal Violence Detection with Adversarial Snippet-Level Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08232)
*Seongho Kim,Sejong Ryu,Hyoukjun You,Je Hyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTA-Crime provides a GTA5-based fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework, plus a snippet-level Wasserstein-domain adaptation to improve real-world fatal-violence detection; the dataset and framework are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fatal violent incidents (shootings, stabbings) are rare and hard to collect in real data due to ethical concerns; existing VAD datasets lack such events, hindering progress. Synthetic data from GTA5 can supplement real data, but a domain gap remains that must be bridged for effective real-world deployment.

Method: Construct GTA-Crime: a fatal-video dataset with shootings and stabbings captured from CCTV multiviews under diverse conditions (action types, weather, time of day, viewpoints); provide a video generation framework to synthesize such footage. Propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to align GTA-Crime features with real-world features (e.g., UCF-Crime).

Result: Experiments validate the usefulness of GTA-Crime and show that combining GTA-Crime with the proposed domain adaptation improves real-world fatal-violence detection accuracy.

Conclusion: GTA-Crime and its generation framework offer a valuable resource for fatal-violence detection; the snippet-level Wasserstein domain adaptation reduces the realism gap and enhances cross-domain generalization; the dataset and framework are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at
https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.

*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepViT-CXR introduces a channel replication strategy to adapt grayscale chest X-rays for Vision Transformers (ViTs), achieving state-of-the-art TB and pneumonia detection across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs pretrained on natural RGB images require 3-channel inputs, while chest X-rays are grayscale. The paper seeks a simple method to adapt grayscale images without information loss to leverage ViT power.

Method: Proposes RepViT-CXR channel replication to convert single-channel CXR into ViT-compatible 3-channel input and evaluates on TB-CXR, Pediatric Pneumonia, and Shenzhen TB datasets; compares to Topo-CXR, DCNN, VGG16.

Result: TB-CXR: 99.9% accuracy, 99.9% AUC (beats Topo-CXR 99.3/99.8). Pediatric Pneumonia: 99.0% accuracy, 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, 99.0% AUC. Shenzhen TB: 91.1% accuracy, 91.2% AUC; outperforming CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: Channel replication enables ViTs to effectively process grayscale medical images and sets new state-of-the-art for TB and pneumonia detection in CXR; potential for real-world clinical screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end 3D CNN encoder with a Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT) detects disease-based left-right brain asymmetry in AD from sMRI, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability without pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked asymmetry in brain atrophy caused by Alzheimer's disease and limitations of CNNs/transformers that rely on pretraining or ignore hemispheric asymmetry, aiming for better accuracy and interpretable localization of asymmetric changes.

Method: Build a 3D CNN encoder to extract features from sMRI, align left/right hemispheres via an inter-equal grid block fetch operation, and feed paired features into a Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT) for diagnostic analysis in an end-to-end framework.

Result: On the ADNI dataset, the method achieves 92.5% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming several CNN baselines and CNNs combined with a general transformer; visualization shows the model focuses on brain atrophy regions, especially asymmetric patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed SIT-based framework effectively captures disease-induced structural asymmetry in AD, improving diagnostic performance and providing interpretable insights into asymmetric brain changes.

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

*Chi Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Chenxu Jiang,Gui-Song Xia,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVDI++ presents a unified self-supervised framework that uses event cameras to reduce motion blur and interpolate intermediate frames, via the Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network, a division reconstruction module, and an adaptive fusion strategy, trained end-to-end with real-world blurry videos and events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based cameras with long exposure cause blur and info loss; event cameras offer high temporal resolution to mitigate blur and enable frame interpolation. A self-supervised approach is desirable to train on real-world data without heavy labeling.

Method: Proposes the Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network to map reference frames to sharp latent images. Adds a learning-based division reconstruction module to handle varying exposure intervals. Introduces an adaptive, parameter-free fusion strategy that leverages confidence from concurrent event-derived outputs. Employs a self-supervised training framework that exploits relationships among blurry frames, latent images, and event streams. Builds a real-world dataset using a DAVIS346c camera.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on video deblurring and interpolation tasks, demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and shows generalization to real-world blurry videos with events.

Conclusion: EVDI++ delivers a unified, efficient, self-supervised solution that leverages event data to suppress motion blur and interpolate frames, validated by extensive experiments and a real-world DAVIS346c dataset.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

### [14] [Hyperspectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08265)
*Long Gao,Yunhe Zhang,Yan Jiang,Weiying Xie,Yunsong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hyperspectral object tracking network (HyMamba) uses spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling via Spectral State Integration (SSI) and Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) modules to achieve state-of-the-art tracking, demonstrated on seven benchmarks including HOTC2020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperspectral trackers either convert to false-color images or rely on simple modality fusion, but fail to capture intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions.

Method: SSI progressively refines+propagates spectral features using cross-depth and temporal spectral info; each SSI embeds an HSM that uses three directional scanning state-space models to learn spatial and spectral info synchronously; HyMamba fuses features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs and interacts with original spectral features; trained/tested on seven benchmarks; code released.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks; HOTC2020: AUC 73.0%, DP@20 96.3%; code at GitHub.

Conclusion: Unifying spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling via state-space modules yields robust hyperspectral tracking and sets a new performance baseline; potential for broader application and extension.

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

### [15] [Examining Vision Language Models through Multi-dimensional Experiments with Vision and Text Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08266)
*Saurav Sengupta,Nazanin Moradinasab,Jiebei Liu,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Small changes in image properties and prompt specificity cause large shifts in how VLMs answer questions about visuals, revealing persistent biases and the need for systematic characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models exhibit bias-driven responses, especially on highly specific questions. There is a need to quantify how input data characteristics influence model behavior and reliability.

Method: Proposes a multi-dimensional framework to study VLM behavior. Uses open-source VLMs and manipulates input factors (image size, number of objects, background color, prompt specificity) while tracking attention values and performance.

Result: Minor variations in image attributes and prompt detail can substantially alter the model's reasoning and resulting answers, along with attention patterns, indicating sensitive dependence on input configuration.

Conclusion: A systematic framework for characterizing VLM behavior with respect to input data enables better understanding of biases and guides development of more robust models and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

### [16] [Generalized Zero-Shot Learning for Point Cloud Segmentation with Evidence-Based Dynamic Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08280)
*Hyeonseok Kim,Byeongkeun Kang,Yeejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes E3DPC-GZSL for generalized zero-shot segmentation in 3D point clouds by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty estimator into a classifier, using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor to adjust predictions, and refining semantic space through merging learnable parameters with text-derived features; achieves state-of-the-art on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized zero-shot segmentation in 3D struggles with bias toward seen classes, exacerbated by smaller 3D training data. There is a need for uncertainty-aware methods that can reduce overconfidence without relying on separate seen/unseen classifiers.

Method: Introduce an evidence-based uncertainty estimator within the classifier, then use a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that adjusts prediction probabilities based on pointwise uncertainty. Also propose a training strategy that refines the semantic space by merging learnable parameters with text-derived features to improve optimization for unseen data.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks, specifically ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Conclusion: The approach reduces overconfident predictions toward seen classes without separate seen/unseen classifiers, improves uncertainty estimation and semantic space optimization for unseen data, and sets new performance benchmarks. Further work could explore robustness across datasets and potential computational overhead.

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

### [17] [Dual-Thresholding Heatmaps to Cluster Proposals for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08289)
*Yuelin Guo,Haoyu He,Zhiyuan Chen,Zitong Huang,Renhao Lu,Lu Shi,Zejun Wang,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) and a weakly supervised basic detection network (WSBDN) with negative certainty loss to improve weakly supervised object detection (WSOD); achieves competitive VOC 2007/2012 results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSOD methods struggle with: (1) pseudo GT boxes focusing on discriminative parts or merging adjacent instances, (2) lack of background class representation and semantic gap between WSDDN branches, (3) ignoring proposals during optimization leading to slow convergence.

Method: Introduce HGPS to pre-select proposals using dual heatmap thresholds, enabling pseudo GT boxes that cover full object extents and distinguish adjacent instances. Develop WSBDN that adds a background class representation per proposal and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge semantic gaps between matrices. Apply a negative certainty supervision loss on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 show strong performance: VOC2007 mAP 58.5% and mCorLoc 81.8%; VOC2012 mAP 55.6% and mCorLoc 80.5%, ranking favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods. Code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key WSOD limitations by improved pseudo GT generation, closing semantic gaps between network components, and faster convergence, demonstrating effectiveness on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

*Rongsheng Wang,Fenghe Tang,Qingsong Yao,Rui Yan,Xu Zhang,Zhen Huang,Haoran Lai,Zhiyang He,Xiaodong Tao,Zihang Jiang,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCroP is a similarity-driven cross-granularity pre-training framework for chest CT radiographs that uses multi-modal masked modeling, similarity-driven alignment, and cross-granularity fusion to align sentence-level reports with patch-level image regions, improving classification and segmentation across five CT datasets; code/models available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT lesions are spatially sparse and have intricate structures, while the relation between textual pathology descriptions and image regions is complex and implicit. This makes existing medical vision-language pre-training and self-supervised methods less effective at radiograph interpretation.

Method: 1) Use multi-modal masked modeling to train the encoder to capture precise low-level semantics from radiographs. 2) Employ similarity-driven alignment to adaptively select and align the correct patches with each sentence in reports. 3) Introduce a cross-granularity fusion module that integrates information across instance-level and word-patch-level representations to better capture key pathology structures.

Result: Pre-training on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset yields improved performance on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art medical self-supervised learning and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

Conclusion: SimCroP effectively handles sparse CT radiographs and complex text–region relationships, enabling better multi-scale representation learning for downstream tasks; the authors provide code and models on GitHub.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

### [20] [Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image Classification Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08318)
*Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTS-EE is a sequentially trained, calibrated early-exit framework that aligns branch training with inference-time selective inference, using lightweight 1D-conv branches and Class Precision Margin calibration. It achieves up to 45% compute reduction with ~2% accuracy loss on CINIC-10 with ResNet-18.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms requires high accuracy under strict latency and power budgets. Traditional early-exit training suffers a covariance shift because branches are trained on full datasets while inference uses harder, non-exited samples, limiting efficiency gains.

Method: Introduce Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE): sequentially train and calibrate each exit branch before the next one. Propose a lightweight exit branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions, optimizing for selective inference.

Result: On CINIC-10 with a ResNet-18 backbone, BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45% reduction in computation with only 2% accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: This approach expands the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems and offers practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar patient cases improves melanoma diagnosis with vision-language models, without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanoma diagnosis benefits from leveraging both dermoscopic images and clinical context, but CNNs typically ignore clinical metadata and require preprocessing, while general-domain vision-language models lack clinical specificity.

Method: Proposes a retrieval-augmented vision-language model that retrieves semantically similar patient cases and incorporates them into the diagnostic prompt, enabling informed predictions without fine-tuning.

Result: The approach significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over conventional baselines compared to non-retrieval, non-augmented methods.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented prompting provides a robust clinical decision-support strategy for malignant melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate error accumulation during feature extraction, perspective transformation, and fusion in multi-view 3D object detection.

Method: Introduce InsFusion that (1) extracts proposals from both raw and fused features, (2) uses these proposals to query raw features, and (3) applies attention mechanisms to raw features to reduce accumulated errors.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and shows compatibility with various strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: InsFusion effectively mitigates accumulated errors in multi-view 3D detection and yields improved performance, with flexible integration with existing baselines.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework that disentangles video into motion and content using transformer-based features, a vector quantization bottleneck, and a diffusion model, enabling motion transfer and generation on real and cartoon videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn flexible, disentangled video representations with fewer inductive biases than prior approaches, enabling robust motion/content manipulation across real and synthetic data.

Method: A hybrid architecture: transformer-based modules produce frame-wise motion features and clip-wise content; a low-bit-rate vector quantizer creates a discrete latent space enforcing disentanglement; the bitrate-conditioned motion/content feed into a denoising diffusion model for self-supervised learning; evaluated on talking heads and 2D sprites.

Result: Shows effective motion transfer and autoregressive motion generation on real talking head videos; demonstrates generalization to 2D cartoon sprites; advances self-supervised disentangled video representation learning.

Conclusion: Proposes a general, less biased framework for disentangled video representations that broadens applications in video analysis and generation.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

*Dubing Chen,Huan Zheng,Yucheng Zhou,Xianfei Li,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end trainable 2D-to-3D semantic occupancy with a causal loss that backpropagates from 3D voxels to 2D features, enabling holistic learning via Channel-Grouped Lifting, Learnable Camera Offsets, and Normalized Convolution; achieves state-of-the-art on Occ3D and robustness to camera perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular 2D-to-3D pipelines are prone to cascading errors because modules are optimized separately or rely on fixed inputs. A unified, end-to-end supervision grounded in 2D-to-3D semantic causality is needed to propagate information across the 2D–3D boundary and make all components learnable.

Method: Introduce a causal loss that regulates gradient flow from 3D voxel representations back to 2D features, making the pipeline differentiable end-to-end. Build the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation around three components guided by the causal loss: (1) Channel-Grouped Lifting for adaptive semantic mapping, (2) Learnable Camera Offsets for robustness to camera perturbations, and (3) Normalized Convolution for effective feature propagation.

Result: The approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, with demonstrated robustness to camera perturbations and improved consistency between 2D features and 3D semantic occupancy.

Conclusion: A principled causal loss enables holistic training of the 2D-to-3D pipeline, unifying learning across modules and leading to superior accuracy and robustness in vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature

state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

### [25] [VRAE: Vertical Residual Autoencoder for License Plate Denoising and Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08392)
*Cuong Nguyen,Dung T. Tran,Hong Nguyen,Xuan-Vu Phan,Nam-Phong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) for fast image enhancement in traffic surveillance; uses an input-aware auxiliary block to preserve information; outperforms AE, GAN, and Flow-based methods in PSNR/NMSE/SSIM with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world license plate recognition is hampered by degraded images due to noise, blur, and adverse conditions; a fast, effective pre-processing step is needed to improve recognition performance. Existing autoencoders, GANs, and flow-based restorations have limitations in preservation of details and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture that includes an auxiliary block injecting input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide representation learning and preserve general information. The design emphasizes lightweight, real-time enhancement suitable for license-plate-focused restoration and compares against AE, GAN, and Flow-based approaches.

Result: On a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates, VRAE consistently outperforms AE, GAN, and Flow-based methods. Compared with AE at the same depth, PSNR improves by ~20%, NMSE reduces by ~50%, SSIM increases by ~1%, with only a marginal parameter increase of ~1%.

Conclusion: VRAE is an effective and efficient image restoration approach for degraded traffic imagery, offering substantial quality gains with minimal extra computational cost, making it suitable as a real-time pre-processing step for license plate recognition.

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

### [26] [Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421)
*Keisuke Toida,Taigo Sakai,Naoki Kato,Kazutoyo Yokota,Takeshi Nakamura,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFusion introduces sparse BEV projection, density-aware feature fusion, and a multi-view consistency loss to improve multi-view MOT, achieving state-of-the-art results (IDF1 95.9% on WildTrack; MODP 89.2% on MultiviewX), outperforming TrackTacular.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining identity-consistent tracking across multiple cameras is challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions. While BEV fusion helps combat occlusion, projecting multi-view features into BEV can cause distortion and non-uniform density because object scale changes with distance, degrading detection/tracking quality.

Method: A three-part approach: (1) sparse transformation during BEV projection to avoid unnatural interpolation; (2) density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance; (3) a multi-view consistency loss encouraging each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.

Result: Quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance: IDF1 of 95.9% on WildTrack and MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, with clear gains over the TrackTacular baseline.

Conclusion: SCFusion effectively mitigates BEV projection limitations and provides a robust solution for accurate multi-view object detection and tracking across cameras.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

*Payal Varshney,Adriano Lucieri,Christoph Balada,Sheraz Ahmed,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LD-ViCE introduces latent-diffusion-based video counterfactual explanations to explain video-model decisions, improving semantic fidelity and temporal coherence while reducing computation; validated on EchoNet-Dynamic, FERV39k, and Something-Something V2 with strong quantitative and qualitative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting video-based AI decisions is challenging due to spatiotemporal complexity and model opacity. Existing explanations struggle with temporal coherence, robustness, and actionable causal insights; current counterfactual methods often ignore guidance from the target model, reducing fidelity and utility.

Method: Propose Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE). Exploit a state-of-the-art diffusion model in latent space to generate explanations, with an additional refinement step to ensure realism and interpretability. The approach is guided by the target model to improve semantic fidelity and practical usefulness, and demonstrates reduced computation compared to full-space diffusion.

Result: LD-ViCE outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 68% improvement in R2 score and halving inference time. Qualitative analyses indicate semantically meaningful and temporally coherent counterfactual explanations across three datasets: EchoNet-Dynamic, FERV39k, and Something-Something V2.

Conclusion: LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains by delivering efficient, coherent, and semantically faithful video counterfactual explanations, enabling better understanding and debugging of video-based models across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

### [28] [Beyond Distribution Shifts: Adaptive Hyperspectral Image Classification at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08436)
*Xia Yue,Anfeng Liu,Ning Chen,Chenjia Huang,Hui Liu,Zhou Huang,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTTA offers a unified robustness framework for hyperspectral image classification under various degradations, combining a multi-degradation benchmark, a spectral-spatial transformer with multi-scale receptive fields and label smoothing, and a confidence-aware test-time adaptation (CELA) that updates LayerNorm affine parameters via entropy minimization on high-confidence unlabeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classifiers are highly sensitive to distribution shifts from real-world degradations; need robust, data-efficient adaptation without source data or labels.

Method: 1) Build a nine-degradation HSI dataset. 2) Propose SSTC with multi-level receptive fields and label smoothing. 3) Introduce CELA: test-time adaptation updating only LayerNorm affine parameters by minimizing entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples.

Result: Demonstrates that HyperTTA outperforms baselines across diverse degradation scenarios on two benchmarks; validates both backbone and TTA approach; code to be released.

Conclusion: HyperTTA provides robust, flexible handling of distribution shifts in HSI classification without source data, leveraging dynamic TTA and strong feature extraction.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

### [29] [Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models for Conditional Cortical Thickness Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08442)
*Ivan Stoyanov,Fabian Bongratz,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SBDM, a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion model on the cortical surface to forecast vertex-level cortical thickness trajectories, leveraging a conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet) for denoising and multi-modal integration; demonstrates improved prediction accuracy and the ability to generate factual and counterfactual trajectories on ADNI and OASIS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, high-resolution, subject-specific CTh forecasting is challenged by the cortex's non-Euclidean geometry and the need to integrate multi-modal data; existing methods struggle with fine-grained predictions and scenario exploration. The work aims to enable precise, individualized trajectory forecasting and hypothetical scenario analysis on a spherical cortical manifold.

Method: Develops a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process on the sphere (SBDM) for vertex-level CTh forecasting. Introduces CoS-UNet, a denoising model that fuses spherical convolutions with dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions. The model forecasts trajectories and can generate factual and counterfactual trajectories on registered cortical surfaces, trained/evaluated on longitudinal ADNI and OASIS datasets.

Result: SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors compared with prior approaches on longitudinal ADNI and OASIS data. It also demonstrates the ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a framework for exploring hypothetical cortical development scenarios.

Conclusion: SBDM provides a novel, geometry-aware framework for high-resolution cortical thickness forecasting and counterfactual analysis, leveraging diffusion on the cortex and a specialized spherical U-Net for multi-modal integration. This approach advances individualized trajectory prediction and enables exploration of hypothetical cortical development, with demonstrated efficacy on established longitudinal datasets.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

*Yujie Zhu,Xinyi Zhang,Yekai Lu,Guang Yang,Faming Fang,Guixu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight super-resolution method using a First-order State Space Model (FSSM) improves MambaIR performance without adding parameters, achieving state-of-the-art results on five datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of state space models (SSMs) in vision, addressing the limited focus on the SSM module in Mamba-based vision models and leveraging token correlations to boost performance without increasing model size.

Method: Introduce a first-order state space model (FSSM) and apply a first-order hold condition to derive a new discretized form. Integrate FSSM into the MambaIR framework to enhance token correlation modeling without increasing parameter count, analyze cumulative error, and evaluate on lightweight super-resolution benchmarks.

Result: FSSM improves MambaIR on five benchmark datasets, surpassing current lightweight SR methods and achieving state-of-the-art results without adding parameters.

Conclusion: First-order state space modeling can effectively capture token correlations in vision tasks, boosting lightweight SR performance within the MambaIR framework and highlighting the potential of SSMs beyond network architecture design.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [31] [Maximally Useful and Minimally Redundant: The Key to Self Supervised Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08469)
*Yash Kumar Sharma,Vineet Nair,Wilson Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) to more-than-two views to tackle data imbalance by using a mutual-information-based objective that separates intra- and inter-class discriminative features; introduces a loss to filter extreme features; achieving state-of-the-art results on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSSL struggles on imbalanced data due to the reliance on two-view (positive/negative) cues; increasing the number of views and grounding the approach in mutual information can better capture and emphasize tail-class representations.

Method: The paper provides a mutual-information-based justification for multi-view objectives (>2 views). It introduces a loss that filters extreme features and promotes separation of intra- vs inter-class discriminative characteristics. It is applied to various self-supervised frameworks (contrastive and non-contrastive) and evaluated across imbalanced datasets using ResNet backbones.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification, e.g., 2% (Cifar10-LT, ResNet-18), 5% (Cifar100-LT, ResNet-18), 3% (Imagenet-LT-1k, ResNet-50).

Conclusion: A more-than-two-view objective grounded in mutual information improves CSSL under dataset imbalance, particularly by isolating tail-class information; the proposed loss helps suppress extreme features and improves tail-class representations across frameworks and datasets.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

*Kaleem Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents an end-to-end prompt-driven vision pipeline that unifies open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description, with transparent intermediate artifacts and interactive tooling; achieves high usable-mask rates (>90%) and >85% accuracy from a single-word prompt, while detailing practical tuning and runtime considerations to improve reliability in object editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce brittleness and fragmentation in multi-model vision systems by offering a reproducible, auditable workflow that can be driven by a single natural-language prompt and audited via intermediate artifacts.

Method: Develops a unified pipeline combining open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description, with end-to-end execution from a single prompt, artifact logging, and a UI/CLI interface. Highlights practical integration choices (thresholds, light morphology for masks, resource-aware defaults) and provides implementation guidelines for thresholds, mask tightness, diffusion parameters, version pinning, artifact logging, and seed control.

Result: Achieved usable masks in over 90% of cases with accuracy above 85% in a small one-word prompt segment. Inpainting consumes 60–75% of total runtime on a high-end GPU under typical settings. Provided actionable recommendations for tuning, logging, and repeatable runs to support reliable object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Conclusion: Offers a transparent, reliable blueprint for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single prompt, with guardrails and operational practices that enhance reliability and reproducibility of editing tasks.

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

### [34] [Chirality in Action: Time-Aware Video Representation Learning by Latent Straightening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08502)
*Piyush Bagad,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-supervised, time-sensitive video representation for chiral action recognition by adapting frozen image features via a perceptual-straightening–inspired autoencoder; achieves compact, time-aware representations that outperform larger models on Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade and improve standard benchmarks when combined with existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture temporal change in actions that are visually similar when reversed in time; many video embeddings fail to distinguish such chiral pairs, so there is a need for compact, linearly separable, time-aware representations trained with limited supervision.

Method: Self-supervised adaptation to inject time-sensitivity into a frozen feature sequence using an autoencoder with a latent space biased by perceptual straightening; learns to encode dynamic state changes (state, size, position, count) in a compact representation; evaluated on Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade datasets.

Result: Outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale datasets; improves downstream classification performance when fused with existing models across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Time-sensitive representations can be learned efficiently via self-supervised adaptation of frozen features, yielding compact encodings that improve chiral action recognition and generalize to standard benchmarks when combined with existing models.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuMo: a unified multimodal framework for human-centric video generation using text, image, and audio, featuring a two-stage training paradigm, a curated triplet dataset, and time-adaptive guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on sub-tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle two core issues in multimodal human video generation: (1) scarcity of training data with paired text, image, and audio triplets, and (2) difficulty coordinating subject preservation with audio-visual sync across heterogeneous modalities.

Method: 1) Build a high-quality dataset with paired text, reference images, and audio. 2) Two-stage progressive multimodal training with task-specific strategies. 3) Subject preservation via minimal-invasive image injection to keep prompt-following and generation abilities. 4) Audio-visual sync include audio cross-attention and a focus-by-predicting strategy to link audio to facial regions. 5) Progressive joint learning to incorporate audio-visual sync. 6) Inference uses a time-adaptive classifier-free guidance to adjust guidance weights over denoising steps.

Result: HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods on individual sub-tasks and establishes a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

Conclusion: HuMo demonstrates that a unified, collaborative multimodal control framework can effectively generate high-quality human videos from text, image, and audio inputs, with robust subject preservation and synchronized audio-visual dynamics, supported by a paired triplet dataset and progressive training.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

### [36] [MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in Large Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08538)
*Garry Yang,Zizhe Chen,Man Hon Wong,Haoyu Lei,Yongqiang Chen,Zhenguo Li,Kaiwen Zhou,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MESH is a QA-based benchmark to measure hallucinations in Large Video Models (LVMs) using a bottom-up, perception-aligned framework with target and trap instances; it reveals LVMs are strong on basic object recognition but prone to hallucinations for fine-grained details and multi-subject actions in longer videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks rely on manual categorization and neglect perceptual processes by which humans interpret videos; there is a need for a systematic, perception-aligned evaluation of LVM hallucinations.

Method: MESH uses a question-answering framework with binary and multiple-choice formats, incorporating target and trap instances. It evaluates in a bottom-up order: basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aiming to mirror human video understanding.

Result: MESH effectively identifies hallucinations and provides a comprehensive evaluation. Findings indicate LVMs perform well on recognizing basic objects and features but are substantially more prone to hallucinations when handling fine details or coordinating multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

Conclusion: MESH offers a robust, perception-aligned benchmark for detecting hallucinations in videos and can guide improvements in LVM reliability, particularly for complex, long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

*Robin-Nico Kampa,Fabian Deuser,Konrad Habel,Norbert Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view plant phenotyping approach uses a ViewSparsifier to learn view-invariant embeddings from 24 random views, achieving state-of-the-art results on Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation in the GroMo Grand Challenge; randomized 120-view selections are explored as future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view models miss information across views; multi-view data with varying heights and angles has redundancy and overlap. The goal is to learn representations that are robust to view variations to improve age and leaf-count estimation.

Method: Introduce ViewSparsifier to select 24 views randomly from 24 that form a selection vector, learn view-invariant embeddings for two tasks; use a multi-view GroMo dataset with multiple plants and five height levels; also experiment with selection matrices across 120 views.

Result: ViewSparsifier won both tasks (Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation).

Conclusion: View sparsification and randomized view selection offer a viable path for robust multi-view plant phenotyping; future research could optimize view selection across more heights (120 views) to further enhance performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

*Wenjun Yu,Yinchen Zhou,Jia-Xuan Jiang,Shubin Zeng,Yuee Li,Zhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal segmentation framework for medical images that uses EM-based semantic aggregation and a text-guided pixel decoder to bridge semantic gaps and reduce feature dispersion, achieving improved domain generalization on cardiac and fundus datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical multimodal segmentation suffers from a semantic gap between abstract prompts and fine-grained medical visuals, plus feature dispersion that harms cross-modal alignment. There is a need for robust fusion and better generalization across domains.

Method: 1) EM Aggregation: dynamically clusters features into compact semantic centers to tighten cross-modal correspondence. 2) Text-Guided Pixel Decoder: uses domain-invariant textual knowledge to steer deep visual representations, bridging semantic gap. 3) Synergistic integration of EM and text-guided decoding to enhance generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on public cardiac and fundus datasets show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Joint EM-based semantic aggregation and text-guided pixel decoding effectively reduce semantic mismatch and feature dispersion, leading to stronger generalization in medical multimodal segmentation.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

*Bayu Adhi Tama,Homayra Alam,Mostafa Cham,Omar Faruque,Jianwu Wang,Vandana Janeja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphTopoNet uses graph-based learning with uncertainty modeling to fuse sparse radar data and surface observables for Greenland subglacial bed mapping, achieving large error reductions while preserving fine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and uneven radar coverage leads to uncertain bed maps; improving maps is critical for sea-level projections and climate modeling.

Method: Build spatial graphs from surface observables augmented with gradient features and trends; use Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty; employ a hybrid loss that combines confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization; evaluate on three Greenland subregions against baselines.

Result: Outperforms interpolation, CNN, and graph baselines, reducing error by up to 60% and preserving fine-scale features.

Conclusion: Graph topology learning can transform sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into reliable, actionable bed maps at continental scales; supports operational climate forecasting and policy needs.

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

*Mathilde Monvoisin,Louise Piecuch,Blanche Texier,Cédric Hémon,Anaïs Barateau,Jérémie Huet,Antoine Nordez,Anne-Sophie Boureau,Jean-Claude Nunes,Diana Mateus*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to reduce manual segmentation workload in 3D medical imaging by using an implicit shape prior and informative-slice selection, enabling semi-automatic multi-organ segmentation from sparse annotations; validated on brain radiotherapy OARs and a sarcopenia muscle-shapes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of complex 3D medical images is time-consuming and error-prone, creating bottlenecks in treatment planning and disease assessment. There is a need for methods that reduce user interaction and extend to multi-organ segmentation and new data collection.

Method: The paper introduces an implicit shape prior to guide volume segmentation from sparse slice annotations, generalized to multi-organ segmentation, and a simple framework to automatically select the most informative slices to guide subsequent interactions.

Result: Experimental validation shows effectiveness on two use cases: assisted segmentation of organs-at-risk in brain cancer radiotherapy planning, and accelerating creation of a new muscle-shape database for sarcopenia.

Conclusion: The proposed approach reduces manual workload and interaction burden in complex 3D medical segmentation and has practical utility for radiotherapy planning and building morphometric databases for muscle degenerative diseases.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces EfficientIML for high-resolution diffusion-forgery localization using a lightweight EfficientRWKV backbone and multi-scale supervision, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy on a new 1200+ manipulation dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of exposure to diffusion-based forgeries in detectors trained on traditional datasets and the prohibitive computational costs of existing methods on high-resolution data.

Method: Proposes EfficientIML with a three-stage EfficientRWKV backbone that blends state-space models and attention to capture global context and local details, with multi-scale supervision across hierarchical predictions, trained/evaluated on a high-resolution SIF dataset with semantically extracted masks.

Result: Outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in localization performance, FLOPs, and inference speed on the dataset and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a lightweight, real-time-capable detector for diffusion-generated manipulations, suitable for practical forensic applications.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

### [42] [CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618)
*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Shahrooz Faghihroohi,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, automated prompting framework (CLAPS) integrates CLIP, GroundingDINO, and SAM for cross-modality retinal segmentation, achieving competitive performance across 12 datasets and 11 categories via modality-aware text prompts and automated spatial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome modality ambiguity in textual descriptions, eliminate manual prompting, and unify disparate retinal segmentation tasks into a single framework.

Method: Pre-train CLIP image encoder on a large multi-modal retinal dataset; use GroundingDINO to generate bounding-box prompts from local lesions; enhance text prompts with a modality signature; feed into SAM for segmentation; fully automated pipeline.

Result: Evaluated on 12 datasets across 11 categories; performance on par with specialist models; surpassing existing benchmarks on most metrics; demonstrates broad generalizability.

Conclusion: CLAPS offers a unified, automated foundation-model-based segmentation solution for retinal imaging with strong cross-dataset performance; potential to reduce manual effort and standardize workflows.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend evaluation of LLMs to data-rich, perception-heavy media (advertisements) that require understanding marketing logic, persuasion, and engagement, beyond surface visual content; promote diversified specialized tasks for knowledgeable LLMs.

Method: Construct AdsQA from 1,544 ad videos (10,962 clips, 22.7 hours) with 5 challenging QA tasks; propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1–styled RL model that reflects on questions and generates answers via reward-driven optimization; benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA.

Result: ReAd-R achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AdsQA provides a challenging, clue-rich test-bed for evaluating and advancing LLM capabilities in video understanding and reasoning; reward-driven RL can enhance LLM-based video QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain

### [44] [UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image Diagnosis Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08624)
*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Daniel Zapp,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unpaired multimodal framework UOPSL uses OCT-derived spatial priors to guide fundus-based ophthalmic disease recognition, bridging unpaired fundus and OCT data via extended disease text; it learns a predilection-sites matrix through contrastive learning on unpaired images and achieves state-of-the-art results across 9 datasets and 28 classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite significant AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis progress, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic data is expensive. Fundus photography is cheap but OCT data is limited and there is a modality imbalance. Conventional fundus-only or text-only approaches fail to capture fine-grained spatial cues that different modalities reveal about lesion sites.

Method: Proposes an unpaired multimodal framework named UOPSL that uses extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to identify predilection sites and thus enhance fundus-based disease recognition. It bridges unpaired fundus and OCT via extended disease text descriptions. It employs contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning a predilection-sites matrix in the OCT latent space, capturing lesion localization patterns. During fine-tuning/inference with only fundus images (no paired OCT), it drops OCT input and uses the predilection-sites matrix to assist fundus classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 diverse datasets across 28 categories show that the framework outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that OCT-derived spatial priors, learned in an unpaired setting, can significantly boost fundus-based ophthalmic disease recognition and offers a viable path for leveraging scarce multimodal data in medical imaging.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADB uses partial supervision to bridge domain gaps in diffusion models via latent alignment, enabling deterministic sample-to-sample translation with mixed paired/unpaired data and multi-source/target extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and costly paired data hinder diffusion models; there is a need for scalable semi-supervised domain translation that preserves fidelity and controllability without full supervision.

Method: Aligns source and target distributions in a shared latent space by connecting a pretrained source-domain diffusion model with a target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM) trained on partially paired latent representations; uses a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target couplings to achieve deterministic domain mapping; extends to multi-source and multi-target translation tasks.

Result: Demonstrates superior depth-to-image translation under partial supervision; extends the approach to multi-source translation (e.g., depth maps and segmentation masks) and multi-target style transfer; shows versatility across diverse domain gaps.

Conclusion: LADB offers a scalable, versatile solution for real-world domain translation under incomplete annotations, balancing fidelity and diversity by leveraging partially paired data instead of requiring full supervision or purely unpaired mappings.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

TL;DR: A dual-reference, dual-stream network (DSLNet) decouples morphology and trajectory in ISLR using wrist-centric shape and facial-centric trajectory representations, processed by a topology-aware GCN and a Finsler-geometry encoder, fused via a geometry-driven OT, achieving state-of-the-art on WLASL-100/300/LSA64 with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morphologically similar but semantically distinct gestures cause geometry-based ambiguity; single-frame methods fail to capture both shape and motion; need dual-reference coordinate systems to disambiguate.

Method: Dual-stream architecture: wrist-centric frame for morphology with topology-aware graph convolution; facial-centric frame for trajectory with a Finsler geometry-based encoder; fusion via a geometry-driven optimal transport mechanism.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracies: 93.70% (WLASL-100), 89.97% (WLASL-300), 99.79% (LSA64); fewer parameters than competing models.

Conclusion: Decoupling morphology and trajectory via dual-reference representations improves ISLR performance and efficiency; DSLNet sets a new baseline and offers a path for more geometry-aware ISLR models.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FractalPINN-Flow is an unsupervised dense optical flow method that uses a fractal-inspired, nested encoder-decoder (FDN) and a TV-regularized variational objective to produce accurate, smooth, edge-preserving flows on high-resolution data with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for dense optical flow estimation without ground-truth supervision, leveraging a fractal-like architecture to capture multi-scale, self-similar motion patterns and long-range dependencies where conventional CNNs struggle, especially in high-resolution and low-label scenarios.

Method: Proposes Fractal Deformation Network (FDN): a recursive encoder-decoder with skip connections inspired by fractal geometry; unsupervised training via an energy functional combining L1/L2 data fidelity terms (brightness constancy) and a total variation (TV) regularization to promote smooth, coherent flow fields.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrates that FractalPINN-Flow yields accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow fields, performing well on high-resolution data and settings with limited annotations.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective unsupervised approach for dense optical flow by integrating a fractal-inspired multi-scale architecture with a TV-regularized variational objective, enabling high-resolution, coherent flow estimation without ground-truth labels.

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Method: Systematic survey of CI methods (e.g., light field imaging, HDR imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, glare mitigation) and their relationships to core CV tasks (object detection, depth estimation, optical flow, face recognition, keypoint detection); analysis of synergies, practical contributions, opportunities, challenges, and directions; discussion of task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines for robust CV in real-world contexts.

Result: A mapped landscape of CI-CV interactions identifying opportunities, challenges, and actionable directions; a framework for developing task-aware imaging pipelines with improved robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: CI will continue to transform CV by enabling robust perception under challenging conditions; future work should emphasize integration of CI pipelines with CV tasks, focusing on adaptive, task-specific imaging to enhance autonomy, surveillance, AR, and robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)

reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need for energy-efficient, scalable, and deployable multimodal models in resource-constrained environments as MLLMs grow larger.

Method: Develop BreezeCLIP as a compact vision-language encoder and integrate it into a Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model (BcQLM) for end-to-end visual question answering. Emphasizes modular, extensible design for generalization to broader multimodal tasks with about 1.2B parameters.

Result: Significant reductions in computational cost with performance on par with standard-size MLLMs; validated across multiple datasets, showing a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: BcQLM with BreezeCLIP offers a practical path toward deployable, high-performance MLLMs under hardware constraints; source code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source
code is available at https://github.com/thico0224/BcQLM.

### [51] [CrowdQuery: Density-Guided Query Module for Enhanced 2D and 3D Detection in Crowded Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08738)
*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrowdQuery introduces a density-aware module that embeds object density maps into transformer-based detectors, improving 2D and 3D crowd detection and bridging the 2D/3D gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowded scenes are challenging for detectors; existing density maps rely on head positions or object statistics and do not incorporate bounding box dimensions or bridge 2D/3D detection.

Method: Predict and embed a density map via the CQ module, integrate density information into object queries/decoder; redefine density maps to include bounding box sizes; develop CQ2D and CQ3D architectures; applicable to various transformer models.

Result: Significant improvements on STCrowd in both 2D and 3D, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods; additional gains when integrated into a leading crowd detector on CrowdHuman; code released publicly.

Conclusion: Density-guided, bounding-box-aware queries generalize across 2D and 3D transformer-based detectors, enabling a unified approach to crowd detection without extra data and bridging the 2D/3D gap.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at
https://github.com/mdaehl/CrowdQuery.

### [52] [ArgoTweak: Towards Self-Updating HD Maps through Structured Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08764)
*Lena Wild,Rafael Valencia,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak introduces the first dataset providing the triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data to support self-verifying and self-updating HD maps, using a bijective mapping framework for fine-grained, interpretable map changes; shows reduced sim2real gap vs synthetic priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets with realistic map priors are missing, hindering reliable prior integration for HD mapping. A realistic triplet enables better sim2real transfer and explainability.

Method: A bijective mapping framework that decomposes large-scale map edits into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level for interpretability. Includes a map modification toolbox and a change-detection/integration pipeline trained on ArgoTweak; provides a complete triplet (prior maps, current maps, sensor data).

Result: Training on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared with synthetic priors. Ablations show strong impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations on performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: ArgoTweak sets a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping and enables scalable, self-improving mapping. It provides datasets, baselines, toolboxes, and resources to foster further research.

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

### [53] [Calibrating MLLM-as-a-judge via Multimodal Bayesian Prompt Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08777)
*Eric Slyman,Mehrab Tanjim,Kushal Kafle,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMB proposes a multimodal aware Bayesian prompt ensemble that uses image clustering to adapt prompt weights, improving calibration and alignment in TTI judge tasks over standard ensembling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal judge models suffer from bias, overconfidence, and cross-domain inconsistency; unimodal ensembling fails to generalize to TTI; there is a need for reliable evaluation of TTI systems.

Method: Bayesian prompt ensemble augmented by image clustering; dynamic assignment of prompt weights per sample based on visual features; a multimodal mixture model.

Result: Improved accuracy in pairwise preferences; significantly better calibration; outperforms baselines on HPSv2 and MJBench; alignment with human annotations across varied image content.

Conclusion: Multimodal-specific prompt ensembling is crucial for reliable judge calibration; MMB offers a promising path for scalable, trustworthy TTI evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

### [54] [An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Arsenicosis Diagnosis Using Mobile-Captured Skin Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08780)
*Asif Newaz,Asif Ur Rahman Adib,Rajit Sahil,Mashfique Mehzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study proposes an end-to-end mobile-image-based arsenicosis diagnosis framework using Transformer models, achieving 86% accuracy (Swin Transformer) on ~11k images across 20 classes, with LIME/Grad-CAM interpretability and external validation, suggesting practical, explainable screening in rural settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arsenicosis is a major public health issue in South/Southeast Asia. Early cutaneous signs are underdiagnosed, especially in rural areas with limited dermatology access. Automated image-based tools can enable non-invasive, accessible screening.

Method: Curated dataset of 11,000+ images across 20 classes (arsenic-induced and other skin conditions). Evaluated multiple deep learning architectures (CNNs and Transformer-based models). Implemented model interpretability with LIME and Grad-CAM. Demonstrated deployment via a web-based diagnostic tool using mobile-captured skin images.

Result: Transformer models outperformed CNNs, with Swin Transformer achieving 86% accuracy. LIME and Grad-CAM confirmed lesion-relevant focus. External validation showed good generalization beyond the training data.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable arsenicosis diagnosis from mobile images, offering a practical diagnostic aid to support early detection and intervention in resource-limited communities.

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

### [55] [Quantifying Accuracy of an Event-Based Star Tracker via Earth's Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08794)
*Dennis Melamed,Connor Hashemi,Scott McCloskey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based cameras can be used for star-tracking attitude estimation with Earth's rotation as ground truth. The approach yields RMSE of 18.47 arcseconds and a second error metric of ~78.84 arcseconds when compared to IERS Earth orientation, suggesting promise for low-cost, low-latency tracking. Code and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truthing real-data star-tracking with event cameras is challenging. The Earth's rotation provides a highly regular, precisely measurable reference (to milli-arcseconds). Using this natural reference allows objective evaluation of EBC-based attitude estimates against IERS Earth orientation data.

Method: Keep the event camera static and aligned with a ground-based telescope, allowing Earth's rotation to be the sole motion in the celestial frame. Process the event stream to estimate orientation in the celestial reference frame and compare against IERS Earth orientation measurements. Report RMSE and a secondary error metric.

Result: The EBC system achieves a root mean squared error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about/error metric of 78.84 arcseconds when compared to IERS Earth orientation. The authors also highlight benefits of EBCs (sparse data, high dynamic range, low power, fast updates) and provide code/data for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Event cameras show potential for low-cost, low-latency star tracking with competitive accuracy when ground truth is derived from Earth's rotation. The work provides a reproducible evaluation framework by aligning EBC estimates with IERS references and releasing code/data.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

*Matthieu Vilain,Rémi Giraud,Yannick Berthoumieu,Guillaume Bourmaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER introduces multi-hypothesis dense matching with beam search and cross-attention, improving robustness to depth discontinuities and large zooms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense matching with a single hypothesis struggles when correspondences are widely spread due to depth changes or zoom, causing incorrect matches.

Method: Predict multiple correspondences per source pixel at each scale, propagate them via beam search, and integrate them into cross-attention layers; build BEAMER architecture that maintains multiple hypotheses across scales.

Result: Demonstrates significantly improved robustness over state-of-the-art, especially at depth discontinuities or strong zoom-ins.

Conclusion: Allowing multiple hypotheses to propagate across scales yields more reliable dense matches; BEAMER is a robust alternative to coarse-to-fine single-hypothesis methods.

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

*Jenna Kang,Maria Silva,Patsorn Sangkloy,Kenneth Chen,Niall Williams,Qi Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces GeneVA, a large-scale, annotated dataset to benchmark and improve spatio-temporal artifacts in text-driven video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative video models have inherent randomness causing artifacts (e.g., inconsistent physics, temporal instability). Existing benchmarks focus on static images, lacking spatio-temporal benchmarks for videos.

Method: Curate a large-scale artifact dataset of videos generated from natural text prompts and provide rich human annotations targeting spatio-temporal artifacts.

Result: The GeneVA dataset is introduced, enabling benchmarking of model performance and guiding improvements in generative video quality.

Conclusion: GeneVA offers a resource to standardize evaluation and drive progress in reducing spatio-temporal artifacts in text-conditioned video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

### [58] [RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826)
*Jie Wu,Yu Gao,Zilyu Ye,Ming Li,Liang Li,Hanzhong Guo,Jie Liu,Zeyue Xue,Xiaoxia Hou,Wei Liu,Yan Zeng,Weilin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardDance introduces a scalable, generative reward paradigm for visual generation RM, aligning rewards with Vision-Language Models; enables scaling to 26B parameters and context-rich prompts; mitigates reward hacking and improves diversity and quality across text-to-image/video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RM scaling for visual generation is hampered by CLIP-based RMs' architectural/input constraints, misalignment of Bradley-Terry losses with next-token prediction in VLMs, and persistent reward hacking in RLHF. A scalable, aligned reward signal compatible with VLMs is needed to improve quality, diversity, and stability.

Method: Formulate the reward as the probability that the model outputs a 'yes' token, indicating the generated image outperforms a reference per specified criteria. This generative reward aligns with VLM architectures and supports model scaling (up to 26B params) and context scaling (task instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought).

Result: Empirical results show RewardDance surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Large RMs maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, resisting reward hacking and alleviating mode collapse in smaller models.

Conclusion: RewardDance provides a scalable, robust reward modeling framework that aligns rewards with VLMs, enabling large-scale RMs and context-rich guidance while mitigating reward hacking and promoting diverse, high-quality outputs.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

TL;DR: Presents a single-video monocular RGB pipeline that reconstructs 3D dynamic cloth and estimates appearance for physically-based rendering using cloth simulation and differentiable rendering, with two new depth-regularization terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth ambiguity makes accurate 3D reconstruction of dynamic fabrics hard; overcoming this with a joint geometry–appearance pipeline enables realistic rendering from a single video.

Method: Pipeline combines physical cloth simulation with differentiable rendering. Introduces two novel regularization terms to the 3D reconstruction to reduce depth ambiguity. Operates on a single monocular RGB video and outputs both a deforming 3D fabric model and an appearance estimate for high-quality renderings.

Result: The method reduces 3D reconstruction error by a factor of 2.64 compared to recent methods and attains a medium runtime of about 30 minutes per scene. The motion is sufficiently accurate to estimate appearance and recover sharp details from the single video.

Conclusion: A feasible framework for jointly reconstructing dynamic 3D fabric geometry and appearance from monocular video, leveraging cloth physics and differentiable rendering, with improved reconstruction plausibility due to two depth-regularization terms and practical runtime.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Conclusion: Density-matrix approach is a promising direction for scalable quantum-inspired swarm modeling; suggests concrete future research directions.

Abstract: In a robotic swarm, parameters such as position and proximity to the target
can be described in terms of probability amplitudes. This idea led to recent
studies on a quantum approach to the definition of the swarm, including a
block-matrix representation. Here, we propose an advancement of the idea,
defining a swarm as a mixed quantum state, to be described with a density

TL;DR: Major update to PySensors adding spatial constraints, custom basis inputs, a thermodynamic landscape view of sensor configurations, regularized reconstruction, uncertainty heat maps, and usage examples/roadmap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address practical deployment needs: enforce regional sensor counts, integrate fixed or pre-determined locations, ensure sensor diversity via minimum distance, support arbitrary bases, and quantify reconstruction uncertainty to guide deployment decisions.

Method: Introduce spatially constrained placement algorithms; allow predetermined locations and distance constraints; accept custom basis inputs; develop a thermodynamic-like landscape mapping of sensor interactions; formulate regularized least squares for robust reconstruction handling under/over-sampling; quantify noise-induced uncertainty with visual heat maps; provide code examples and deployment guidance.

Result: Extended PySensors capabilities enabling constrained, customizable sensor selection with robust reconstruction and uncertainty visualization; groundwork for integration with external criteria and broader deployment guidance.

Conclusion: The update broadens applicability of PySensors to more realistic sensing scenarios and sets the stage for further extensions and evaluation across domains; emphasizes decision-support through uncertainty visualization and a full interaction landscape.

Abstract: PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of
sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to
\texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement
capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact
sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations,
and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to
support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or
spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a
single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of
sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view
facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment
of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for
over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares
approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced
uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual
uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these
additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and
theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new
features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for
implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a
roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality
and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

TL;DR: A novel SVN-ICP algorithm using Stein Variational Newton on manifolds for fusing LiDAR odometry in multisensor setups, providing automatic uncertainty estimation without explicit noise modeling, and integrating with an IMU in an error-state Kalman filter; it shows improved performance and reliable uncertainty across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust, uncertainty-aware LiDAR odometry fusion in multisensor systems, especially under LiDAR degradation, with minimal manual tuning and explicit noise modeling.

Method: SVN-ICP approximates the posterior with particles via Stein Variational Inference on a manifold, enabling automatic inference of pose and noise parameters; integrated into an error-state Kalman filter with an IMU for evaluation.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets across diverse environments and robot types, providing reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: SVN-ICP delivers accurate pose estimation with automatic noise-parameter inference, robustness to degraded LiDAR, and trustworthy uncertainty quantification, reducing the need for manual noise modeling and tuning.

Abstract: This letter introduces SVN-ICP, a novel Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
algorithm with uncertainty estimation that leverages Stein Variational Newton
(SVN) on manifold. Designed specifically for fusing LiDAR odometry in
multisensor systems, the proposed method ensures accurate pose estimation and
consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By
approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein
Variational Inference framework, SVN-ICP eliminates the need for explicit noise
modeling or manual parameter tuning. To evaluate its effectiveness, we
integrate SVN-ICP into a simple error-state Kalman filter alongside an IMU and
test it across multiple datasets spanning diverse environments and robot types.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
best-in-class methods on challenging scenarios while providing reliable

*Lamiaa H. Zain,Raafat E. Shalaby*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Three end-to-end CNNs (NetConEmb, NetEmb, NetGated) were trained and evaluated for real-time obstacle avoidance on a differential-drive robot using synchronized RGB-D data from a RealSense D415. NetConEmb performed best offline and in real-time, NetEmb offered a lighter model with comparable RMSE but limited generalization, and NetGated struggled in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust, real-time obstacle avoidance in complex and unknown environments by learning from RGB-D sensor data and generating low-level steering commands; compare architectures to balance accuracy, model size, and generalization.

Method: Train and evaluate three CNN architectures (NetConEmb, NetEmb, NetGated) offline on synchronized color and depth images from an Intel RealSense D415 and deploy on a differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance. Metrics include MedAE (rad/s) and RMSE (rad/s). Environments include known and unknown settings to assess generalization.

Result: Offline, NetConEmb achieved the best performance with MedAE = 0.58×10^-3 rad/s. NetEmb (≈25% fewer parameters, faster convergence) achieved RMSE = 21.68×10^-3 rad/s, close to NetConEmb’s 21.42×10^-3 rad/s. In real-time navigation, NetConEmb had 100% success in both known and unknown environments, while NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in the known environment.

Conclusion: NetConEmb is the most robust and generalizable model for end-to-end obstacle avoidance in both known and unknown environments; NetEmb offers a lighter, faster alternative with comparable RMSE but weaker generalization; NetGated underperforms in unknown environments. The results highlight trade-offs between model size, convergence speed, and generalization for real-time robotics applications.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,
achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while
NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.

*Ruijie Du,Ruoyu Lin,Yanning Shen,Magnus Egerstedt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-robot framework for online learning and coverage in an unknown, potentially time-varying density field, using Random Feature GP (RFGP) and online RFGP (O-RFGP) with Voronoi coverage and UCB sampling; theory and simulations/experiments show effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPs struggle with online, scalable learning in dynamic, unknown domains; need online incremental inference and region-focused sampling for efficient multi-robot coverage.

Method: Employ Random Features GP to approximate GP regression; use online RFGP for incremental updates; integrate with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling to guide robot deployment and data collection; provide theoretical guarantees; validate with simulations (time-invariant) and time-varying settings including a physical experiment.

Result: Demonstrates adaptive, information-driven coverage and learning; theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions; empirical validation via simulations and a real-world experiment showing effectiveness in time-varying scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective, theoretically grounded simultaneous learning and coverage by a robot team in unknown, possibly time-varying fields, leveraging online GP approximations and UCB-guided sampling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform
simultaneous learning and coverage of the domain of interest characterized by
an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the
limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP
(RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental
inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus
on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient
coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and
evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios.
Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through
additional simulations and a physical experiment.

### [65] [Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robot Grasp Detection with Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08126)
*Houjian Yu,Zheming Zhou,Min Sun,Omid Ghasemalizadeh,Yuyin Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo,Arnie Sen,Changhyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework (OGRG) enables grounding objects specified by open-form natural language and predicting planar grasp poses, even with duplicated objects, using a bi-directional vision-language fusion and depth cues; it supports both fully supervised Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS) and weakly supervised Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA), achieving real-time performance and superior grounding/grasping over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to interpret open-form natural language expressions to ground target objects and predict grasps in cluttered scenes, addressing duplicates and reducing reliance on costly pixel-perfect annotations.

Method: Introduce Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG) with a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and depth integration for enhanced geometric reasoning. Study two settings: (1) RGS with pixel-wise full supervision; (2) RGA with weak supervision using only single-pixel grasp annotations. Tailored grounding and grasp prediction modules are designed to handle duplicates and assign stable poses.

Result: OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial language. It runs at 17.59 FPS on an RTX 2080 Ti, enabling potential closed-loop or multi-object sequential grasping, and achieves superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy in RGS. In weakly supervised RGA, it surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation and real-robot trials.

Conclusion: OGRG provides robust grounding and planar grasping from open-form language in the presence of duplicate objects, with real-time performance and effectiveness across supervised and weakly supervised settings, highlighting the value of bi-directional vision-language fusion and depth-enhanced spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is
essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant
challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language
expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.
Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both
object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object
Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets
open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target
objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated
object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp
Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp
Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp
annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion
module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,
improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that
OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial
language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential
grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy
compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA
setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation
and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning
design. Project page: https://z.umn.edu/ogrg

### [66] [Mean Field Game-Based Interactive Trajectory Planning Using Physics-Inspired Unified Potential Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08147)
*Zhen Tian,Fujiang Yuan,Chunhong Yuan,Yanhong Peng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a unified interaction-aware potential field framework (IUPF) that blends style-specific benefit and risk fields within a physics-inspired variational model based on mean field game theory to enable safe, smooth, and scalable interactive trajectory planning without extra safety modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory planners often incur high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. There is a need to model diverse driving styles (conservative, aggressive, cooperative) in a scalable, safe way.

Method: Introduce Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields via a physics-inspired variational model grounded in mean field game theory. Uses stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence, enabling modeling of conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules.

Result: Simulations on lane changing and overtaking show that IUPF maintains safe distances, produces smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in adaptability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IUPF provides a scalable, safe, and behavior-aware trajectory planning framework without extra safety modules, achieving reliable equilibrium behavior and improved computational performance in interactive driving scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive trajectory planning in autonomous driving must balance safety,
efficiency, and scalability under heterogeneous driving behaviors. Existing
methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics.
To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field
(IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a
physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The
approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without
additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to
guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane
changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances,
generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional
optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and
computational efficiency.

### [67] [Risk-Bounded Multi-Agent Visual Navigation via Dynamic Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08157)
*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RB-CBS extends Conflict-Based Search with per-agent risk budgeting to trade safety for speed in multi-agent navigation, using a GCRL-derived graph and iterative risk allocation to stay within a global safety bound Delta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overly conservative graph-pruning in GCRL-based multi-agent planning that sacrifices mission efficiency, by allowing flexible, per-agent risk budgets within a total safety constraint.

Method: Integrate risk budgeting into CBS (RB-CBS). Build a graph from replay buffer states via goal-conditioned RL, prune obviously unsafe edges, then during CBS search allocate a global risk budget Delta across agents; assign local delta budgets delta_i to agents; iteratively adjust allocations to meet overall Delta while maximizing path efficiency; ensure collision-free planning under risk constraints.

Result: Experimental results show the iterative risk-allocation framework yields better performance in complex environments, enabling multiple agents to find collision-free paths within the user-specified Delta, compared to overly conservative pruning.

Conclusion: Dynamic, per-agent risk budgeting enables more efficient navigation without violating overall safety, reducing conservatism of prior graph-pruning approaches and improving multi-agent planning under risk constraints.

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

*Steven Yang,Xiaoyu Tian,Kshitij Goel,Wennie Tabib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Lightweight zero-shot metric depth from monocular RGB+IMU for collision avoidance, using monotonic spline rescaling of relative depth from a VINS-sparse 3D map; deployed on a quadrotor at 15 Hz with successful collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need metric depth for autonomous flight collision avoidance without expensive sensors or heavy fine-tuning; monocular methods provide only relative depth and may require domain-specific adaptation.

Method: Create a sparse 3D feature map with a visual-inertial navigation system (VINS); apply several lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to turn relative depth into metric depth; compare strategies across diverse simulated environments; select the best approach (monotonic spline fitting) and deploy on a compute-constrained quadrotor to obtain metric depth at 15 Hz.

Result: Among strategies, monotonic spline fitting performed best; achieved on-board metric depth at 15 Hz; demonstrated collision avoidance in real-world experiments after integrating with a motion-primitives-based planner.

Conclusion: Zero-shot depth rescaling via monotonic spline fitting enables practical metric-depth estimation from monocular RGB+IMU for collision avoidance on resource-constrained platforms, reducing reliance on heavy sensors or task-specific fine-tuning and enabling real-time planning.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

### [69] [Diffusion-Guided Multi-Arm Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08160)
*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DG-MAP combines diffusion models with MAPF-inspired decomposition to scale multi-arm planning. It uses two conditional diffusion models—one for single-arm trajectories and one for dual-arm dynamics for pairwise collision resolution—reducing data needs and improving scalability across team sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-arm motion planning in shared spaces suffers from exponential state-space growth and high data requirements for learned models, limiting scalability to larger teams and long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduce two conditional diffusion models: (1) a single-arm trajectory generator, and (2) a dual-arm dynamics model for resolving pairwise collisions. These are embedded within a MAPF-inspired structured decomposition that decouples planning into single-agent planning plus collision resolution, enabling scalable planning as the number of arms grows.

Result: Empirical evaluations against other learning-based methods across varying team sizes show improved effectiveness and practical applicability, with reduced reliance on massive multi-arm datasets.

Conclusion: DG-MAP offers a scalable, data-efficient framework for multi-arm planning in shared environments by leveraging diffusion-based generative models within a MAPF-like decomposition, suitable for larger arm teams and long-horizon tasks; a project site is provided for details.

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-based quadrotor navigation using differentiable simulation, privileged time-of-arrival maps, and yaw alignment loss to navigate around large obstacles; achieves 86% simulated success and 20 real flights with 589 m and no collisions, outperforming baselines by 34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of learning-based quadrotor planners in scenes with large obstacles or walls blocking the goal; leverage privileged information (ToA maps) and yaw alignment to improve obstacle negotiation.

Method: Train a reinforcement learning policy in an efficient differentiable simulator; introduce time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged information; add a yaw alignment loss; evaluate in photo-realistic simulations with large obstacles; deploy onboard a quadrotor in outdoor environments across 20 flights.

Result: 86% success rate in simulation; 34% improvement over baselines; 20 real flights, 589 m flown with no collisions, speeds up to 4 m/s.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves robustness of quadrotor navigation around large obstacles, transferring from simulation to real-world deployment by leveraging privileged ToA information and yaw-alignment guidance.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the
day and night. The policy is validated across 20 flights, covering 589 meters
without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic SLAM methods model static and dynamic scene components but are computationally expensive, limiting online applicability.

Method: Develops a novel factor-graph formulation and system architecture designed to leverage incremental solvers for online estimation of camera pose and object motion.

Result: On multiple datasets, achieves equal or better pose and object-motion accuracy compared to state-of-the-art; demonstrates scalability and yields about a 5x speed-up over existing methods.

Conclusion: The formulation is well-suited to incremental solvers and, with the proposed architecture, enables scalable, online Dynamic SLAM.

Abstract: Dynamic SLAM methods jointly estimate for the static and dynamic scene
components, however existing approaches, while accurate, are computationally
expensive and unsuitable for online applications. In this work, we present the
first application of incremental optimisation techniques to Dynamic SLAM. We
introduce a novel factor-graph formulation and system architecture designed to
take advantage of existing incremental optimisation methods and support online
estimation. On multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves equal
to or better than state-of-the-art in camera pose and object motion accuracy.
We further analyse the structural properties of our approach to demonstrate its
scalability and provide insight regarding the challenges of solving Dynamic
SLAM incrementally. Finally, we show that our formulation results in problem

*Elahe Delavari,Feeza Khan Khanzada,Jaerock Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematic survey of ~100 RL papers in CARLA for autonomous driving; finds dominance of model-free methods, heterogeneous state/action/reward choices, common evaluation metrics and benchmarks; highlights key challenges and proposes directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consolidated view of how RL is currently used, benchmarked, and evaluated in CARLA-based autonomous driving; a taxonomy and statistics are needed to guide research and deployment.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of peer‑reviewed CARLA RL works; categorized by algorithmic family (model-free, model-based, hierarchical, hybrid); extracted state, action, reward formulations; compiled evaluation metrics and benchmark settings; synthesized challenges and future directions.

Result: Provided unified taxonomy; quantified prevalence (e.g., >80% model-free with DQN/PPO/SAC); mapped sensor modalities and control abstractions; enumerated common metrics (success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and typical CARLA town/scenario/traffic setups; identified gaps and promising avenues.

Conclusion: This review serves as a reference and roadmap for newcomers and for advancing RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment; highlights model-based RL, meta-learning, and richer multi-agent simulations as promising directions and underscores persistent issues like sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety, and behavior diversity.

Abstract: Autonomous-driving research has recently embraced deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) as a promising framework for data-driven decision making, yet a clear
picture of how these algorithms are currently employed, benchmarked and
evaluated is still missing. This survey fills that gap by systematically
analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL
policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the
literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and
hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of
existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC.
Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted
across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV,
semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs.
continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also
consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics
(success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns,
scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent
challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees
and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research
questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and
richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy,
quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review
aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing
RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.

*Yoshiki Kanai,Akira Kanazawa,Hideyuki Ichiwara,Hiroshi Ito,Naoaki Noguchi,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sensorless, low-cost bilateral teleoperation with a simple feedback controller in leader-follower setups; robust contact stability, minimal tuning, zero-parameter hardware implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate contact sensing is crucial for force-feedback teleoperation, but traditional bilateral systems rely on force sensors and complex control, hindering deployment on affordable hardware. The aim is to enable effective force feedback without sensors, broadening accessibility.

Method: Proposes a bilateral teleoperation approach using only a simple feedback controller, in a leader-follower configuration, compatible with low-cost hardware; requires no force sensors and zero parameter adjustments, maintaining robustness even at low update rates.

Result: Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments, the method shows high operability and contact stability, outperforms conventional methods, minimal parameter tuning, robust to low communication cycle rates; demonstrated on two types of commercially available hardware with zero parameter changes.

Conclusion: This approach eases implementation, extends force feedback teleoperation to low-cost hardware, enabling broader use and advancing contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

Abstract: Effective data collection in contact-rich manipulation requires force
feedback during teleoperation, as accurate perception of contact is crucial for
stable control. However, such technology remains uncommon, largely because
bilateral teleoperation systems are complex and difficult to implement. To
overcome this, we propose a bilateral teleoperation method that relies only on
a simple feedback controller and does not require force sensors. The approach
is designed for leader-follower setups using low-cost hardware, making it
broadly applicable. Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments,
we demonstrate that the method requires minimal parameter tuning, yet achieves
both high operability and contact stability, outperforming conventional
approaches. Furthermore, we show its high robustness: even at low communication
cycle rates between leader and follower, control performance degradation is
minimal compared to high-speed operation. We also prove our method can be
implemented on two types of commercially available low-cost hardware with zero
parameter adjustments. This highlights its high ease of implementation and
versatility. We expect this method will expand the use of force feedback
teleoperation systems on low-cost hardware. This will contribute to advancing
contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

*Sheng Zhong,Junkai Niu,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Stereo-DEVO: a learning-based stereo event VO with a static-stereo depth association and BA, enabling real-time, metric-scale pose estimation on VGA data and robust nighttime HDR performance, outperforming existing event-VO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliability of handcrafted data association in event-based VO under low-light HDR with wide dynamic range and varying noise; leverage deep networks for robust depth and pose estimation.

Method: Extend DEVO with a static-stereo association strategy for sparse depth; integrate into tightly-coupled bundle adjustment; use a recurrent network to estimate dense optical flow via voxel-based event representations to enable reliable patch associations.

Result: Achieves high-precision metric-scale poses; real-time on VGA; validated on multiple datasets; superior to state-of-the-art event VO; stable in nighttime HDR scenarios.

Conclusion: Stereo-DEVO demonstrates versatile, robust performance of learning-based stereo event VO in challenging HDR/nighttime settings, with real-time capability.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently
and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution,
offering the potential to handle state estimation tasks involving motion blur
and high dynamic range (HDR) illumination conditions. However, the versatility
of event-based visual odometry (VO) relying on handcrafted data association
(either direct or indirect methods) is still unreliable, especially in field
robot applications under low-light HDR conditions, where the dynamic range can
be enormous and the signal-to-noise ratio is spatially-and-temporally varying.
Leveraging deep neural networks offers new possibilities for overcoming these
challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based stereo event visual
odometry. Building upon Deep Event Visual Odometry (DEVO), our system (called
Stereo-DEVO) introduces a novel and efficient static-stereo association
strategy for sparse depth estimation with almost no additional computational
burden. By integrating it into a tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA)
optimization scheme, and benefiting from the recurrent network's ability to
perform accurate optical flow estimation through voxel-based event
representations to establish reliable patch associations, our system achieves
high-precision pose estimation in metric scale. In contrast to the offline
performance of DEVO, our system can process event data of \zs{Video Graphics
Array} (VGA) resolution in real time. Extensive evaluations on multiple public
real-world datasets and self-collected data justify our system's versatility,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art event-based VO
methods. More importantly, our system achieves stable pose estimation even in
large-scale nighttime HDR scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL), a sample-efficient, real-time capable Koopman-based learning pipeline with complexity independent of dataset size and convergence guarantees; validated on robotics hardware and simulations, achieving <10% data compared to benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven control methods struggle with large data demands and slow real-time updates, especially on hardware with limited data and computation. A lightweight, quickly updatable approach is needed.

Method: Introduces Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL): a recursive updating scheme for Koopman representations with formal convergence conditions and algorithmic analysis; complexity is independent of dataset size; validated on a simulated planar two-link arm and hardware with soft actuators; high-performance C++ open-source implementation.

Result: RKL enables real-time recursive model updates, improving sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis; uses less than 10% of the data required by benchmarks; complexity does not grow with dataset size.

Conclusion: RKL offers a practical, provably convergent, lightweight Koopman-based learning pipeline for real-time control, suitable for hardware-constrained, data-scarce environments; code is openly available.

Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited --
such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require
large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their
performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents
nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman
representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting
with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly
sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning
(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide
formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and
fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a
simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the
sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --
requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed game-theoretic framework for heterogeneous multi-robot exploration using Behavioral Entropy (BE) and the distributed algorithm d-PBRAG to allocate exploration tasks (frontiers) among robots. It converges to Nash equilibrium, offering near-optimal task allocation with bounds for unknown utilities and reduced communication; simulations show benefits of heterogeneity and fast convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve efficiency and scalability of multi-robot exploration in heterogeneous teams under limited communication, by achieving near-optimal frontier assignment with provable convergence.

Method: Each robot performs SLAM, identifies areas of interest (AoIs/frontiers), and evaluates frontier utility using Behavioral Entropy. The task assignment is formulated as a non-cooperative game. A distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) is used to reach a Nash equilibrium, which corresponds to the optimal task allocation. For unknown utilities, robust bounds are derived via approximate rewards. Simulations explore the impact of sensing radii, sensing accuracy, and heterogeneity on exploration time and path length.

Result: The algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium, which matches the optimal task allocation. It offers reduced communication costs and fast convergence. Robust bounds are provided for cases with unknown utilities. Simulations show that heterogeneity among agents improves exploration performance (lower total time and shorter paths).

Conclusion: A distributed, game-theoretic approach using BE and d-PBRAG effectively allocates exploration tasks among heterogeneous robots, achieving near-optimal task allocation with low communication overhead and robustness to unknown utilities; heterogeneous teams can enhance exploration efficiency.

Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous
robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of
areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore
next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral
Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task
assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a
non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to
the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution).
For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards.
We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence)
in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy,
and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to
complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents
with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

*Yongkai Tian,Yirong Qi,Xin Yu,Wenjun Wu,Jie Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A symmetry-guided universal framework enhances sample efficiency in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning by incorporating symmetry into adversarial IRL, yielding better reward recovery and validated in both simulations and real multi-robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the heavy data requirements of MIRL due to costly expert demonstrations, particularly in multi-robot settings, by exploiting symmetry as an inductive bias.

Method: Introduce a universal framework that infuses symmetry into existing multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms, leveraging permutation/invariance properties to improve reward inference, with theoretical justification that symmetry aids reward recoverability and practical algorithms for learning.

Result: Empirical results across multiple challenging tasks show improved sample efficiency and reward recovery when symmetry is incorporated, with baselines lagging behind; successful validation in physical multi-robot systems demonstrates practicality.

Conclusion: Symmetry serves as a powerful inductive bias for MIRL; integrating symmetry into adversarial IRL frameworks significantly boosts sample efficiency and real-world viability in multi-robot applications.

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

*Sai Puneeth Reddy Gottam,Haoming Zhang,Eivydas Keras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Self-supervised, task-specific feedback improves feature extraction/tracking for visual localization, boosting robustness and generalization in challenging outdoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-based localization struggles in large-scale outdoor and long-term settings due to lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture regions, which degrade feature extraction and tracking. Although learning-based methods (e.g., SuperPoint, SuperGlue) help, they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data.

Method: Enhance deep feature extraction and tracking via self-supervised learning with task-specific feedback to produce stable and informative features that generalize better to challenging environments.

Result: Promotes stable and informative features, leading to improved generalization and reliability in challenging outdoor/localization scenarios.

Conclusion: Self-supervised, task-specific feature learning and tracking can significantly improve robustness of visual localization in real-world, changing environments and mitigate generalization gaps seen in existing methods.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion
estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show
improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues
with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature
extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific
feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving
generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

TL;DR: Glove-based tactile-kinematic perception and TK-STGN graph networks for human-to-robot grasp skill transfer, validated on deformable-object grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between tactile/kinesthetic feedback and motor actions in robotic grasping; enable natural human demonstrations to transfer to robotic hands; achieve cross-demonstrator and cross-hand compatibility including deformable object grasping.

Method: Use a data glove to collect joint-level tactile and kinesthetic data; unify inputs as graph representations with polar coordinates that account for morphology; introduce Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN) using multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM to predict joint-state trajectories, mapped to robot commands via a force-position hybrid mapping.

Result: Validation on generalized grasping tasks, including deformable objects, showing effective grasp skill transfer and control across demonstrations.

Conclusion: TK-STGN provides a unified, transferable tactile-kinematic perception framework for grasp skill transfer, leveraging graph-based spatio-temporal processing and morphology-aware representations to handle cross-demonstrator and object variability.

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PegasusFlow introduces a diffusion-based, data-efficient trajectory planning framework that bypasses expert data via Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO) and parallelized sampling; it achieves superior sample efficiency and faster convergence, with 100% success in a barrier-crossing task and ~18% faster performance than the next best method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-learning reliance and data scarcity hinder practical deployment of diffusion-based robot trajectory planners; expert demonstrations are costly or unavailable for specialized robots.

Method: A hierarchical rolling-denoising diffusion model called PegasusFlow with WBFO, using spline-based basis representations to parameterize trajectory score gradients; AVWBFO (Action-Value WBFO) with RL warm-start; asynchronous parallel simulation enabling massively parallel rollouts; direct learning from environmental interaction without expert data.

Result: Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation show superior performance; barrier-crossing task achieves 100% success and is 18% faster than the next-best method; results outperform baselines (e.g., MPPI), demonstrating improved sample efficiency and convergence.

Conclusion: PegasusFlow demonstrates effective data-efficient, scalable, and robust trajectory planning for complex terrains without reliance on expert data, with strong potential for deployment on data-scarce robotic platforms; future work could explore real-robot validation and broader tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory
planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical
bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This
paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome
this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that
enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function
Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve
superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional
methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous
parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for
efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and
robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly
Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,
significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task,
our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best
method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning.

*Kevin Saad,Vincenzo Petrone,Enrico Ferrentino,Pasquale Chiacchio,Francesco Braghin,Loris Roveda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A velocity-aware AI interaction controller (VAICAM) enhances force tracking of a Direct Force Controller by using an ensemble of neural networks to predict contact forces, incorporating tangential velocity, and solving an optimization to generate a residual action added to the impedance controller, validated in Gazebo on a Panda robot and outperforming two baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interaction controllers in manipulation require extensive tuning or knowledge of the environment, limiting practicality in real-world tasks. There is a need for robust, learning-based approaches that account for dynamic contact forces and robot motion (especially tangential velocity) to improve force tracking.

Method: An ensemble of feedforward neural networks predicts contact forces while accounting for the manipulator's tangential velocity. The predictions are used in an optimization problem to compute an optimal residual action, which is added to the Direct Force Controller output and fed into an impedance controller.

Result: The VAICAM controller demonstrates superior force-tracking performance across a wide set of trajectories in Gazebo simulations of a Franka Emika Panda, outperforming two baseline controllers.

Conclusion: Velocity-augmented AI-driven interaction control can significantly improve force tracking in manipulator tasks with contact, offering robust performance in simulation and potential real-world applicability.

Abstract: As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for
ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional
interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert
knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world
applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural
Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force
Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the
manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion,
especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward
NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an
optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to
the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed
Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous
Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda
robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance
compared to two baseline controllers.

TL;DR: Extended herding framework for defensive robots to steer adversaries away from protected zones using hierarchical reach-avoid game theory and local planning, with virtual containment boundaries and event-triggered pursuit; validated via simulations showing safe, collision-free navigation and effective guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed-formation shepherding struggles in urban/obstacle-rich environments and against unknown/adaptive adversaries; a scalable, robust approach is needed to safely guide adversaries to safe regions.

Method: A hierarchical hybrid framework combining reach-avoid game theory with local motion planning. Key components include a virtual containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to coordinate multiple agents.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to designated regions while preserving collision-free motion in dynamic environments, indicating scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, robust approach for defending zones against adversarial agents by effectively guiding them to safe regions, with potential applicability to real-world multi-robot defense scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of
autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both
unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional
shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky
in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents
with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an
extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide
adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into
predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in
dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on
reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual
containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable
and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to
designated regions.

### [84] [CLAP: Clustering to Localize Across n Possibilities, A Simple, Robust Geometric Approach in the Presence of Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08495)
*Gabriel I. Fernandez,Ruochen Hou,Alex Xu,Colin Togashi,Dennis W. Hong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLAP (Clustering to Localize Across n Possibilities) clusters robot state estimates derived from pairs of field features to localize global pose. It’s paired with a particle filter and an Extended Kalman Filter to improve consistency. It shows similar accuracy to landmark-based methods but superior robustness to false positives, demonstrated in RoboCup 2024 where lighting, occlusions, and noise were present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The robot operates with only stereo vision and an IMU under challenging, dynamic conditions (varying lighting, occlusions, high-impact stepping noise, bystander/field feature false detections). A robust localization method is needed as the foundation for planning and strategy.

Method: CLAP generates multiple state estimates from feature pairs, then clusters these estimates in state space to identify the true global pose (position and orientation). Correct estimates form tight clusters; incorrect ones spread out. This clustering is integrated with a particle filter and an EKF to improve consistency and smoothing. The approach is compared to landmark-based localization and shows particular robustness under high false-positive detections.

Result: CLAP achieves robustness with minimal divergence and velocity jumps, outperforming other methods under increased false positives while maintaining similar accuracy to landmark-based methods. In RoboCup 2024, the localization supported long-range shooting and tight defense.

Conclusion: The clustering-based localization (CLAP) provides a robust foundation for localization under noisy and uncertain sensing, especially with false positives. When fused with PF and EKF, it yields consistent, smooth estimates and competitive accuracy, suggesting strong potential for real-world, dynamic robotic applications like autonomous soccer and possibly other domains with similar sensing constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence
and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing
our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.

TL;DR: A design-through-co-design study engaging frailty-inclusive stakeholders to derive practical design requirements for assistive robotics aimed at older adults, highlighting psychosocial and environmental context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between lab prototypes and real-world usability; addressing frailty-related needs and the psychosocial factors that affect adoption.

Method: Series of seven co-design workshops with 61 participants (people with frailty, their carers, healthcare professionals) and a persona-based approach to capture emotional, social, and psychological dimensions.

Result: Identification of design requirements rooted in frailty-specific contexts; recognition of emotional, social, and environmental factors shaping use; actionable guidance to steer design toward real-world viability.

Conclusion: To move assistive robotics from lab to practical use, design must integrate psychosocial, environmental, and everyday-life considerations; the persona approach helps reveal nuanced needs and informs pragmatic design thinking.

Abstract: While assistive robots have much potential to help older people with
frailty-related needs, there are few in use. There is a gap between what is
developed in laboratories and what would be viable in real-world contexts.
Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions)
including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare
professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning
the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced
emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be
developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and
environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct
relation to frailty, can help promote design thinking that addresses people's
needs in a more pragmatic way to move assistive robotics closer to real-world
use.

*Soheil Espahbodini Nia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FMT^x extends FMT* for dynamic replanning with minimal updates, preserving asymptotic optimality and outperforming RRT^x in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments require real-time path adaptation; static single-pass planners can't revise paths efficiently; improving replanning efficiency is crucial.

Method: Modify FMT* neighbor selection to allow cost-to-come updates upon discovering better connections; maintain a cost-ordered queue; use an expanding neighbor to trigger re-evaluation of potentially suboptimal nodes; prove asymptotic optimality preserved; analyze computational efficiency.

Result: FMT^x achieves asymptotically optimal solutions after environmental changes; experimental results show faster and less computationally expensive replanning, outperforming RRT^x.

Conclusion: FMT^x offers robust, efficient dynamic replanning by retaining FMT* efficiency while enabling updates, suitable for real-time robotics in unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

Conclusion: RoboMatch provides a robust, scalable solution for complex mobile manipulation tasks in dynamic environments, enhancing control, perception, and planning components.

Abstract: This paper presents RoboMatch, a novel unified teleoperation platform for
mobile manipulation with an auto-matching network architecture, designed to
tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances
teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and
operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control
interface that enables synchronous operation of the mobile base and dual arms,
significantly improving control precision and data collection. Moreover, we
introduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which
leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature
extraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich
proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.
Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that
decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns
lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,
increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon
inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution
for complex manipulation tasks.

*Rebecca Martin,Jay Patrikar,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM-Agent framework coolname automates generation of semantically meaningful test cases to map failures of specialized black-box models onto a low-dimensional text-embedding manifold, enabling an uncertainty-aware failure distribution; demonstrated on MNIST variants and aerial-vision intrusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auditing operational design domains (ODD) of high-stakes ML systems is essential for safety and compliance, but high-dimensional inputs and domain expertise demands make manual testing costly; an automated, uncertainty-aware approach is needed.

Method: An LLM-Agent orchestrates test-case generation and responses from the model-under-test, while mapping inputs to a low-dimensional text-embedding latent space to fit an uncertainty-aware failure distribution. The agent iteratively probes the MUT with tool-assisted test-case generation, records outcomes, and uses uncertainty estimates to guide exploration of the failure landscape.

Result: The approach is demonstrated in a simplified MNIST-based setting with missing digits and in a real-world scenario of vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles, illustrating feasibility of automated ODD discovery and failure-mode mapping.

Conclusion: LLM-Agents can automate robust auditing of specialized black-box models by uncovering and characterizing failure landscapes in embedding space, reducing manual effort and improving safety/compliance in high-risk deployments.

Abstract: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,
are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high
risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their
operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.
However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires
significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we
introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of
semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized
black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit
a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding
manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension
text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building
the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe
the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides
the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional
manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained
with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of
vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

Conclusion: Offers a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments, enabling zero-shot, long-horizon navigation without 3D maps or specialized controllers, with improved generalization and deployment potential.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D

difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or

### [90] [Parallel, Asymptotically Optimal Algorithms for Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08743)
*Anoop Bhat,Geordan Gutow,Bhaskar Vundurthy,Zhongqiang Ren,Sivakumar Rathinam,Howie Choset*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Iterated Random Generalized TSP (IRG-TSP) framework for Moving-Target TSP with nonlinear targets or agent constraints; introduces two parallel solvers (IRG-PGLNS and PCG) that converge faster than prior baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT-TSP methods lack guarantees of convergence to an optimal solution when targets have nonlinear trajectories or the agent has kinematic constraints; a framework with convergence guarantees and practical speed is needed.

Method: Alternates between randomly sampling interception configuration-time points and solving a generalized TSP (GTSP) over these points. Two parallel implementations: IRG-PGLNS, which solves GTSPs using a parallelized GLNS extension (PGLNS), and PCG, which solves GTSPs for multiple point sets in parallel (Parallel Communicating GTSPs).

Result: Numerical results for three MT-TSP variants (distance-based interception, variable-speed Dubins car, redundant robot arm) show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG converge faster than a baseline based on prior work; both exhibit asymptotic convergence to the optimum.

Conclusion: The IRG framework enables asymptotic optimality for MT-TSP under realistic target dynamics and agent constraints, while providing scalable, parallel GTSP-based solvers that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: The Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks an agent
trajectory that intercepts several moving targets, within a particular time
window for each target. In the presence of generic nonlinear target
trajectories or kinematic constraints on the agent, no prior algorithm
guarantees convergence to an optimal MT-TSP solution. Therefore, we introduce
the Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework. The key idea behind IRG is
to alternate between randomly sampling a set of agent configuration-time
points, corresponding to interceptions of targets, and finding a sequence of
interception points by solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). This alternation
enables asymptotic convergence to the optimum. We introduce two parallel
algorithms within the IRG framework. The first algorithm, IRG-PGLNS, solves
GTSPs using PGLNS, our parallelized extension of the state-of-the-art solver
GLNS. The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs
corresponding to several sets of points simultaneously. We present numerical
results for three variants of the MT-TSP: one where intercepting a target only
requires coming within a particular distance, another where the agent is a
variable-speed Dubins car, and a third where the agent is a redundant robot
arm. We show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG both converge faster than a baseline based
on prior work.

*Michael J. Munje,Chen Tang,Shuijing Liu,Zichao Hu,Yifeng Zhu,Jiaxun Cui,Garrett Warnell,Joydeep Biswas,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces SocialNav-SUB, a VQA benchmark to evaluate visual-language models on social robot navigation, showing current SOTA VLMs lag behind rule-based baselines and human consensus in social scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in robust, socially compliant navigation by evaluating VLMs' ability to infer spatial-temporal relations and human intentions in social scenes.

Method: Create a VQA dataset tailored to social navigation with spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning; compare state-of-the-art VLMs to rule-based and human baselines; analyze agreement with human answers.

Result: Best VLM aligns with human answers but underperforms rule-based and human consensus baselines; reveals significant gaps in social scene understanding; dataset and framework enable targeted improvements.

Conclusion: SocialNav-SUB provides a platform for evaluating and shaping foundation models for social robot navigation, guiding future work to tailor VLMs to real-world social navigation needs.

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

### [92] [Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion for Planning with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08775)
*Wonsuhk Jung,Utkarsh A. Mishra,Nadun Ranawaka Arachchige,Yongxin Chen,Danfei Xu,Shreyas Kousik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JM2D (Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion) is a joint sampling framework that aligns diffusion planners with model-based safety controllers by maximizing an interaction potential via importance sampling, requiring no extra training and handling non-differentiable objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve compatibility issues when diffusion's multi-modal outputs conflict with optimization-based safety modules, enabling safe, constrained planning without retraining diffusion or differentiable surrogates.

Method: Formulate integration as a joint sampling problem over diffusion outputs and module outputs, guided by an interaction potential that captures compatibility. Use importance sampling to steer outputs based on interaction potential evaluations, allowing non-differentiable optimization modules and non-convex objectives. No additional training needed. Demonstrate that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and compare with gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

Result: Significant performance gains over conventional safety filters in offline RL and robot manipulation tasks, without compromising safety. JM2D outperforms baselines, and the framework is versatile enough to encompass conditional generation.

Conclusion: JM2D provides a general, training-free mechanism to harmonize model-free diffusion and model-based constraints through an interaction potential and importance sampling, with broad applicability including conditional generation and non-differentiable objectives.

Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

### [93] [Calib3R: A 3D Foundation Model for Multi-Camera to Robot Calibration and 3D Metric-Scaled Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08813)
*Davide Allegro,Matteo Terreran,Stefano Ghidoni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Calib3R jointly estimates camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D scenes from RGB data in a single optimization, for single- and multi-camera robots, with under-10-image accuracy and no patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration and 3D reconstruction depend on geometric correspondences but are usually treated separately; existing methods rely on patterns or yield unknown-scale reconstructions; need a patternless, unified approach compatible with multi-camera setups.

Method: Unified optimization that combines camera-to-robot calibration with metric-scaled 3D reconstruction using pointmaps from MASt3R; uses RGB images and robot poses; supports single and multi-camera configurations; aligns reconstructions to the robot reference frame.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse datasets shows Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with fewer than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based baselines.

Conclusion: Calib3R offers a patternless, unified framework for simultaneous calibration and metric 3D reconstruction, simplifying robot perception pipelines and enabling reliable interaction with minimal data.

Abstract: Robots often rely on RGB images for tasks like manipulation and navigation.
However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that
is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on
accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually
treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB
data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction
yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera
setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference
frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs
camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified
optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or
mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps
from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D
scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R
achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming
target-less and marker-based methods.

*Zongzheng Zhang,Chenghao Yue,Haobo Xu,Minwen Liao,Xianglin Qi,Huan-ang Gao,Ziwei Wang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A RoboChemist framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to plan, prompt, and monitor robotic chemistry tasks, improving success and regulatory compliance over prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic chemistry faces long-horizon procedures, hazardous substances, and strict normative compliance; prior systems struggle with depth perception, transparent labware, or semantic feedback.

Method: Use a VLM as planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, as a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and as a monitor for task success and regulatory compliance; introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM for precise, goal-conditioned control.

Result: Achieves 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 increase in compliance rate compared with state-of-the-art VLA baselines; demonstrates generalization to new objects and tasks; handles both primitive actions and full multi-step protocols.

Conclusion: Integrating VLM-driven planning, prompting, and monitoring with VLA controllers enhances robustness and regulatory compliance in robotic chemistry, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control and better generalization.

Abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks
and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable
substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict
compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose
\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based
systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with
transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack
semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve
as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt
generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and
regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned
control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete
multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate
and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA
baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.

### [95] [Learning-Based Planning for Improving Science Return of Earth Observation Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07997)
*Abigail Breitfeld,Alberto Candela,Juan Delfa,Akseli Kangaslahti,Itai Zilberstein,Steve Chien,David Wettergreen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning-based dynamic targeting for Earth-observing satellites using reinforcement and imitation learning outperforms heuristics in planning sampling locations; data-efficient and builds on a dynamic programming planner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize information gain from satellite sensors within strict orbital and resource constraints by allowing learning-based methods to reconfigure and point primary instruments using lookahead data.

Method: Two learning approaches are explored—reinforcement learning and imitation learning—each building on a dynamic programming solution that plans a sequence of sampling locations. The methods are evaluated against existing heuristic dynamic-targeting methods.

Result: Imitation learning yields ~10.0% better performance than the best heuristic method; reinforcement learning yields ~13.7% better performance on average. Both approaches can be trained effectively with relatively small data.

Conclusion: Learning-based dynamic targeting is effective for Earth observation missions, surpassing heuristic methods and being data-efficient, suggesting practical applicability for optimizing satellite data collection.

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

*Linyao Chen,Zimian Peng,Yingxuan Yang,Yikun Wang,Wenzheng Tom Tang,Hiroki H. Kobayashi,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX turns GitHub repositories into autonomous, agentic entities that initialize, understand, and operate repository functionality through a three-phase process (TODO-guided initialization, agentic automation, A2A collaboration), enabling automated reuse across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome manual, error-prone, and disconnected software reuse by transforming repositories from passive code resources into active agents that can understand, set up dependencies, and collaborate to accomplish tasks.

Method: Three-phase framework: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization to prepare dependencies, data, and validation sets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation where repository-specific agents autonomously perform real-world tasks; (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol enabling multiple agents to collaborate. Integrates large language models with structured tool use to automate understanding, initialization, and operationalization of repository functionality; evaluation on GitTaskBench with 18 repositories across domains; metrics include execution completion rate and task pass rate; case studies show multi-repo collaboration via A2A.

Result: EnvX achieved 74.07% execution completion and 51.85% task pass rate on GitTaskBench, outperforming existing frameworks; demonstrates the feasibility and benefit of agentic, collaborative repository interactions across domains.

Conclusion: Treating repositories as intelligent, interactive agents rather than passive code resources can enhance accessibility and collaboration in the open-source ecosystem, enabling more efficient and scalable software reuse.

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [97] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 2TSD uses a teacher-student LAM-based architecture to distill task-specific trust semantics from a server-side teacher to device-side students, enabling faster, more accurate collaborator selection with reduced resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating trustworthiness of potential collaborators is data/communication heavy when each task owner assesses all candidates, leading to overhead and stale trust assessments; a centralized, task-specific distillation approach can reduce overhead and improve accuracy.

Method: A server-hosted teacher agent with augmented memory collects multidimensional trust data, extracts task-specific trust semantics, and performs collaborator matching. It distills these semantics to lightweight student agents on devices, enabling rapid and accurate selection of collaborators for each task.

Result: Experiments show reduced collaborator evaluation time, lower device resource consumption, and improved accuracy of collaborator selection compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The 2TSD framework effectively enables efficient, scalable trust evaluation in distributed task collaboration by transferring distilled trust semantics from a powerful teacher to lightweight student agents.

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Wei-jin Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented planning framework (ExRAP) for continual instruction following in embodied agents, combining environment exploration, memory-augmented grounding, exploration-based planning, and temporal consistency refinements to improve performance in non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable LLM-based embodied agents to operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments with continual instructions, addressing memory decay and balancing exploration with grounding for robust planning.

Method: ExRAP uses an environmental context memory and decomposes each instruction into queries on this memory; employs memory-augmented query evaluation; introduces an exploration-integrated task planning scheme via information-based exploration; applies temporal consistency refinement to reduce memory decay effects.

Result: Empirical evaluation on VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA shows robustness across varying instruction scales/types and non-stationarity; ExRAP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in both goal success rate and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: ExRAP provides a robust, efficient LLM-based planning framework for embodied agents in non-stationary environments by grounding planning in a dynamically maintained environmental context memory and guided exploration, surpassing prior methods.

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

Result: The approach yielded promising results in music plagiarism detection experiments and showed potential for real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed MIR-based segmentation and multi-feature similarity framework, together with the SMP dataset, can support real-world music IP protection research and practice.

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR

musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive

plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are

Motivation: Bridge architectural theory and operational telecom practice to realize Level 4 autonomous networks. Align with TM Forum’s self-configuring/healing/optimizing vision by implementing Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functioning cognitive system with hybrid knowledge representations.

Method: Implement Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture as a functional cognitive system with coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation; conduct an empirical case study on a Radio Access Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent in 5G NR sub-6 GHz.

Conclusion: The proposed AN Agent architecture is viable for delivering Level 4 autonomy in telecommunications, addressing traditional autonomy barriers and advancing essential L4-enabling capabilities for next-generation networks.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access

transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)

overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic framework (Co-Investigator AI) to draft SARs more quickly and accurately via specialized agents (planning, crime-type detection, external intelligence, validation) with privacy guard and human-in-the-loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR generation is costly and non-scalable; LLMs risk hallucinations, misalignment, and poor explainability in compliance contexts; need reliable, transparent, scalable tool for AML.

Method: Multi-agent architecture: planning agent, crime-type detector, external intelligence collector, compliance validation agent, dynamic memory, AI-Privacy Guard, Agent-as-a-Judge for QA; human-in-the-loop workflow; evaluation across financial crime scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates improved speed and accuracy, better regulatory alignment, and clearer narratives; reduces workload for compliance teams while preserving oversight.

Conclusion: Presents a pathway to scalable, reliable, transparent SAR generation; integrates AI agents into core regulatory processes and enables more efficient compliance workflows.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCPO introduces stepwise preference optimization and an Action Policy Consistency Constraint to improve embodied decision-making in vision-language model (VLM) agents. It converts sparse rewards into richer step samples and aligns intermediate reasoning to reduce degradation, achieving a 6% boost over RL4VLM in ALFWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is aligning powerful VLMs with real-time, dynamic embodied tasks, where sluggish responses and hallucinations persist. Post-SFT methods relying on RL and CoT suffer from sparse rewards, limited action optimization, low sample efficiency, and model degradation after fine-tuning.

Method: Propose Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) featuring stepwise preference-based optimization to derive richer training signals from intermediate reasoning, and introduce Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC) to enforce consistency on model outputs. Evaluate in the ALFWorld embodied task.

Result: In ALFWorld, TCPO achieved an average success rate of 26.67%, about 6% higher than RL4VLM, indicating improved decision-making and mitigation of degradation after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Integrating preference-based learning with chain-of-thought processes enhances embodied agent decision-making and model stability; TCPO with APC shows promise for aligning VLMs with dynamic real-world tasks.

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

### [103] [No-Knowledge Alarms for Misaligned LLMs-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08593)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: No-ground-truth evaluation of LLM judges using logical consistency among judges, formalized as a linear-programming framework to detect misaligned judges without false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When evaluating LLMs, relying on expert judgments creates an infinite chain of evaluation if the judges themselves cannot be trusted. The work aims to groundedly identify misalignment without ground truth by exploiting consistency constraints among judges.

Method: Model disagreements among a finite set of judges as integer response counts, formulate a linear-programming problem to infer feasible grading behavior, and derive no-knowledge alarms that flag violations.

Result: A linear-programming-based alarm system that, under the stated model, can identify (with no false positives) that at least one member of a judge ensemble violates the user-defined grading ability requirement.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, ground-truth-free audit mechanism for LLM evaluation pipelines, enabling robust detection of misaligned judging components.

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

### [104] [Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08682)
*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Jiawei Shen,Jingjiang Liu,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a multi-granularity causal inference framework for failure attribution in multi-agent systems (MAS), combining performance causal inversion and Shapley-based blame with a causal discovery method (CDC-MAS); achieves improved step-level accuracy and task success on Who&When and TRAIL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failure attribution in MAS is critical for reliable deployment but current methods rely on statistical correlations and perform poorly on challenging benchmarks, hindering debugging and optimization.

Method: 1) Performance causal inversion principle that reverses data flow in execution logs to model performance dependencies; 2) use of Shapley values to assign agent-level blame; 3) CDC-MAS, a causal discovery algorithm robust to non-stationary MAS interaction data; 4) automated optimization loop using counterfactual simulations to generate targeted improvements.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Who&When and TRAIL benchmarks shows substantial gains: up to 36.2% step-level accuracy in locating root-cause steps; averaged 22.4% improvement in overall task success rates due to generated optimizations.

Conclusion: A principled, effective framework for debugging complex agent interactions in MAS, enabling more reliable and interpretable systems and facilitating automated optimization based on causal attribution.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dual-system ToM model: fast graph-based System 1 via GCNs plus slow meta-learning System 2 with a context gate; validated on false-belief tasks; reproduces cognitive biases (anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing, priming); shows human-like adaptive behavior and robust generalization; advances AI social cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge artificial intelligence with cognitive theory by modeling dual-process reasoning to achieve nuanced, adaptive social cognition in AI; enable generalization to unseen contexts and exploration of biases.

Method: System 1: fast, habitual reasoning implemented with graph convolutional networks; System 2: slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning via meta-learning; a learned context gate balances the two; evaluated on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically tested for biases (anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing effects, priming effects).

Result: The dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, demonstrates robust generalization to unseen contexts, and provides insights into cognitive mechanisms underlying reasoning biases; supports the potential of combined fast and slow reasoning for human-like social cognition in AI.

Conclusion: Bridges AI with cognitive theory, enabling AI systems with nuanced, human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making; offers a framework to study biases and adaptivity in AI agents.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

### [106] [The More You Automate, the Less You See: Hidden Pitfalls of AI Scientist Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08713)
*Ziming Luo,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Nihar B. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Identifies four potential failure modes in AI scientist systems (inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, post-hoc selection bias); uses controlled experiments on two open-source systems to reveal failures; emphasizes the value of access to trace logs and code for better detection; recommends mandatory submission of artifacts for transparency and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI scientist systems automate end-to-end research workflows, ensuring integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness requires scrutinizing their internal workflows and evaluation artifacts, not just final papers.

Method: Designs controlled experiments to isolate each failure mode, evaluates two prominent open-source AI scientist systems, and analyzes trace logs and the full automated workflow to detect issues beyond the final paper.

Result: The study uncovers failures across a spectrum of severity that can be easily overlooked; relying solely on final results raises risks, whereas access to internal artifacts enables more effective failure detection.

Conclusion: Journals and conferences should require submission of internal artifacts (trace logs and code) with AI-generated research to enhance transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

*Anup Tuladhar,Araz Minhas,Adam Kirton,Eli Kinney-Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A preliminary platform integrating RL and language-model narrative reasoning to study how narrative frames influence reward-based decision-making in a configurable gridworld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge RL decision-making with narrative/symbolic reasoning; to examine if narrative frameworks can shape learning dynamics and policy decisions.

Method: Dual-system: RL policy suggests actions; LM applies narrative frameworks to process suggestions and guide decisions; configurable gridworld; modular environment; logging of policy values, LM reasoning traces, and action patterns.

Result: Preliminary implementation establishing a testbed; no definitive empirical results yet; enables controlled experimentation on narrative effects and interaction with optimization-based learning.

Conclusion: The platform provides a structured foundation for investigating interactions between RL and narrative reasoning; potential to uncover how narrative framing modulates reward-based learning; requires further validation, metrics, and robust evaluation.

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

### [109] [How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058)
*Kai Ye,Liangcai Su,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) and Unlearnable Distance (UD) to quantify data unlearnability through loss landscape analysis; finds current unlearnable methods fail to guarantee cross-task unlearnability on Taskonomy and benchmarks methods to reveal their limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data ownership and privacy in the era of large models; existing unlearnable methods aim to degrade training on unauthorized data but lack cross-task guarantees; need a framework to relate unlearnability to optimization and loss landscape.

Method: Compare convergence of clean vs poisoned models; analyze loss landscape to identify optimization paths; define SAL to measure parameter unlearnability and UD to measure data unlearnability; benchmark mainstream unlearnable methods on Taskonomy.

Result: Only a subset of critical optimization paths diverge between clean and poisoned models; SAL distribution correlates with unlearnability; UD quantifies data unlearnability; current UE methods show limited cross-task effectiveness on Taskonomy; benchmarks reveal boundaries.

Conclusion: A loss-landscape perspective links unlearnability to optimization; SAL and UD provide quantifiable metrics; results urge rethinking of unlearnable methods and highlight their limitations across tasks.

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity Linking (EL) is essential for connecting mentions in text to entities in Knowledge Graphs, enabling scalable integration of heterogeneous data. There is substantial enterprise demand and cost for EL-driven analytics, motivating the need for a computationally efficient solution.

Method: Proposes JEL, an end-to-end multi-neural network based EL model optimized for computational efficiency, aimed at beating state-of-the-art EL methods.

Result: The model claims to beat the current state-of-the-art EL models.

Conclusion: JEL promises more scalable, efficient EL suitable for enterprise applications such as News Analytics, enabling better bridging between unstructured text and knowledge graphs.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenAI in healthcare evaluation needs generalizable methods beyond benchmarks; human-expert and cost-effective evaluators complement traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable, generalizable assessment of GenAI across clinical tasks and data distributions, and to avoid training/testing overfitting and poor cross-distribution performance.

Method: Survey of current evaluation methodologies for GenAI in healthcare and medical devices; analysis of benchmark limitations; discussion of human-in-the-loop and low-cost computational evaluators as alternatives.

Result: Benchmarks alone may not generalize; evidence supports integrating expert human evaluation and inexpensive computational evaluators to improve generalizability; the paper synthesizes current best practices and outlines directions for evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: Advancing GenAI evaluation in healthcare requires a diversified approach that combines human expertise with affordable computational evaluators to better capture real-world variability and task suitability.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

*Lucas Fenaux,Zheng Wang,Jacob Yan,Nathan Chung,Florian Kerschbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new adaptive backdoor attack in federated learning is proposed, and a two-part defense (Hammer and Anvil) is designed; their best combo (Krum+) defends against both the new attacker and existing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks by malicious clients; adaptive attackers adapt to defenses, and current defenses often fail, compromising model integrity.

Method: Introduce a stronger adaptive adversary; develop Hammer and Anvil by combining two orthogonal defenses; integrate them into a unified defense; identify Krum+ as the strongest combined defense against the attacks.

Result: Krum+ successfully defends against the newly proposed adaptive attacker and state-of-the-art attacks under appropriate parameter settings.

Conclusion: A principled strategy of combining orthogonal defenses can yield robust protection in federated learning; Krum+ offers strong resilience to adaptive backdoors, though performance may depend on parameter choices and deployment context.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

TL;DR: PhysioCLR is a physiology-informed self-supervised learning framework for ECG that uses domain-specific similarity cues and ECG-specific augmentations to learn transferable, clinically relevant representations for arrhythmia classification under limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG AI is hampered by scarce labeled data and the need for generalizable, clinically meaningful representations that transfer across datasets; leveraging physiology knowledge can enhance SSL effectiveness for ECG analysis.

Method: PhysioCLR pretrains with contrastive learning by pulling together embeddings of physiologically similar ECG samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, incorporating ECG-specific augmentations that preserve category, and using a hybrid loss to refine representation quality.

Result: On Chapman and Georgia public datasets for multilabel ECG diagnoses and a private ICU dataset for binary classification, PhysioCLR improved mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating physiological knowledge into contrastive SSL yields clinically meaningful, transferable ECG features and supports label-efficient ECG diagnostics across datasets.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

TL;DR: A thesis identifying five core federated learning challenges and proposing novel solutions, bridging theory and practice to guide real-world implementations and the reverse translation into theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is decentralized and faces heterogeneity in data and devices, unreliable communication, and privacy concerns. Despite strong theoretical advances, practical gaps remain in implementing FL in real-world, less controlled settings.

Method: Identify five key challenges in FL, propose novel algorithmic and system-level approaches to address them, and analyze how practical implementation insights can inform theory as well as guide practitioners in translating methods to real-world software.

Result: Development of novel FL algorithms and system designs that bridge theory and practice, along with pragmatic guidance for researchers on translating theoretical methods into real-world implementations and understanding how practical constraints can inform theoretical improvements.

Conclusion: The work advances FL algorithms and systems, offering a practical guide for researchers and highlighting bidirectional knowledge transfer between practice and theory to reveal new dimensions for algorithm design.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Credibility Transformer augmented with in-context learning uses a context batch of similar instances to refine CLS representations, boosting predictive accuracy and generalization to unseen feature levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of standard Transformers by integrating credibility-based representations and leveraging in-context information to better adapt to changing risk patterns and unseen categorical covariates.

Method: Extend the Credibility Transformer with an in-context learning mechanism: construct a context batch of similar instances, enhance CLS token representations with contextual information, and allow fine-tuning to improve predictions.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that in-context learning improves predictive accuracy by adapting to similar risk patterns and enables generalization to new feature levels (e.g., newly introduced vehicle models).

Conclusion: Combining credibility-based representations with in-context learning yields stronger adaptation to evolving data and unseen covariate values, enhancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

supervised learning, particularly useful when fine-grained annotations are
unavailable. Despite growing interest in deep MIL methods, the field lacks
standardized tools for model development, evaluation, and comparison, which
hinders reproducibility and accessibility. To address this, we present
torchmil, an open-source Python library built on PyTorch. torchmil offers a
unified, modular, and extensible framework, featuring basic building blocks for
MIL models, a standardized data format, and a curated collection of benchmark
datasets and models. The library includes comprehensive documentation and
tutorials to support both practitioners and researchers. torchmil aims to
accelerate progress in MIL and lower the entry barrier for new users. Available

### [117] [From Limited Data to Rare-event Prediction: LLM-powered Feature Engineering and Multi-model Learning in Venture Capital](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08140)
*Mihir Kumar,Aaron Ontoyin Yin,Zakari Salifu,Kelvin Amoaba,Afriyie Kwesi Samuel,Fuat Alican,Yigit Ihlamur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that uses LLM-powered feature engineering in a layered ensemble (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict rare, high-impact startup outcomes; achieves large precision gains over random baselines across three VC test sets, with interpretable drivers identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting rare, high-stakes outcomes in venture capital requires leveraging unstructured signals while maintaining interpretability for decision-makers; existing black-box models trade off predictive power for transparency.

Method: LLM-powered feature extraction from unstructured data; layered ensemble producing a continuous risk score, thresholded to yield a binary rare-event prediction; uses models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression; evaluation on VC data with three independent test subsets; feature sensitivity analysis to identify interpretable drivers.

Result: Precision 9.8x–11.1x higher than random classifier baseline across three independent test subsets; interpretable drivers identified: startup category list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by number of founders; education level and domain expertise contribute smaller but consistent effects.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of combining LLM-based feature engineering with multi-model ensembles to predict rare events while preserving interpretability; applicable to other domains with noisy early-stage data; suggests further work on calibration, comparison with stronger baselines, and broader validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

*Swati Swati,Arjun Roy,Emmanouil Panagiotou,Eirini Ntoutsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mmm-fair is an open-source boosting-based toolkit that enables multi-objective, fairness-aware classification with focus on intersectional biases, offering a no-code chat interface, LLM explanations, Pareto exploration, custom fairness constraints, and deployment-ready models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing regulatory and societal demand for equitable AI, together with limitations of current toolkits in handling multi-dimensional fairness and trade-offs, necessitates a system that can optimize across multiple fairness definitions and identify intersectional biases.

Method: Uses boosting-based ensemble methods to dynamically adjust model weights to minimize both classification errors and diverse fairness violations. It supports multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code chat-based interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto front exploration for model selection, and custom fairness constraint definitions, culminating in deployment-ready models.

Result: Provides a unified toolkit that enables deep multi-attribute fairness analysis and flexible trade-off exploration, reliably uncovering intersectional biases that may be missed by state-of-the-art methods, and offering an interactive Pareto-based workflow for model selection.

Conclusion: MMM-fair offers a rare, comprehensive combination of multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, explainability, and deployment readiness in a single open-source toolkit, filling a gap left by existing fairness tools.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

### [119] [Machine Learning with Multitype Protected Attributes: Intersectional Fairness through Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08163)
*Ho Ming Lee,Katrien Antonio,Benjamin Avanzi,Lorenzo Marchi,Rui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distance covariance regularization framework is proposed to enforce demographic parity in regression and classification with multiple protected attributes, addressing nonlinear dependencies and fairness gerrymandering through joint (JdCov) and concatenated (CCdCov) distance covariances, with a Jensen–Shannon divergence-based calibration, demonstrated on COMPAS and motor insurance data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fair predictions across multiple and continuous protected attributes and to prevent unfair disparities in intersectional subgroups (fairness gerrymandering), extending beyond binary classification and single-attribute setups.

Method: Introduce a regularization term based on distance covariance between predictions and protected attributes to penalize dependence. For multiple attributes, use joint distance covariance (JdCov) and the novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov) to capture multivariate dependencies and intersectional disparities. Provide a calibration approach for the regularization strength using Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify distributional differences across groups.

Result: Demonstrates reduction of dependence between model predictions and protected attributes and addresses fairness gerrymandering across intersectional subgroups, applicable to both regression and classification tasks. Validated on the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset, showing practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed distance covariance regularization framework offers a principled and scalable approach to fair prediction under multiple protected attributes, capturing nonlinear dependencies and intersectional disparities, with a practical calibration method and demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

### [120] [MARLINE: Multi-Source Mapping Transfer Learning for Non-Stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08176)
*Honghui Du,Leandro Minku,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARLINE is a multi-source transfer-learning method for non-stationary data streams that handles concept drift even when source and target concepts do not align by projecting the target into each source concept space and ensembling source sub-classifiers, achieving higher accuracy than several baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift harms online learning performance. Using multiple data sources could help, but existing approaches often assume at least one source matches the target concept; this assumption fails in many real-world scenarios.

Method: MARLINE projects the target concept into the space of each source concept and trains multiple source sub-classifiers; these are combined in an ensemble to predict the target concept in non-stationary environments, leveraging transfer learning across sources even when concepts do not match.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show MARLINE achieves greater accuracy than several state-of-the-art data stream learning approaches.

Conclusion: MARLINE demonstrates that multi-source transfer learning can benefit data stream learning in non-stationary environments even when source-target concepts do not align, providing a robust approach to concept drift.

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Motivation: Improve neural arithmetic generalization by allowing a neural unit to flexibly represent and combine arithmetic operations through a learnable gate that blends log- and linear-space representations.

Method: Introduce DMU with a single parameter gate that blends log-space and linear-space representations during arithmetic; provide two initialization schemes to cover different operation pairs (addition+multiplication, subtraction+division); evaluate on the NALM Benchmark.

Result: DMU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NALM Benchmark, attaining the highest percentage of seeds solved for multiplication and division across seeds; code will be released via a pull request to the NALM benchmark and is available on GitHub at the project's repositories.

Conclusion: DMU demonstrates enhanced neural arithmetic generalization by integrating a learnable representation-mixing gate, with practical open-source availability and integration potential for neural arithmetic benchmarks.

Abstract: The Domain Mixed Unit (DMU) is a new neural arithmetic unit that learns a
single parameter gate that mixes between log-space and linear-space
representations while performing either addition (DMU add) or subtraction (DMU
sub). Two initializations are proposed for the DMU: one covering addition and
multiplication, and another covering subtraction and division. The DMU achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NALM Benchmark, a dataset designed to test
the ability of neural arithmetic units to generalize arithmetic operations,
specifically performing with the highest percentage solved over all seeds on
multiplication and division. The DMU will be submitted as a pull request to the

### [122] [Multi-Label Transfer Learning in Non-Stationary Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08181)
*Honghui Du,Leandro Minku,Aonghus Lawlor,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces two transfer learning methods (BR-MARLENE and BRPW-MARLENE) for multi-label data streams with drift; show inter-label knowledge transfer improves accuracy over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In non-stationary, multi-label streams labels drift and may be interrelated; limited research exists on multi-label transfer learning for streams; leveraging cross-label knowledge and pairwise dependencies could accelerate adaptation.

Method: BR-MARLENE transfers knowledge across labels in both source and target streams for multi-label classification. BRPW-MARLENE extends this by explicitly modeling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to boost performance.

Result: Empirical experiments show both methods outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches under non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: Inter-label knowledge transfer is effective for improving predictive performance in non-stationary multi-label data streams; explicit modeling of pairwise dependencies provides additional gains.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

### [123] [Selective Induction Heads: How Transformers Select Causal Structures In Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08184)
*Francesco D'Angelo,Francesco Croce,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes selective induction heads that let transformers pick the right causal structure in-context by interleaving Markov chains with different lags; it provides a 3-layer transformer construction and proves convergence to MLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Induction heads copy tokens and enable in-context learning, but prior work assumes a fixed causal structure. Real language shows dynamic dependencies. The work aims to model and interpret how transformers select among varying causal structures and improve interpretability.

Method: Varies causal structure via interleaved Markov chains with different lags while keeping transition probabilities fixed. Constructs a 3-layer transformer to implement a selective induction head and provides theoretical analysis showing asymptotic convergence to maximum likelihood. Empirically demonstrates that transformers identify the correct lag and copy from the past.

Result: Introduces the Selective Induction Head as a new circuit enabling dynamic selection of the correct lag/cause in-context. Demonstrates that transformers can learn to predict the next token by identifying the appropriate lag and copying the corresponding past token. Provides a concrete 3-layer transformer construction and theoretical proof of convergence to MLE.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of how transformers select dynamic causal structures, aiding interpretability and shedding light on in-context learning mechanisms through selective induction heads.

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

### [124] [ArtifactGen: Benchmarking WGAN-GP vs Diffusion for Label-Aware EEG Artifact Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08188)
*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluates conditional GAN vs diffusion models to synthesize EEG artifacts for augmentation; WGAN-GP aligns spectrally and has lower MMD, but both models show weak class-conditional recovery, limiting augmentation gains; pipeline released for baseline and future analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG artifact labeling is costly and artifacts confound automated analysis. Generative artifact synthesis could provide realistic, label-aware data to augment datasets and stress-test detectors.

Method: Use TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus with subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows. Preprocess per model (min-max for adversarial, z-score per recording/channel for diffusion). Compare conditional WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance. Evaluate fidelity (Welch band-power deltas, channel-Frobenius distance, autocorrelation L2, MMD/PRD), specificity (class-conditional recovery via lightweight kNN/classifiers), and utility (augmentation effects on artifact recognition).

Result: WGAN-GP achieves closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data; both models exhibit weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains; suggests need for stronger conditioning and broader coverage.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible pipeline and baseline for EEG artifact synthesis, and highlights actionable failure modes for future work to improve conditioning and data coverage.

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a flexible, high-order yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and a Rollout loss to train reduced-order models (ROMs) for accurate long-time predictions of PDEs; validated on the 2D Burgers equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROMs offer fast PDE approximations but typically lose accuracy over long time horizons. There is a need for high-order, efficient numerical schemes and training objectives that preserve predictive power across arbitrary time horizons.

Method: Proposes a high-order, inexpensive finite-difference scheme and a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. Demonstrated on the 2D Burgers equation.

Result: Demonstrates the approach on the 2D Burgers equation, illustrating improved long-horizon predictive capability and efficiency relative to baseline ROMs.

Conclusion: The combined strategy enables reliable, efficient ROM-based forecasting for parameterized PDEs, with potential applicability to other complex PDE systems.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

*Caio de Prospero Iglesias,Kimberly Villalobos Carballo,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prescribe-then-Select (PS) builds a policy library and learns a meta-policy (ensemble of Optimal Policy Trees) to select the best policy per covariate, improving performance in heterogeneous contexts and matching the dominant policy when heterogeneity is absent; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In contextual stochastic optimization with hard feasibility constraints, multiple candidate policies perform variably across covariate space; no single policy dominates. A data-driven, context-aware policy selector is needed to consistently improve performance.

Method: Construct a library of feasible candidate policies; train a meta-policy to select the best policy given covariates. The meta-policy uses ensembles of Optimal Policy Trees trained via cross-validation on the training data, making policy choice entirely data-driven and ensuring feasibility.

Result: PS outperforms the best single policy across two benchmark problems (single-stage newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning) in heterogeneous covariate regimes and converges to the dominant policy when heterogeneity is absent; code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: The prescribe-then-select framework effectively handles covariate-driven heterogeneity in CSO, offering a modular, data-driven approach to policy selection that can outperform any single policy and adapt to situations with or without heterogeneity.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

### [127] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM) that combines gradient sketching with Gaussian DP for private federated learning; shows privacy scales as 1/sqrt(b) with sketch dimension b; achieves stronger privacy under the same noise budget and competitive performance especially with adaptive server optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce communication cost in FL via gradient sketching while ensuring client-level differential privacy via Gaussian mechanism; existing analyses treated sketching and GM separately, missing joint privacy effects.

Method: Propose SGM that jointly applies sketching to client updates and Gaussian noise, analyzed with Rényi-DP to obtain a unified privacy guarantee. Derive that privacy level scales as 1/sqrt(b) for fixed noise magnitude. Apply to FL with gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers; prove convergence with logarithmic dependence on parameter count d.

Result: SGM provides significantly sharper privacy guarantees than standard GM under the same noise budget for moderate sketch dimension b. In FL experiments, SGM-based training is at least competitive with non-sketching private FL and can outperform it in some settings; adaptive server optimization improves empirical performance while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: Jointly combining sketching with Gaussian DP yields a flexible, sharper privacy guarantee for private FL. Sketching does not just reduce communication but can also enhance privacy effectiveness; adaptive optimization can further boost performance without sacrificing privacy.

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR models face data efficiency constraints, unreliable predictions, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in real-world settings; there is a need for scalable uncertainty estimation and robust performance using unlabeled data.

Method: Introduces a self-supervised EDD framework for HAR, including a novel HAR-specific data augmentation technique, and trains with partially labeled/unlabeled data to produce calibrated predictive distributions and enhanced robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple public HAR datasets shows improved predictive accuracy, robust uncertainty estimates, and stronger adversarial robustness, while keeping inference complexity unchanged.

Conclusion: Self-supervised EDD with HAR-oriented augmentation effectively enhances reliability and robustness of HAR in real-world scenarios without added inference cost.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead is a key bottleneck in distributed and federated learning, especially under non-IID data and privacy requirements; there is a need for a unified compression theory, personalization to mitigate client drift, and pruning methods to minimize data exchange.

Method: Develops a unified framework for biased and unbiased compression with convergence guarantees; introduces adaptive local training with personalization (Scafflix) to balance global and personalized objectives; privacy-preserving pruning via hierarchical aggregation (Cohort-Squeeze); symmetric post-training pruning (SymWanda) that maintains accuracy without retraining.

Conclusion: Offers theoretical and practical guidance for scalable, efficient distributed learning by integrating compression, personalization, and pruning to reduce communication while preserving performance.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

Motivation: Addresses limitations of current datasets (scale, diversity, longitudinal coverage) to enable generalizable predictions and health equity research in critical care.

Method: CRISP transforms raw OMOP CDM data into ML-ready datasets via data quality audit trails, cross-vocabulary mapping to SNOMED-CT with deduplication and unit standardization, modular parallel pipeline (<1 day on standard hardware), and baseline model benchmarks across tasks; provides pipeline, implementations, and docs.

Result: Efficient, reproducible preprocessing and ready-to-use datasets; baseline models for reproducible performance; democratizes access and saves months of preprocessing, enabling broader research.

Conclusion: CRITICAL and CRISP together unlock scalable, interoperable critical care AI research, mitigating heterogeneity challenges and promoting generalizable, equity-focused clinical insights.

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

### [131] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Forgetting-aware Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08255)
*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAPM is a pruning-based method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of LLMs by using a CF metric based on the ratio of the task vector to pretrained parameters, integrated into pruning without changing training or data; it achieves very low forgetting (0.25%) while preserving 99.67% of downstream accuracy across eight datasets and provides reproducing code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning degrades performance on downstream tasks. Existing pruning approaches often disconnect training updates from retaining pretrained knowledge. The authors aim to balance forgetting and task performance with a simple, training-free pruning criterion that leverages the relationship between fine-tuning task vectors and pretrained parameters.

Method: Introduce Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM) that uses the ratio of the task vector (difference between fine-tuned weights and pretrained weights) to the pretrained parameters as a CF metric. This metric is integrated into the pruning criterion. The approach requires no training procedure modifications, no model architecture changes, and no auxiliary data. Experiments across eight datasets (NLI, General Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, cloze tests) demonstrate effectiveness.

Result: CF is limited to about 0.25% under FAPM, while downstream task accuracy remains at 99.67%. The method consistently balances forgetting and performance across diverse tasks. Code is provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: FAPM offers a simple, training-free pruning criterion that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuned LLMs without extra data or architectural changes, achieving near-complete retention of pre-trained knowledge while maintaining high downstream performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an accessible framework to evaluate VLMs on 2D physics using 400+ problems across four domains; finds model scale correlates with reasoning; top model achieves 0.815; performance varies, with formulaic tasks easier than abstract spatial reasoning; aims to democratize scientific reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess whether vision-language models can internalize fundamental physics, addressing a gap where existing benchmarks emphasize surface-level tasks.

Method: Develops a pragmatic scenario generator to produce a diverse testbed (400+ items) across Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics; evaluates four state-of-the-art VLMs; reports an overall score and domain-level performance, highlighting correlation with model size.

Result: Stronger performance with larger models; top performer Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieves 0.815 overall; models excel on formulaic problems but struggle with abstract spatial reasoning, indicating limitations in conceptual physics understanding.

Conclusion: The framework democratizes study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and provides insights into capabilities and limitations, guiding future work to enhance abstract reasoning in physics domains.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

TL;DR: MPWE: a regime-switching, matrix-profile-based weighted ensemble for rainfall forecasts in Vietnam; improves accuracy and stability across basins and horizons by capturing covariant dependencies and reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vietnam's rainfall is highly variable across basins and geographically diverse, making accurate forecasts critical for flood management, hydropower operation, and disaster preparedness.

Method: Matrix Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE); a regime-switching framework that dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model forecasts and applies redundancy-aware weighting to balance contributions across models, evaluated on eight basins and five forecast horizons (1h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 84h).

Result: MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of prediction errors than geographic models and ensemble baselines, indicating improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Conclusion: MPWE offers a robust, scalable approach for multi-model rainfall forecasting in complex, regionally varying climates, demonstrating enhanced performance and reliability for practical flood management and hydropower planning in Vietnam.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

*Yao Lu,Chunfeng Sun,Dongwei Xu,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoQuS selects a small coreset from the full dataset by tracking per-sample prediction trajectories during full training and computing three training-dynamics-based importance metrics; this enables near-full-model performance with only 1–30% of data for AMR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce training time and energy in deep-learning-based AMR by using a representative subset without sacrificing accuracy or generalization, facilitating rapid experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Record per-sample prediction trajectories during full training; compute three importance metrics based on training dynamics; construct a coreset by selecting samples with high importance; train AMR model on the coreset instead of the full dataset; evaluate cross-architecture generalization across datasets.

Result: Maintains high recognition accuracy and cross-architecture generalization on multiple AMR datasets using 1-30% of data.

Conclusion: Coreset-based data selection via FoQuS can significantly reduce training overhead in AMR while preserving performance and generalization.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

### [135] [EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08315)
*Bohan Yu,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvolKV is an adaptive layer-wise KV cache compression framework that uses evolutionary search to jointly optimize memory budgets and downstream task performance, outperforming baselines and achieving high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression relies on heuristics (e.g., uniform layer budgets, static eviction) that ignore interactions between layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, hurting generalization.

Method: Formulates cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization and employs evolutionary search to configure per-layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance.

Result: Outperforms all baselines across KV budgets on 11 tasks, with up to 7 percentage points improvement on GSM8K; achieves superior performance versus full KV cache using only 1.5% of the budget on code completion.

Conclusion: Learned, adaptive layer-wise KV cache budgets via evolutionary optimization can exceed heuristic methods and enable substantial memory savings with maintained or improved task performance.

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

### [136] [Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Convergence using Pre-trained Large Language Models as Tutors With Advice Reusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08329)
*Lukas Toral,Teddy Lazebnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM tutoring in RL speeds up convergence across multiple algorithms and environments; advisor reuse can further speed training but may impact stability; effectiveness depends on task, RL algorithm, and LLM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL training can be extremely slow, especially with sparse rewards. Existing techniques like reward shaping and curricula are often domain-specific and require substantial expertise. Using pre-trained LLMs as tutors offers a scalable, general-guidance approach to accelerate learning.

Method: Student–teacher setup where RL agents (DQN, PPO, A2C) are guided by LLM tutors (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek) across environments Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four. Evaluated 54 configurations. Measured convergence speed and final performance, and examined an advice reuse mechanism.

Result: LLM tutoring significantly accelerates convergence while achieving comparable final performance to baselines. Advice reuse can further reduce training time but may lead to less stable convergence dynamics.

Conclusion: LLM tutoring generally benefits RL convergence, but effectiveness depends on the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model; stability and model-task compatibility warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

### [137] [Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08342)
*Jiaming Yan,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEpic introduces adaptive expert-splitting for MoE inference to reduce VRAM usage and latency by caching top halves of hot experts and adaptively configuring cache per layer via a fixed-point algorithm; yields about 50% GPU memory savings and 38-66% latency reduction on MoE LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRAM bottleneck in MoE LLMs remains a barrier to widespread adoption. Offloading all experts to CPU RAM helps memory but suffers from poor cache hit rates and high loading latency. A smarter caching strategy and adaptive cache configuration are needed to improve inference speed under limited VRAM.

Method: Split each expert into two vertical segments (top and bottom). Cache the top segments of hot experts. Predict and prefetch the activated experts for the next layer; exempt top segments from fetching to reduce loading time and enable transfer-computation overlap. Propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration to adapt the per-layer cache budgets and expert-split ratios.

Result: Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs show MoEpic can save about half of the GPU memory cost and reduce inference latency by roughly 38% to 66% compared with baselines.

Conclusion: MoEpic effectively reduces VRAM usage and speeds up MoE inference by combining top-segment expert caching with adaptive per-layer cache configuration, addressing cache-hit and latency challenges for MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple gradient-perturbation technique that blends prediction and decision loss gradients to stabilize decision-focused learning (DFL) and improve decision quality, with convergence guarantees and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL often suffers from unstable optimization due to flat/sharp loss landscapes; PFL is stable but ignores downstream decisions; a method is needed that improves decision quality without adding training complexity.

Method: Perturb the decision-loss gradient using the prediction-loss gradient via a sigmoid-like decaying parameter, guiding the decision optimization with the predictive loss. No extra training required and compatible with any DFL solver; includes a theoretical convergence guarantee to a Pareto stationary point.

Result: Empirical evaluation across three stochastic optimization problems shows lower regret and more stable training, outperforming baselines, especially where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient-perturbation approach provides a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded way to jointly consider prediction and decision objectives, improving robustness and performance without extra training.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

*Kosuke Kihara,Junki Mori,Taiki Miyagawa,Akinori F. Ebihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a frozen vision foundation model in CI-FFREEDA improves accuracy and efficiency, suggesting strong feature extractors are more impactful than complex FL/adaptation strategies in realistic, imbalanced, non-IID federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation under class imbalance and label shifts across source and target domains and among target clients, a setting where target data is unlabeled and servers have limited access to source data.

Method: Introduce CI-FFREEDA and substitute the FFREEDA backbone with a frozen Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Evaluate its ability to handle domain gaps, class imbalances, and non-IID client distributions while reducing tuning, computation, and communication costs.

Result: Vision Foundation Models effectively mitigate domain gaps, class imbalances, and non-IID-ness among target clients, yielding improved accuracy with less parameter tuning and lower computational/communication overhead.

Conclusion: Strong, fixed feature extractors (VFMs) are key to success in real-world FL, suggesting that leveraging frozen foundation models can outperform more complex adaptation or aggregation methods under realistic data skew and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

*Matan Avitan,Moran Baruch,Nir Drucker,Itamar Zimerman,Yoav Goldberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes HE-friendly argmax (cutmax) and an HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method to enable practical, privacy-preserving decoding in large language models. Both are polynomial-time and differentiable, with provable convergence guarantees and substantial latency reductions (24x–35x) over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure inference for LLMs on untrusted servers by solving the decoding bottleneck under homomorphic encryption. Traditional argmax and sampling are non-polynomial and prohibitively slow when data remain encrypted, hindering privacy-preserving AI.

Method: Introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations; develop the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method that leverages cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding; both approaches are polynomial-time and differentiable to support gradient-based sequence optimization; provide strong theoretical guarantees: cutmax converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of input values beyond the maximizer identity.

Result: Demonstrate substantial latency reductions of 24x–35x over baselines in realistic LLM outputs, enabling practical secure text generation with privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed HE-friendly decoding techniques transform privacy-preserving LLM inference by delivering polynomial-time, differentiable decoding with strong convergence guarantees, enabling efficient and private sequence generation on encrypted data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

*Xunkai Li,Daohan Su,Sicheng Liu,Ru Zhang,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT introduces a two-pronged mitigation (Information Tinker and Regularization Tinker) to address two domain-generalization pitfalls in Graph Foundation Models (model degradation and representation collapse) via edge-level semantic fusion, mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing, and additional regularizations, achieving state-of-the-art across 22 datasets, 6 domains, in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Foundation Models struggle to generalize across domains due to two orthogonal pitfalls: Side 1 Model Degradation (encoder/codebook fail to capture input diversity) and Side 2 Representation Collapse (embedding/codebook lose semantic separability under narrow subspaces). These issues relate to information bottleneck and insufficient regularization, hindering cross-task generalization.

Method: MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) comprises (1) Information Tinker: edge-wise semantic fusion and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to boost information capacity; (2) Regularization Tinker: two additional regularizations to improve gradient supervision. The architecture scales with model size and adheres to GFM scaling laws, designed for multi-domain tag graphs.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 22 datasets across 6 domains shows MoT significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: MoT effectively mitigates the two pitfalls, enhances information capacity and gradient supervision, aligns with scaling laws for GFM, and improves cross-task generalization across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to improve physics event classification, interpretability, and integration of auxiliary textual/semantic information in high-energy physics data analysis.

Method: Fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based on LLaMa 3.2 and evaluate on pixelated detector data for electron/muon neutrino classification. Benchmark against state-of-the-art CNN architectures used in NOvA/DUNE, assessing classification performance (efficiency/purity) and interpretability, including the ability to incorporate textual/semantic information.

Result: VLMs outperform CNNs in classification and offer greater flexibility to incorporate auxiliary textual/semantic information, with more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions.

Conclusion: Vision-language models can serve as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, delivering high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, and enabling multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

*Patrick J. Laub,Tu Pho,Bernard Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable neural additive model for insurance pricing (ANAM) that allocates dedicated subnetworks to each covariate and their pairwise interactions, enforcing sparsity, smoothness, and monotonicity to achieve transparency without sacrificing predictive power; it outperforms traditional methods on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the tension between interpretability and predictive accuracy in insurance pricing by defining interpretability in the actuarial context and providing a mathematically grounded framework.

Method: Constructs a neural additive model where each covariate and pairwise interaction has its own subnetwork; applies architectural constraints (sparsity, smoothness, monotonicity) and a rigorous interpretability definition; compares against traditional actuarial models and state-of-the-art ML on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Outperforms other methods in most cases while maintaining complete transparency of its internal logic; demonstrates strong predictive performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: ANAM delivers interpretable, accurate pricing models for general insurance, with a formal interpretability framework and practical constraints enabling adoption in actuarial practice.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

### [144] [SHAining on Process Mining: Explaining Event Log Characteristics Impact on Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08482)
*Andrea Maldonado,Christian M. M. Frey,Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula,Ludwig Zellner,Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SHAining to quantify marginal contributions of event log characteristics to process mining metrics; analyzes 22k logs to identify which characteristics drive metrics like fitness, precision, and complexity and how these effects relate to robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event log characteristics co-occur in real processes, and algorithm evaluations vary widely depending on these structures. Prior work uses fixed logs and often ignores associational effects, limiting generalizability. A systematic marginal-impact analysis is needed to understand robustness and guide evaluation practices.

Method: Define SHAining to measure the marginal contribution of individual log characteristics to process mining metrics, using process discovery as the downstream task. Analyze over 22,000 event logs spanning diverse log characteristics; treat effects as associational rather than causal; quantify impact across metrics (fitness, precision, complexity) and examine correlations between characteristic values and their contributed impact.

Result: Identified which log characteristics most consistently affect metrics across algorithms; quantified how characteristic values correlate with their impact; provided insights into algorithm robustness under varying log structures; demonstrated broad coverage across metrics using a large, diverse log set.

Conclusion: SHAining enables systematic, non-causal marginal analysis of log-characteristic effects on process mining evaluations, offering guidance for robust algorithm assessment and highlighting the characteristics that practitioners should consider when interpreting metric results.

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

### [145] [Modified Loss of Momentum Gradient Descent: Fine-Grained Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08483)
*Matias D. Cattaneo,Boris Shigida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HB momentum with small steps is equivalent to plain GD on a modified loss on an exponentially attractive invariant manifold; the modified loss can be approximated to arbitrary order in the step size h; reveals beta-polynomials (including Eulerian and Narayana) in memory terms; derives continuous modified equations and a principal flow; results apply to both full-batch and mini-batch HB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously understand how Polyak momentum influences gradient descent, quantify memory effects, and connect discrete HB dynamics to a gradient descent on a modified objective across batch settings.

Method: Build on Kovachki and Stuart (2021); show that on an exponentially attractive invariant manifold the HB updates collapse to plain GD on a modified loss for small step size h; derive high-order O(h^R) approximations (R≥2) with no closed form but arbitrarily precise descriptions; analyze the combinatorics of memoryless HB approximations to reveal a family of beta-polynomials including Eulerian and Narayana; derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary order and the principal flow extending Rosca et al. (2023); provide approximation theorems for both full-batch and mini-batch HB.

Result: Demonstrates exact equivalence to GD on a modified loss on the invariant manifold for small h; provides global approximation bounds of order h^R for any R≥2; uncovers a rich beta-polynomial structure governing memory effects (Eulerian, Narayana); develops higher-order continuous modified equations and a principal flow; extends results to both full-batch and mini-batch HB; offers a rigorous framework for understanding HB dynamics.

Conclusion: The work deepens the theoretical understanding of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, offering a rigorous modified-loss perspective, high-order approximations, and a roadmap for analyzing other optimization algorithms.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

### [146] [Heart Disease Prediction: A Comparative Study of Optimisers Performance in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08499)
*Chisom Chibuike,Adeyinka Ogunsanya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative study of 10 optimizers for training a simple MLP on a heart-disease dataset shows RMSProp as the best-balanced choice, balancing convergence speed and predictive metrics, with trade-offs noted for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizer choice is relatively underexplored compared to model architectures; selecting the right optimizer and evaluation metrics can meaningfully affect training performance and generalization.

Method: Train a simple Multi-layer Perceptron on a Kaggle heart disease dataset under a consistent training paradigm, comparing 10 different optimizers. Evaluate convergence speed, stability, and standard ML metrics such as AUC, precision, and recall.

Result: There are trade-offs between convergence speed and stability: Adagrad and Adadelta are more stable but slower to converge. Across metrics, RMSProp provides the most balanced performance, achieving precision 0.765, recall 0.827, and AUC 0.841, with faster training time but not the most stable. Other optimizers show varying strengths.

Conclusion: For compute-constrained settings, a thorough optimizer evaluation should be adopted to improve rigor and performance. RMSProp is recommended for balanced performance on this task, though the best choice may vary by dataset and compute constraints.

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

*Alicia Tierz,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid VRRAE-DeepONet framework uses a truncated-SVD latent space for continuous, interpretable representations, enabling efficient, accurate generation and gradient prediction for complex thermal designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative models (AEs/VAEs) which create unstructured latent spaces that hinder exploration and physical consistency.

Method: Introduce Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with a truncated SVD in the latent space to produce continuous, interpretable representations and mitigate posterior collapse; integrate with DeepONet where the branch network consumes the latent encoding and the trunk network uses spatial coordinates to predict temperature gradients.

Result: Improved geometry generation quality and gradient prediction accuracy, with substantially faster inference than traditional numerical solvers; demonstrates the value of structured latent representations for operator learning and the potential of combining generative models with operator networks.

Conclusion: Structured latent representations are essential for effective operator learning; combining generative models with operator networks offers a promising approach for thermal design and broader engineering applications.

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

### [148] [Data Skeleton Learning: Scalable Active Clustering with Sparse Graph Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08530)
*Wen-Bo Xie,Xun Fu,Bin Chen,Yan-Li Lee,Tao Deng,Tian Zou,Xin Wang,Zhen Liu,Jaideep Srivastavad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based active clustering method using two sparse graphs (a data skeleton and an update graph) to improve efficiency, scalability, and reduce annotation needs, while achieving accurate, nested clusters across various distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the efficiency, scalability, and memory constraints of pairwise constraint-based active clustering on large-scale data, aiming to reduce annotation effort and enable practical deployment.

Method: Proposes a two-graph framework: (1) a data skeleton graph that encodes data relationships; (2) an update graph that refines the skeleton. Together they iteratively refine connected subgraphs into nested clusters, enabling scalable, constraint-efficient clustering.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the method yields more accurate clustering with dramatically fewer user-provided constraints, while outperforming baselines in computational efficiency and scalability and maintaining robustness across different distance metrics.

Conclusion: The two-graph active clustering framework delivers improved efficiency, scalability, and robustness, with reduced annotation and memory requirements for large-scale clustering tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

### [149] [MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578)
*Hong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO introduces a multi-modal adaptive ensemble for influenza forecasting that fuses surveillance, web trends, and weather via spectro-temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art fit (R^2=0.956) on 11-year HK data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health decision-making requires timely, robust forecasts that leverage diverse data streams; existing methods often rely on single modalities or static architectures. MAESTRO aims to improve robustness and accuracy by adaptive fusion of multiple data sources with a rich spectro-temporal model.

Method: Decompose time series into seasonal and trend; process via Transformer encoders, Mamba state-space model, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain module; cross-channel attention to fuse modalities; temporal projection head for seq-to-seq forecasting; optional uncertainty estimator; public reusable pipeline.

Result: On 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding COVID-19 period), MAESTRO achieves competitive performance with a state-of-the-art R^2 of 0.956; ablations show contributions of multi-modal fusion and spectro-temporal components; pipeline is modular and publicly available.

Conclusion: Spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal fusion yield robust, accurate influenza forecasts; the framework is extensible to other regions and pathogens and supports uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

### [150] [Interpretability as Alignment: Making Internal Understanding a Design Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08592)
*Aadit Sengupta,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretability, especially mechanistic approaches, should be a core design principle for AI alignment, not just a diagnostic tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes deployments raise the risk of misalignment; post-hoc explanations are limited and potentially misleading. Mechanistic interpretability can reveal causal internal failures (e.g., deceptive or misaligned reasoning) and support safer, auditable systems.

Method: Advocates treating interpretability as a design objective. Compares post-hoc methods (LIME/SHAP) with mechanistic techniques (circuit tracing, activation patching). Discusses how mechanistic insights can uncover failures that behavioral methods (RLHF, red teaming, Constitutional AI) may miss. Addresses challenges (scalability, epistemic uncertainty, misalignment between representations and human concepts) and outlines a research-and-development agenda.

Result: Framed as a conceptual position paper: argues for making interpretability a first-class objective, with mechanistic methods providing causal insights into internal behavior and alignment, rather than relying solely on post-hoc explanations.

Conclusion: Safe and trustworthy AI depends on interpretability being central to design and governance, enabling auditable, transparent systems aligned with human intent.

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

### [151] [Classification of 24-hour movement behaviors from wrist-worn accelerometer data: from handcrafted features to deep learning techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08606)
*Alireza Sameh,Mehrdad Rostami,Mourad Oussalah,Vahid Farrahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DL and classical ML show similar accuracy for classifying 24-hour movement behavior; DL on raw signals yields ~85% accuracy, handcrafted features yield 70–81% across models; MVPA/LPA are more often confused; DL with raw data offers only marginal improvement over handcrafted features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether deep learning on raw wrist-worn accelerometer data provides meaningful gains over classical ML and handcrafted features for classifying 24-hour movement categories (sleep, sedentary, LPA, MVPA).

Method: Dataset: open-access AX3 wrist accelerometer data from 151 adults, split into training (121), validation (15), and test (15) participants. Signals segmented into 10-second windows; 104 handcrafted features extracted. DL models (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN) trained on raw signals and on handcrafted features. Classical ML models (RF, SVM, XGBoost, LR, ANN, DT) trained on handcrafted features. Classification target: four movement categories (sleep, sedentary, LPA, MVPA).

Result: When trained on raw signals, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU achieved ~85% overall accuracy; 1D-CNN ~80%. When trained on handcrafted features, accuracy ranged from 70% to 81% across both DL and classical ML methods. MVPA and LPA were generally more confused with each other than with sleep or sedentary classes.

Conclusion: DL using raw signals provides only a slight improvement over models trained on handcrafted features; overall performance is similar between DL and classical ML when handcrafted features are used, suggesting limited advantage of DL for this task and highlighting persistent confusion between MVPA and LPA.

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

### [152] [Towards Interpretable Deep Neural Networks for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08617)
*Khawla Elhadri,Jörg Schlötterer,Christin Seifert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XNNTab uses a sparse autoencoder to build a dictionary of semantically meaningful latent features for tabular data, enabling predictions as linear combinations of interpretable components while achieving competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting tabular neural networks is challenging; there is a need for models whose latent features have human-understandable semantics to improve transparency and trust.

Method: Train a sparse autoencoder to learn a dictionary of monosemantic latent features; automatically assign human-interpretable semantics to these features; perform predictions as linear combinations of these semantically meaningful components.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that XNNTab matches or exceeds state-of-the-art black-box neural models and classical ML baselines while remaining fully interpretable.

Conclusion: XNNTab demonstrates that interpretable neural architectures for tabular data can achieve competitive performance by organizing latent space into semantically meaningful components and using linear prediction over them.

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

### [153] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-dependent per-point sharp upper bound on silhouette width is derived, yielding a dataset-wide ASW bound often well below 1. This enables early stopping, assessment of how close clustering is to the best possible outcome on the data, and tighter cluster quality evaluation; bounds are near-tight on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASW's theoretical max of 1 is often unattainable and the true dataset-specific maximum is unknown. There is a need for bounds that are tailored to the data to evaluate quality, guide optimization, and judge proximity to the optimum.

Method: Derive a sharp per-point upper bound on each point's silhouette width; aggregate these to obtain a canonical data-dependent bound on ASW; support theoretical properties (near-tightness) and empirical validation on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: The derived bounds are typically much lower than 1, providing a meaningful data-dependent ceiling for ASW; they help identify points that cannot be well-placed, enable early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and quantify how close the clustering result is to the best possible outcome on the given data.

Conclusion: The proposed data-dependent bounds enrich cluster quality evaluation and optimization by offering principled, dataset-specific limits, enabling more informed and reliable clustering decisions.

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

### [154] [Generative Data Refinement: Just Ask for Better Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08653)
*Minqi Jiang,João G. M. Araújo,Will Ellsworth,Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative Data Refinement (GDR) uses pretrained generative models to clean and extend training data by generating conditioned synthetic data, improving privacy/anonymization and detoxification while matching web-scale diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data growth outpaces indexing and web-scale data is insufficient; unindexed user-generated content is abundant but risky (privacy, unsafe content); better data quality and safety are crucial for training large models.

Method: Introduce GDR: transform datasets with undesirable content into refined datasets using pretrained generative models; optionally generate synthetic data conditioned on each real example to preserve diversity; apply anonymization/detoxification prior to training.

Result: GDR outperforms industry-grade anonymization solutions and enables detoxification of highly unsafe datasets; conditioned synthetic data aligns with the diversity of web-scale data, avoiding complex prompting for diversity.

Conclusion: GDR is a simple, effective tool to scale training data for frontier models by refining data with generative models, reducing risk and increasing data utility.

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

### [155] [Replicable Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08660)
*Eric Eaton,Marcel Hussing,Michael Kearns,Aaron Roth,Sikata Bela Sengupta,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops the first provably efficient replicable algorithms for linear-function reinforcement learning (RL), introducing two replicable methods for random-design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, then combining them to obtain provably replicable RL algorithms for linear MDPs in both generative and episodic settings, with experiments suggesting more consistent neural policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicability in ML is challenging and crucial for reliable science; RL in particular is unstable, and extending replicability guarantees from tabular to function-approximation settings addresses a key gap and could yield more stable, reusable policies.

Method: Introduce two efficient replicable algorithms: (1) replicable random-design regression and (2) uncentered covariance estimation. Use these building blocks to construct provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both generative-model and episodic settings.

Result: Provide the first provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear MDPs in both generative and episodic settings; empirical evaluation demonstrates replicability and suggests these methods can improve consistency of policies, including neural ones.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that replicability can be achieved in RL with function approximation, offering a blueprint for stable policy learning and motivating future extensions to broader function-approximation settings (e.g., nonlinear or neural networks).

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and

*Jingya Cheng,Jiazi Tian,Federica Spoto,Alaleh Azhir,Daniel Mork,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFI quantifies patient-level diagnostic data quality and, via SFI-aware calibration, improves cross-institution dementia prediction in label-free settings; notable gains in recall, precision, and F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnostic signal decay creates distributional shift in EHR-based models; a label-free method to assess data quality and calibrate models can enhance generalization across healthcare systems.

Method: Simulated 2,500 synthetic dementia datasets (1,000 patients each). SFI built from six components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, trajectory stability. Applied multiplicative calibration with parameter alpha optimized over 50 simulation batches.

Result: At alpha=2.0, SFI-aware calibration significantly improved metrics (p<0.001). Gains: Balanced Accuracy +10.3%, Recall +32.5%, Precision +31.9%, F1 +26.1%. F1-score and Recall within 1% of reference; Balanced Accuracy and Detection Rate up 52.3% and 41.1%.

Conclusion: SFI-aware calibration is a practical, label-free strategy to mitigate diagnostic signal decay and improve cross-site model performance, especially for large administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

### [157] [Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08683)
*Delio Jaramillo-Velez,Charul Rajput,Ragnar Freij-Hollanti,Camilla Hollanti,Alexandre Graell i Amat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A torus-based secure aggregation method for federated learning achieves perfect privacy without accuracy loss, outperforming finite-field methods in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated learning, secure aggregation via MPC aims for perfect privacy by masking model parameters. Real-valued data complicates uniform masking on reals, leading to potential leakage. Finite-field conversions introduce fixed-point accuracy tradeoffs. A privacy-preserving approach that preserves accuracy is needed.

Method: Proposes masking on the torus with a uniform distribution to achieve perfect privacy while avoiding accuracy loss. This avoids real-to-integer quantization issues present in finite-field schemes. Experimental evaluation compares torus-based SEC to finite-field SEC and non-secure baselines, using metrics like accuracy and cosine similarity.

Result: The torus-based protocol achieves privacy without compromising accuracy and can match or exceed the performance of non-secure baselines. In some scenarios, it significantly outperforms finite-field secure aggregation in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity.

Conclusion: Torus-based secure aggregation provides a safer choice for privacy-preserving federated learning by delivering perfect privacy without accuracy loss and, in certain cases, superior performance to finite-field methods.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

### [158] [Reshaping the Forward-Forward Algorithm with a Similarity-Based Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08697)
*James Gong,Raymond Luo,Emma Wang,Leon Ge,Bruce Li,Felix Marattukalam,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAUST is a Forward-Forward-based training method augmented with a similarity-based tuplet loss to eliminate the need for multiple forward passes at inference and to close the accuracy gap with backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation suffers from backward locking and global error propagation, while the original Forward-Forward (FF) method trades accuracy and inference efficiency for biological plausibility. There is a need to maintain a single forward pass during inference while boosting accuracy.

Method: Integrate the Forward-Forward framework with a similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). This leverages similarity learning to shape activations without backpropagation, enabling high accuracy in a single forward-pass inference. Evaluations were conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using an MLP architecture.

Result: FAUST substantially improves FF accuracy and narrows the gap to backpropagation. On CIFAR-10 with a simple MLP, it reaches 56.22% accuracy, close to the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63%.

Conclusion: FAUST represents a meaningful step toward more biologically plausible yet competitive training by removing multiple forward passes during inference and approaching BP performance, suggesting potential for more efficient, hardware-friendly learning.

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

*Thorsten Wittkopp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-layer AIOps framework for DevOps log analysis: Log Investigation with autonomous labeling and anomaly taxonomy; flexible Anomaly Detection; Root Cause Analysis using minimal log sets, achieving high detection accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increase stability and reliability in complex IT systems by automating log analysis to aid DevOps in failure resolution and maintenance, reducing manual labeling and accelerating root-cause diagnosis.

Method: Proposes a three-layer architecture. Layer 1 Log Investigation: autonomous log labeling and anomaly classification plus a taxonomy of anomalies (three categories) to guide method selection. Layer 2 Anomaly Detection: a flexible method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised, and supervised training. Layer 3 Root Cause Analysis: identifies minimal log sets describing failures, their origin, and event sequences; balances training data and highlights key services; aims to surface root-cause log lines within the top 10 candidates.

Result: Evaluations on public and industry datasets show high anomaly detection performance with F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0. Root Cause Analysis identifies 90–98% of root-cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, offering actionable mitigation insights.

Conclusion: Integrating the three-layer architecture equips DevOps with robust log-analysis methods to resolve failures efficiently and improve IT system reliability.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

### [160] [Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Speech Arrest During Direct Cortical Stimulation Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08703)
*Nikasadat Emami,Amirhossein Khalilian-Gourtani,Jianghao Qian,Antoine Ratouchniak,Xupeng Chen,Yao Wang,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An ECoG-based ML approach identifies critical speech-related cortical regions by predicting ESM-determined speech arrest; combines anatomical region labels with functional connectivity; best model uses an RBF SVM with MLP-based aggregation, achieving ROC-AUC 0.87 on held-out participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe presurgical mapping for language areas is clinically essential. Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) is invasive and time-consuming; a non-invasive or less invasive predictive model based on intracranial recordings could streamline planning and reduce risk.

Method: Analyze intracranial ECoG data from 16 participants performing speech tasks. Ground truth labels of speech arrest derived from ESM used to train classifiers. Features include local neural activity, anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity. Trial-level predictions per electrode are aggregated with an MLP on histogram-encoded scores. The best approach is an RBF-kernel SVM with MLP-based aggregation.

Result: Models that combine region labels with connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature set and outperformed models using either type alone. On held-out participants, the best model achieved ROC-AUC 0.87 and PR-AUC 0.57.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial (region) and network (connectivity) information with non-linear modeling improves functional mapping for presurgical evaluation, potentially reducing reliance on invasive ESM and aiding safer brain surgery near language areas.

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

### [161] [DEQuify your force field: More efficient simulations using deep equilibrium models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08734)
*Andreas Burger,Luca Thiede,Alán Aspuru-Guzik,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep equilibrium model is used to exploit temporal continuity in molecular dynamics, reusing features from previous steps to improve accuracy and speed by 10-20% on MD17/MD22/OC20 200k, with memory-efficient training enabling larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although ML force fields leverage physical symmetries, MD is continuous, so successive states are very similar. The work argues that temporal continuity is a meaningful prior and shows how to exploit it by turning a state-of-the-art equivariant base model into a deep equilibrium model (DEQ).

Method: Recast the equivariant base model as a DEQ and recycle intermediate neural-network features from previous time steps during inference/training to accelerate computation and improve accuracy.

Result: Achieves 10-20% gains in accuracy and speed on MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets compared to the non-DEQ base model; training is more memory-efficient, enabling larger, more expressive models on bigger systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal continuity via deep equilibrium modeling is an effective prior for ML force fields, yielding speedups, accuracy gains, and better scalability over traditional non-DEQ, even with strong symmetry-based inductive biases.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

### [162] [Securing Private Federated Learning in a Malicious Setting: A Scalable TEE-Based Approach with Client Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08709)
*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a maliciously secure DP-FTRL by using a server-side ephemeral TEE-based TCB that produces verifiable proofs of server actions; selected clients audit these proofs with low overhead, enabling malicious-threat privacy guarantees, while preserving scalability and liveness; supported by formal interactive-differential-privacy proofs and practical experiments showing small client overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-FTRL typically assumes a semi-honest server; in practice servers can be dropped, corrupted, or stateful issues arise. TEEs alone can lead to forking/availability problems. There is a need for malicious-security with auditable proofs that scales.

Method: Proposes a server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB) implemented via an ephemeral TEE module on the server. It produces verifiable proofs of server actions. A subset of clients participates in auditing these proofs with modest additional communication and computation. Provides formal proofs under interactive differential privacy and aims to preserve liveness and scalability.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows the framework incurs only a small constant overhead for clients across realistic settings, while reducing the effective TCB size and maintaining privacy guarantees under malicious threat models.

Conclusion: The work delivers a practically secure DP-FTRL framework that tolerates malicious servers through a lightweight, auditable TCB built on ephemeral TEEs, backed by formal privacy guarantees and empirical evidence of low client overhead.

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces AgentGym-RL for training multi-turn, decision-making LLM agents via reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning; adds ScalingInter-RL to balance exploitation-exploration; demonstrates strong performance across 27 tasks; open-source plan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of unified, interactive RL framework to train autonomous LLM agents from scratch across diverse, realistic environments; need to move beyond supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes AgentGym-RL—a modular, decoupled framework supporting various real-world scenarios and mainstream RL algorithms; introduces ScalingInter-RL—a curriculum-like training approach that starts with limited interactions (exploitation) and gradually extends horizons to encourage exploration and diversify strategies.

Result: Agents match or exceed commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments; validated stability and effectiveness of both framework and training approach; promise to open-source code and datasets.

Conclusion: AgentGym-RL and ScalingInter-RL advance autonomous LLM agent research by providing a flexible, scalable RL framework; potential to accelerate development of next-generation intelligent agents; will be open-sourced to support the research community.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

*Ahmed Sadaqa,Di Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid pruning framework combines channel and layer pruning to compress CNNs, reversing EfficientNet's scaling paradigm; achieves significant complexity reduction with only small accuracy loss and lower edge-device latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing CNN complexity makes deployment on edge devices difficult; model compression via pruning (channel and layer pruning) seeks to reduce size and compute while preserving performance.

Method: Proposes a hybrid pruning framework that prunes both channels and layers in a unified approach, inspired by EfficientNet's scaling but applied in reverse to prune networks; demonstrates the approach on practical hardware.

Result: Notable decrease in model complexity with only minor accuracy reduction; observed latency reductions when deployed on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

Conclusion: Hybrid pruning is effective for edge deployment, enabling smaller, faster CNNs with minimal accuracy compromise.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep RL-based decision-support AI (MasTER) improves MCI patient transfer decisions; in a 30-participant study across 20- and 60-patient MCIs, AI-assisted options outperform surgeons and enable non-experts to reach expert-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents overwhelm healthcare systems; rapid, accurate patient-hospital allocation is critical. Human-only decision making is limited under extreme pressure; an AI-driven system can optimize allocations by balancing patient acuity, care requirements, hospital capacity, and transport logistics.

Method: Developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning agent for transfer decisions, integrated into MasTER, a web-based dashboard. Conducted a controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts, 24 non-experts) evaluating three interaction modes (human-only, human-AI collaboration, AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Measured decision quality and consistency; reported statistical significance (p<0.001).

Result: The AI agent improved decision quality and consistency, outperforming trauma surgeons (p<0.001). When assisted, non-experts reached expert-level performance; unassisted non-experts were significantly inferior (p<0.001). The MasTER system supports MCI preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Conclusion: AI-driven decision support has strong potential to enhance MCI preparedness, training, and real-world emergency management. MasTER enables scalable simulations and rapid, reliable patient-to-hospital transfer decisions under extreme conditions.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

TL;DR: SAPO is a decentralized, asynchronous RL post-training method for LMs that eliminates scaling bottlenecks by distributing learning across heterogeneous nodes while sharing rollouts; it achieves up to 94% cumulative reward gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement-learning-based post-training can boost LM reasoning but requires heavy parallelization, creating latency, memory, reliability challenges, and high costs. A scalable, decentralized approach is needed to enable efficient RL fine-tuning of large models.

Method: SAPO enables fully decentralized RL post-training: each node maintains its own policy model(s) and runs local rollouts; rollouts are shared across the network; no assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware; nodes can operate in silo if desired; sampling across nodes propagates insights and 'Aha moments' to bootstrap learning; demonstrated on networks with thousands of nodes in an open-source demo by the Gensyn community.

Result: In controlled experiments, SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94%; tested on networks with thousands of nodes across diverse hardware and models via an open-source demo.

Conclusion: SAPO mitigates scaling bottlenecks in RL post-training for LMs, enabling scalable, decentralized learning and faster propagation of insights, with broad hardware compatibility and tolerance for siloed operation.

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

*Xuefeng Gao,Jiale Zha,Xun Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-free diffusion-model framework to generate synthetic sample paths for unknown SDEs from observed data, with benchmarking against neural SDEs and application to finance-focused RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown or partially specified SDEs are common in practice; traditional Monte Carlo requires explicit drift/diffusion terms and can be limited. A data-driven, flexible path generator could better capture dynamics and aid downstream tasks like optimization and decision making.

Method: Train conditional diffusion models on a finite set of observed SDE paths to produce new synthetic paths of the same SDE without needing explicit coefficients; compare performance with benchmarks (including neural SDEs) through simulation experiments; apply synthetic paths to enhance reinforcement learning for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio optimization.

Result: The approach demonstrates competitive performance relative to baselines in simulation and yields improved reinforcement learning outcomes when augmented with synthetic paths, illustrating the viability of diffusion-models for SDE path generation.

Conclusion: Diffusion models offer a promising, model-free framework for generating SDE sample paths from data, with practical implications for financial analysis and decision-making tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevailing single-teacher assumption for CoT distillation can underutilize diverse reasoning abilities; different students (and datasets) may benefit from different teachers. Leveraging multiple candidate teachers could improve robustness, reduce overfitting, and raise performance ceilings, but naive aggregation risks conflicts in supervision.

Method: Train teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches on the student, each guided by a different teacher; then merge the resulting student variants in weight space (Merge-of-Thought). The approach alternates between branches and a final/iterative weight-space merge, using a small high-quality CoT corpus (~200 samples) for supervision.

Result: On competition math benchmarks, MoT with a Qwen3-14B student outperforms strong bases such as DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1. It consistently beats the best single-teacher distillation and the naive multi-teacher union, increases the performance ceiling, mitigates overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution shifts and to peer-level teachers. It also reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics, and even makes the student a better teacher, suggesting transferability of consensus-filtered reasoning features.

Conclusion: MoT provides a simple, scalable framework to efficiently distill long CoT reasoning from diverse teachers into compact students. Its weight-space merging of teacher-specific variants offers robust gains with limited data and appears to generalize across tasks, potentially enabling broader benefits from consensus-driven reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemBOMAS uses an LLM-enhanced, two-stage Bayesian optimization framework to accelerate chemical discovery: a knowledge-driven coarse search to identify promising regions and a data-driven fine-grained stage to generate pseudo-data within those regions, achieving substantial improvements and validated by wet-lab experiments (96% objective vs 15% by domain experts).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization in chemistry is hampered by sparse data and complex reaction mechanisms; there is a need to leverage language models and chemical knowledge to more efficiently explore search spaces and utilize data.

Method: Two-stage optimization: (1) knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization where LLMs and chemical knowledge decompose the search space to identify promising regions; (2) data-driven fine-grained optimization where LLMs generate pseudo-data within those regions to enhance BO data efficiency; benchmark tests plus wet-lab validation in pharmaceutical-relevant conditions.

Result: ChemBOMAS markedly improves optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared with various BO algorithms; in wet-lab experiments on a previously unreported reaction, it achieved an optimal objective value of 96% versus 15% achieved by domain experts.

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS demonstrates a powerful, real-world-capable approach that combines LLM-driven space decomposition with pseudo-data augmentation to accelerate chemical discovery, validated both on benchmarks and in practical laboratory experiments.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

### [170] [PracMHBench: Re-evaluating Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning Based on Practical Edge Device Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08750)
*Yuanchun Guo,Bingyan Liu,Yulong Sha,Zhensheng Xian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First system platform PracMHBench to evaluate model-heterogeneous federated learning (FL) on edge devices under practical constraints. It classifies and tests heterogeneous-model algorithms across various data tasks and metrics, and conducts extensive experiments to reveal applicability and heterogeneity patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-heterogeneous FL is more practical for edge devices, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis under realistic edge constraints. This motivates building an evaluation platform to rethink and compare such algorithms.

Method: Construct PracMHBench platform; classify diverse model-heterogeneity algorithms; evaluate them on multiple data tasks and metrics; conduct extensive experiments under varying edge constraints to observe applicability and heterogeneity patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on the platform show the applicability of different heterogeneity algorithms and reveal corresponding heterogeneity patterns across tasks and edge constraints.

Conclusion: PracMHBench enables systematic evaluation of model-heterogeneous FL under practical edge constraints, providing empirical insights into when and why certain algorithms work and exposing heterogeneity patterns across data tasks and resource settings.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

### [171] [Fourier Learning Machines: Nonharmonic Fourier-Based Neural Networks for Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08759)
*Mominul Rubel,Adam Meyers,Gabriel Nicolosi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Fourier Learning Machine (FLM) is a cosine-activated feedforward neural network that learns multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier series by training frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts. It forms a problem-specific, complete separable Fourier basis adaptable to periodic and nonperiodic functions, realized within a standard MLP-like architecture. It establishes a one-to-one mapping between Fourier coefficients and cosine parameters and shows competitive or superior performance to SIREN and vanilla NNs on PDEs and optimal control problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a flexible, learnable spectral basis capable of representing a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions within a standard neural-network architecture. This addresses limitations of prior Fourier-inspired networks and aims to improve performance on scientific computing tasks.

Method: A simple feedforward network using cosine activation functions learns frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts as trainable parameters. It constructs a problem-specific, complete separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions, with a one-to-one correspondence between Fourier coefficients and amplitude/phase parameters. The architecture supports conversion between a full Fourier-basis representation and a cosine-phase form. The approach is evaluated on benchmark PDEs and a family of optimal control problems, with comparisons to SIREN and vanilla feedforward networks.

Result: Empirical results show FLM achieving performance comparable to or superior to SIREN and vanilla NNs on the tested PDEs and OCPs. It demonstrates the feasibility of representing a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions within a standard MLP-like network.

Conclusion: FLM provides a flexible, adaptive spectral representation for learning multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier series, enabling problem-specific bases and broad applicability in scientific computing. It is the first architecture to represent a complete separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions using a standard MLP-like architecture, with a clear one-to-one mapping between Fourier coefficients and the cosine-activation parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

*Ali Amini,Mohammad Alijanpour,Behnam Latifi,Ali Motie Nasrabadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces ADHDeepNet, a deep learning model for ADHD/HC classification from EEG signals using temporal-spatial features, attention, and explainability, achieving near-perfect metrics on 121 participants with robust cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, accurate ADHD diagnosis is crucial to reduce social, academic, and healthcare burdens, but current diagnosis is labor-intensive; leveraging EEG with DL could improve speed and precision.

Method: A two-stage DL framework (ADHDeepNet) with comprehensive temporal-spatial EEG feature extraction, attention modules, and explainability techniques. Training uses nested 10-fold cross-subject validation with inner 2-fold CV for hyper-parameter tuning, and additive Gaussian noise data augmentation at multiple SDs and magnification levels. Evaluation includes analysis of learned weights/activations and t-SNE visualization.

Result: ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in ADHD/HC classification on 121 participants; robustness is supported by nested CV; model explainability identifies key brain regions/frequency bands via weight/activation analysis and visualized using t-SNE.

Conclusion: DL+EEG is a promising path to more accurate and efficient ADHD diagnosis, with explainable models that highlight neurophysiological correlates and regional/frequency importance; the approach demonstrates strong potential for clinical deployment, pending further validation.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.
