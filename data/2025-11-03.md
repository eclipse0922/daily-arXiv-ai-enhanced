### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench is a benchmark and data-synthesis pipeline for visual measurement reading, revealing that current vision-language models struggle with precise spatial grounding, especially indicator localization; preliminary reinforcement learning on synthetic data yields limited real-world gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between numeracy (reading numbers) and precise spatial perception in vision-language models; address the lack of scalable, varied, ground-truth data for measurement reading tasks.

Method: Introduce MeasureBench with real and synthetic images, plus a pipeline that procedurally generates gauges with controllable visual features (pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, clutter). Evaluate multiple VLMs (proprietary/open-weight) and perform preliminary reinforcement learning experiments on synthetic data.

Result: VLMs show strong general capabilities but fail at measurement reading; the main failure mode is indicator localization, reading digits/labels without correctly locating pointers/alignments, causing large numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning; in-domain synthetic RL shows promise, real-world gains are limited.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have a fundamental limitation in fine-grained spatial grounding for numeracy tasks. MeasureBench provides a resource to spur progress in visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive 3D TransUNet for proximal femur segmentation in QCT reduces cross-site performance drop by combining adversarial site alignment (GRL) with distribution matching (MMD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift across scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics leads to unstable segmentation and unreliable quantitative metrics, hindering multi-center osteoporosis research and reproducibility of radiomics/finite-element analyses.

Method: A 3D TransUNet backbone with dual-domain adaptation: (1) Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) for adversarial alignment to remove site-specific cues, and (2) Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for statistical alignment to minimize distribution differences between Tulane (1,024 scans) and Rochester, MN (384 scans) in proximal femur segmentation.

Result: Dual alignment strategy fosters scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail, improving cross-institution generalization and reliability of quantitative metrics for proximal femur QCT analysis.

Conclusion: The combination of GRL-based adversarial and MMD-based statistical alignment effectively mitigates domain shift in multi-center QCT segmentation, supporting reproducible radiomics and finite-element analyses across sites; extensibility to additional centers and anatomical regions is feasible.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces a Directional Consistency (DC) criterion into Adaptive Density Control (ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting. By leveraging angular coherence of gradients, it reduces redundancy in primitive splitting and aligns sub-primitives with local structures, achieving fewer primitives (up to 30% less) and higher reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ADC uses only the magnitude of positional gradients to decide splitting, which can cause redundant splits and fail to respect local structural directions. Incorporating directional information aims to capture structural complexities more efficiently and improve reconstruction quality.

Method: Compute the directional consistency (DC) of gradient fields via their angular coherence and integrate this DC into the ADC framework. Use DC to determine when to split and where to place split positions so sub-primitives align with local structures rather than being randomly placed, thereby guiding primitive division and alignment.

Result: Experimental results show a reduction in the number of primitives by up to 30% compared to conventional ADC, along with substantial improvements in reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Incorporating gradient directional coherence into ADC for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS) yields more efficient representations with fewer primitives and better reconstruction quality than traditional magnitude-based ADC.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

### [4] [Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26923)
*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) dynamically adjusts curriculum based on data scale to improve lung nodule detection in data-scarce settings, achieving comparable full-data performance to static curricula and notable gains when data is limited, without changing architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static curricula underperform when annotated data are scarce; robust medical detectors require training strategies that adapt to available data to leverage limited labels.

Method: SACL integrates adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization to modulate curriculum during training for lung nodule detection (LUNA25) with YOLOv11 as base detector.

Result: On full LUNA25 data, SACL matches static curriculum in mAP50. Under data-limited regimes (10%, 20%, 50% data), SACL yields improvements of 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% over the baseline, respectively.

Conclusion: SACL enables robust, data-efficient training for lung nodule detection without architectural changes, aiding healthcare institutions with limited annotation resources.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

### [5] [SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961)
*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, adaptive multi-stream network (SYNAPSE-Net) for heterogeneous brain lesion segmentation that integrates CNN encoders, a Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion, and a hierarchical decoder, trained with variance-reducing augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results across WMH, ISLES 2022, and BraTS 2020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI suffers from poor generalization and high performance variance among specialized models. A robust, generalizable solution is needed for reliable clinical deployment across diverse datasets and pathologies.

Method: A hybrid architecture (multi-stream CNN encoders + Swin Transformer bottleneck) with dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) and a hierarchical gated decoder. Training includes a variance reduction strategy combining pathology-specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling to improve generalization and robustness.

Result: Evaluated on three public datasets: WMH (MICCAI 2017) achieving DSC 0.831 and HD95 3.03; ISLES 2022 with best boundary accuracy (HD95 9.69); BraTS 2020 achieving tumor core DSC 0.8651. Reported state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies; code and pretrained models released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The proposed Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net delivers superior, robust segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions across different modalities and datasets, addressing generalization and reliability gaps in clinical neuroimaging; open-source availability facilitates adoption and replication.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAT improves live video comment generation by semantic frame aggregation and multimodal fusion using CLIP, plus a new large-scale English Twitch dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video commenting systems suffer from focusing on irrelevant frames and language/data biases; there is a need to prioritize frames that align with ongoing viewer interactions to generate contextually appropriate comments.

Method: SFAT uses CLIP-based multimodal knowledge to evaluate semantic relevance of frames to the chat, computes a weighted sum of frames to emphasize informative frames, and employs a cross-attention decoder that attends to both video frames and chat to generate comments. Additionally, a large-scale English Twitch dataset (11 categories, 438 hours, 3.2M comments) was constructed to address dataset limitations.

Result: The model demonstrates effectiveness compared to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts, validating both the SFAT approach and the new dataset.

Conclusion: SFAT effectively integrates semantic frame relevance and multimodal cues to produce contextually appropriate live video comments, and the dataset helps mitigate language/category biases, enabling broader evaluation and application.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts
(MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical
vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by
effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies
of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) for open-world HOI detection, addressing forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOIs in an incremental learning setup; shows improvements on HICO-DET and V-COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world HOI environments have evolving human-object interactions; conventional closed-world HOI detectors suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inability to adapt to new interactions and zero-shot combinations as data arrives sequentially.

Method: An exemplar-free incremental learning framework called IRD that decouples object and relation learning and introduces two distillation losses to preserve invariant relation features across HOI combinations sharing the same relation; operates without exemplars to mitigate memory constraints during continual learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO show that IRD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reducing forgetting, improving robustness to interaction drift, and generalizing to zero-shot HOIs.

Conclusion: IRD demonstrates that exemplar-free incremental relation distillation is effective for continual HOI learning in open-world scenarios, enabling robust, adaptable HOI detection as new data arrives.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

### [10] [AD-SAM: Fine-Tuning the Segment Anything Vision Foundation Model for Autonomous Driving Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27047)
*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned, dual-encoder, deformable-decoder extension of SAM for autonomous driving semantic segmentation. It fuses global context from SAM’s ViT-H with local detail from ResNet-50, uses deformable fusion and deformable attention, and employs a hybrid loss. It achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on Cityscapes and BDD100K, with strong data efficiency and fast convergence, indicating targeted foundation-model enhancements can improve AD perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate, data-efficient, scalable semantic segmentation tailored to autonomous driving, leveraging foundation models while incorporating road-scene geometry and boundary precision.

Method: Dual-encoder architecture (global ViT-H from SAM + local ResNet-50) with a deformable fusion module and a multi-stage, deformable-attention decoder. Training uses a hybrid loss (Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, Surface). Evaluation on Cityscapes and BDD100K; analysis includes cross-domain retention score and data efficiency (low-sample performance).

Result: AD-SAM achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, surpassing SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to ~23 mIoU in structured road scenes and ~19 mIoU in diverse scenes. Demonstrates faster convergence (30-40 epochs) and higher learning speed, plus data efficiency (0.607 mIoU with 1000 samples) and strong cross-domain retention (0.87 vs 0.76 for SAM).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models can enable reliable, scalable autonomous driving perception with improved accuracy, data efficiency, and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [11] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical transformer-based neural field (HiT) learns unsupervised, data-driven hierarchies for 3D shapes across multiple categories using a compressed codebook, enabling flexible, multi-level substructure discovery and unsupervised segmentation without fixed topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer general, scalable hierarchies among 3D shape substructures without imposing a fixed hierarchical topology, enabling cross-category understanding and segmentation.

Method: Introduce HiT, a hierarchical transformer where each level models parent-child relationships via a compressed codebook that captures common substructures. The codebook allows variable, data-driven hierarchies (no fixed binary constraint) with a limit on nodes per level. Trained with reconstruction loss on diverse shapes (55 ShapeNet categories).

Result: The model learns meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes and achieves unsupervised multi-level shape segmentation across many categories.

Conclusion: Flexibly learns data-driven hierarchies for 3D shapes, enabling deeper multi-scale segmentation and structure discovery without imposing strict hierarchical constraints.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

### [12] [ZEBRA: Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Subject Generalization for Universal Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27128)
*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA enables zero-shot brain-to-image decoding by disentangling subject-specific and semantic representations in fMRI, achieving competitive performance without subject-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI-to-image methods rely on subject-specific models or fine-tuning, hindering scalability and real-world applicability. A universal zero-shot decoder is highly desirable.

Method: Adversarially disentangle fMRI into subject-related and semantic-related components, isolating subject-invariant semantic representations to enable zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects without additional data or retraining.

Result: ZEBRA outperforms zero-shot baselines and matches or approaches fully finetuned models on multiple metrics across several experiments, demonstrating scalable universal decoding; code and weights are provided.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable path toward universal neural decoding, showing practical zero-shot generalization across subjects and moving toward real-world brain-to-vision interfaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

Motivation: 3DGS-based SLAM has excelled in small indoor scenes, but there is a lack of large-scale forest datasets. Collecting real-world data is costly; a high-quality synthetic dataset can enable research for forest mapping, wildfire response, and related tasks.

Method: Leverage Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment; develop a pipeline to collect aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities; provide controllable environment factors (lighting, weather, wildfire types); create WildfireX-SLAM and conduct a thorough benchmark.

Result: Produced WildfireX-SLAM: 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images over a 16 km^2 forest map; a comprehensive benchmark highlighting challenges and potential improvements for 3DGS-SLAM in forests; dataset and code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and value of high-quality synthetic data for advancing 3DGS-based SLAM in forest environments, with practical applications to wildfire emergency response and forest management; provides a public dataset and benchmark to spur future work.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 304M-parameter multimodal diffusion transformer (E-MMDiT) with strong token-compression and local-attention mechanisms achieves competitive 512px image synthesis using only 25M public data and modest compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models typically demand large datasets and heavy compute, or suffer from high latency; aim to democratize multimodal diffusion by reducing token counts and computational cost while preserving quality.

Method: Proposes E-MMDiT with compressive visual tokenizer, multi-path token compression, Position Reinforcement to strengthen positional cues, Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA) for local-attention to reduce compute, and AdaLN-affine for lightweight modulation. Trained on ~25M public images, 512px generation, 304M parameters, ~1.5 days on 8 AMD MI300X GPUs; code released.

Result: GenEval score of 0.66; with post-training GRPO up to 0.72; demonstrates efficient, lightweight diffusion for 512px images with competitive results on limited data and resources.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT offers a practical, reproducible baseline that democratizes generative AI research, balancing quality and efficiency; enables lower-barrier entry for multimodal diffusion development.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [15] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) to improve cross-view geo-localization, introduces a new Ground-to-Drone dataset (G2D), and achieves state-of-the-art results on CVOGL and G2D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view localization methods rely on attention to model spatial dependencies but struggle to transfer information between views and to refine spatial relationship maps, often focusing on edge noise and reducing localization accuracy. A mechanism for iterative cross-view information exchange and multi-scale spatial feature extraction is needed to robustly locate queried objects across views.

Method: Introduce Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) that performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views to enable continuous exchange of contextual information about the query object. Integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) that uses convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract multi-scale spatial features from feature maps with implicit correspondences. Create G2D dataset for Ground-to-Drone localization. Evaluate on CVOGL and G2D datasets.

Result: Methods achieve high localization accuracy and surpass current state-of-the-art on both CVOGL and G2D datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of iterative cross-view interaction and multi-scale spatial attention in reducing edge-noise and refining cross-view relationships.

Conclusion: The proposed CVCAM and MHSAM architectures improve cross-view geo-localization by enabling deeper cross-view interaction and richer spatial feature representations, while the new G2D dataset helps address data scarcity in Ground-to-Drone localization and supports strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

### [16] [HiGS: Hierarchical Generative Scene Framework for Multi-Step Associative Semantic Spatial Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27148)
*Jiacheng Hong,Kunzhen Wu,Mingrui Yu,Yichao Gu,Shengze Xue,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical, multi-step 3D scene generator guided by user-selected key semantic objects, using a Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph to maintain target relationships and enable recursive layout optimization, achieving better layout plausibility, style consistency, and user satisfaction than single-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene generation often relies on single-step, monolithic generation, which struggles to balance scene complexity with minimal user input. The authors draw inspiration from human cognition—global-to-local reasoning, focusing on key elements, and semantic associations—to create a controllable, extensible pipeline for efficient 3D scene construction.

Method: Propose HiGS, a hierarchical generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition. Users iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic objects; the model auto-completes peripheral areas. Introduce Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) to dynamically organize spatial relationships and semantic dependencies across the evolving scene. PHiSSG maintains a one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supports recursive layout optimization, ensuring spatial and geometric consistency.

Result: Experiments show HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, demonstrating superior control and extensibility for efficient 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: HiGS offers a controllable and extensible paradigm for 3D scene construction, leveraging hierarchical, multi-step generation and semantic graphs to achieve coherent layouts while giving users fine-grained control over regions of interest.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

### [17] [AFM-Net: Advanced Fusing Hierarchical CNN Visual Priors with Global Sequence Modeling for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27155)
*Yuanhao Tang,Xuechao Zou,Zhengpei Hu,Junliang Xing,Chengkun Zhang,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net introduces an Advanced Hierarchical Fusing framework to jointly model local textures and global context in remote-sensing scene classification through a CNN branch and a Mamba branch, using a Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism and a Mixture-of-Experts classifier; achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, UC Merced with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote-sensing scene classification is challenged by complex spatial structures and multi-scale objects. CNNs capture local textures well, while Transformers capture global context, but integrating them efficiently is costly. The work aims to fuse local and global representations effectively and efficiently.

Method: AFM-Net employs two parallel pathways: a CNN branch that extracts hierarchical priors and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. A Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism progressively aggregates multi-scale features across pathways to enable dynamic cross-level interaction and contextual reconstruction. The fused features are then routed through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) classifier that dispatches features to specialized experts for fine-grained recognition.

Result: Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show AFM-Net achieving 93.72%, 95.54%, and 96.92% accuracy respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net demonstrates that combining a CNN-based hierarchical prior with an efficient global modeling path via Hierarchical Fusion and MoE routing yields strong local-global representations for remote-sensing scene classification, achieving top accuracy with improved efficiency. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

*Yanfan Zhu,Juming Xiong,Ruining Deng,Yu Wang,Yaohong Wang,Shilin Zhao,Mengmeng Yin,Yuqing Liu,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular, rule-based framework attempts to approximate Banff lesion scores using existing deep learning models. It decomposes Banff indicators into structural and inflammatory components, maps model outputs to Banff scores via heuristic rules, and evaluates against expert ground truths. Results show partial success but reveal critical failure modes (structural omissions, hallucinations, detection ambiguity) and poor interpretability of intermediate steps, underscoring limitations of current AI pipelines for Banff grading and the need for modular evaluation and a computational Banff standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of replicating Banff renal transplant biopsy grading with AI. The Banff system is semi-quantitative and prone to inter-observer variability; the study investigates whether current DL models can support a modular, rule-based approach to compute Banff scores.

Method: Decompose each Banff indicator (g, ptc, v) into structural and inflammatory components. Use existing segmentation/detection tools to generate outputs. Map those outputs to Banff scores with heuristic rules aligned to expert guidelines. Evaluate the resulting scores against expert-annotated ground truths.

Result: The approach yields partial successes but also critical failure modes, including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores align with expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations undermine interpretability. This highlights limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level Banff grading.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines are insufficient to fully replicate computational expert-level Banff grading. A modular evaluation framework and a computational Banff grading standard are important to guide future model development for transplant pathology.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

### [19] [Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164)
*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage pipeline using vision-language models, large language models, and object detectors to generate detailed, less hallucinated captions for high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images, when downscaled for standard VLMs (e.g., 224x224), lose visual detail and objects; there is a need to improve caption accuracy and reduce hallucinations for high-res images.

Method: 1) Generate initial caption using a VLM on the high-res image. 2) Use an LLM to identify key objects. 3) The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified ones. 4) Verify predicted objects with object detection systems. 5) For newly detected objects not in the initial caption, perform focused, region-specific captioning. 6) Evaluate with pairwise comparisons, LMM-based scoring, and a hallucination-detection benchmark.

Result: The approach yields captions that are more detailed and reliable, with a reduction in hallucinations, demonstrated on a curated high-resolution image dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs, LLMs, and detectors in a multi-stage pipeline effectively enhances high-resolution image captioning, producing richer and more trustworthy captions and showing promise for broader applicability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified multi-frame camera-4D radar fusion for 3D object detection (M3Detection) achieving state-of-the-art results on VoD and TJ4DRadSet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-frame camera-radar fusion and leverage richer spatiotemporal cues across frames while keeping computational costs manageable.

Method: A two-stage multi-frame fusion framework: (1) use intermediate features from a baseline detector and a tracker to get reference trajectories; (2) global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar to align features across proposals and local-level inter-grid aggregation along reference trajectories to enrich fine-grained representation; plus a trajectory-level spatiotemporal reasoning module to encode cross-frame interactions.

Result: Experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet show state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating effectiveness of multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that multi-frame camera-4D radar fusion with radar-guided global alignment and trajectory-aware local aggregation improves 3D detection and is practical for robust perception in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

*Yucheng Xing,Jinxing Yin,Xiaodong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework (DANCER) enhances single-person dance video generation by adding appearance enhancement and pose-driven rendering, leveraging a stable video diffusion model, plus a new TikTok-3K dataset; it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic dance videos is hard due to high freedom of human motion and need for temporal continuity; existing methods struggle to maintain appearance fidelity and coherent motion; combining reference appearance with pose-based motion guidance can improve results.

Method: Proposes Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to preserve reference image details and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to extend motion guidance from additional pose domains; uses stable video diffusion model as backbone; collects large-scale internet video data to form TikTok-3K dataset; integrates both inputs to guide video synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods; ablations likely show contributions of AEM and PRM; dataset and code will be released on acceptance.

Conclusion: DANCER effectively improves realistic single-person dance synthesis by fusing appearance-aware enhancement and pose-guided rendering within diffusion-based video generation; the TikTok-3K dataset supports training; results demonstrate improved quality and continuity.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

*Mingyu Sung,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache introduces a hierarchical dual-stage caching mechanism with PFS to accelerate diffusion-model inference by up to ~5x while preserving image quality, outperforming prior caching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of iterative denoising in diffusion models and the limitations of existing caching approaches that trade speed for fidelity, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: Split the denoising process into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage, apply a dual-threshold selective caching strategy for each stage, and use Pooled Feature Summarization (PFS) for fast, robust similarity estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 5.08x acceleration with image quality nearly identical to the baseline, outperforming existing caching methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, practical solution to the speed–quality dilemma in diffusion models, lowering barriers to real-world deployment; source code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

### [23] [SilhouetteTell: Practical Video Identification Leveraging Blurred Recordings of Video Subtitles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27179)
*Guanchong Huang,Song Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A subtitle-silhouette based spatiotemporal attack, SilhouetteTell, can identify online and offline videos by matching recorded subtitle silhouettes (and their timing) to the video’s subtitle file, achieving high accuracy even from up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video privacy is at risk from side-channel information beyond network traffic. Subtitles visible on screen leak content and timing cues that can uniquely identify videos and even their clips, enabling profiling or targeted attacks.

Method: Extract spatial silhouettes of on-screen subtitles and their temporal gaps; build spatiotemporal features; correlate these with the video's subtitle file (e.g., SRT) to identify titles and clips for both streaming and offline videos; validate using experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones at varying distances.

Result: Demonstrates high efficacy in inferring video titles and clips; effective for online and offline videos;成功 (up to 40 meters) across different settings, indicating practical feasibility.

Conclusion: Subtitle-based visual side channels pose a practical privacy threat for video viewing. SilhouetteTell demonstrates a feasible attack that warrants attention for defense and mitigation in video rendering or subtitle handling.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

*John Won,Kyungmin Lee,Huiwon Jang,Dongyoung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUST introduces a dual-stream diffusion transformer for world-model augmented VLA, maintaining separate modality streams with independent noise and a decoupled flow-matching loss to jointly model next-state observations and actions. It enables asynchronous test-time sampling and shows gains across simulation and real-world robotic tasks, with transfer benefits from pretraining on action-free videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the modality gap in joint next-state and action prediction for vision-language-action (VLA) models by avoiding forced unified latent spaces, while improving cross-modal knowledge sharing and enabling scalable test-time sampling.

Method: A multimodal diffusion transformer with two separate modality streams (vision and action) and independent noise perturbations for each modality, plus a decoupled flow-matching loss. Learns a bidirectional joint distribution without a unified latent space. Introduces a joint sampling method that allows asynchronous evolution of action and vision tokens at test time, and leverages pretraining on action-free videos (BridgeV2).

Result: Empirical gains of up to 6% over baselines on RoboCasa and GR-1; additional 2-5% boost from test-time scaling; 13% improvement on real-world Franka Research 3; strong transfer gains from BridgeV2 pretraining to RoboCasa.

Conclusion: DUST effectively mitigates modality conflict in world-model augmented VLAs, enhancing performance across simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks, and enabling scalable pretraining transfers. The architecture’s decoupled training and asynchronous sampling contribute to robust cross-modal learning and practical test-time adaptability.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

### [25] [Dual-level Progressive Hardness-Aware Reweighting for Cross-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27181)
*Guozheng Zheng,Jian Guan,Mingjie Xie,Xuanjia Zhao,Congyi Fan,Shiheng Zhang,Pengming Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-level progressive hardness-aware reweighting framework (DPHR) for cross-view geo-localization that improves training stability and hard-negative mining by combining sample-level ratio-based difficulty weighting with batch-level progressive loss weighting, yielding consistent gains over state-of-the-art on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVGL suffers from severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives; traditional static reweighting is sensitive to distribution shifts and tends to emphasize difficult samples too early, causing noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: DPHR introduces two components: (1) Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module for sample-level, assigning fine-grained weights to negatives based on relative difficulty; (2) Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) for batch-level, using training-progress signals to attenuate noisy gradients in early training and progressively strengthen hard-negative mining as training advances.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness of DPHR.

Conclusion: DPHR effectively mitigates premature emphasis on hard negatives and distribution shifts, delivering stable optimization and improved CVGL performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [26] [Sparse Model Inversion: Efficient Inversion of Vision Transformers for Data-Free Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27186)
*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sparse model inversion (SMI) method that accelerates dense inversion for high-resolution ViTs by focusing on semantic foregrounds and avoiding noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations, achieving up to 3.79x speedup with comparable or improved downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense inversion of large Vision Transformers is inefficient due to revisiting noisy backgrounds and hallucinated correlations; fast, data-free inversion is desirable for privacy-preserving data reconstruction and downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce a plug-and-play sparse inversion strategy that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while stopping inversion in backgrounds and suspected spurious correlations, compatible with existing dense inversion loss functions; includes theoretical and empirical validation.

Result: Speedups up to 3.79x; downstream tasks like data-free quantization and data-free knowledge transfer show comparable or improved performance.

Conclusion: Sparse, targeted inversion provides substantial computational gains without sacrificing performance and can be adopted as a lightweight extension to existing inversion pipelines; code released.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

*Caixin Kang,Yifei Huang,Liangyang Ouyang,Mingfang Zhang,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MIVA task and a Werewolf-based multimodal dataset; shows MLLMs struggle to detect deception; identifies grounding/alignment shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for AI with robust social intelligence that can ground language in visual social cues to detect truthfulness in interactive settings; current MLLMs underperform on deception detection.

Method: Define Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), build a Werewolf-derived dataset with synchronized video and text and verifiable ground-truth labels for each statement; benchmark state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and analyze failure modes.

Result: Large performance gap: even strong models like GPT-4o cannot reliably distinguish truth from falsehood; models fail to ground language in visual social cues and may be overly conservative in alignment.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for novel approaches that improve perceptual grounding of language to visual social cues and for more trustworthy, interactive multimodal AI systems; future work should address grounding, alignment, and deception-detection capabilities.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

*Jiaxin Zhang,Zehong Zhu,Junye Deng,Yunqin Li,and Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical graph neural network fusing multimodal data to analyze village spatial morphology, achieving strong classification performance across 17 subtypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urbanization erodes village spatial characteristics and homogenizes landscapes; existing studies are often single-disciplinary and data-limited, hindering robust analysis.

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network with input and communication nodes, static and dynamic edges, combining GCN and GAT in a two-stage feature update, plus a relational pooling mechanism and joint training across 17 village-subtypes.

Result: Outperforms existing multimodal fusion and classification approaches; joint optimization raises mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, with ~6% gain for parcel tasks.

Conclusion: HGNN provides a scalable framework for analyzing village spatial morphology and offers evidence for underlying generative patterns in village spatial organization.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continual self-supervised learning framework with latent replay and WKD+BKE for multi-window chest CT; preserves privacy and robustly handles domain shifts, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in chest CT arise from different window settings and data privacy constraints hinder reusing past data; scarcity of large, labeled datasets makes robust medical imaging models challenging.

Method: Continual pretraining on unlabeled chest CT images with a latent replay mechanism to mitigate forgetting during domain shifts, augmented by a feature distillation scheme combining Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE) to learn robust, domain-shift-resilient representations across window settings.

Result: Validation on chest CT data collected under two window settings shows superior performance compared with other approaches, demonstrating effective domain-shift handling and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: A privacy-preserving CSSL framework with latent replay and WKD+BKE can learn diverse, robust representations across window settings, enabling more generalizable medical image diagnosis models.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

### [30] [SpecAware: A Spectral-Content Aware Foundation Model for Unifying Multi-Sensor Learning in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27219)
*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a sensor-aware hyperspectral foundation model that unifies multi-sensor HSI learning via a two-step hypernetwork encoding, supported by Hyper-400K, achieving state-of-the-art results on LULC tasks (segmentation, change detection, scene classification).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inherent heterogeneity of HSI data across sensors and the lack of guidance from sensor meta-attributes hinder generalization in joint training; existing foundation models underutilize sensor metadata, limiting transferability.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: first, a meta-content aware module generates a unique conditional input for each HSI patch by fusing sensor meta-attributes with content for each spectral band; second, a sample-conditioned hypernetwork in the HyperEmbedding module produces a pair of channel-wise encoding matrices that enable adaptive spatial pattern extraction and latent semantic feature re-projection; together they support variable spectral channels and a unified joint pre-training framework. Also introduces Hyper-400K dataset of >400k patches from AVIRIS sensors.

Result: Six-dataset experiments show SpecAware learns superior representations and excels in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification.

Conclusion: SpecAware enables unified multi-sensor HSI learning, improving transferability across sensors; Hyper-400K provides a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11 is proposed for joint building extraction and discrete height classification on satellite imagery, achieving strong instance segmentation mAP while offering fast inference and robust performance in complex urban scenes; demonstrates potential for real-time, large-scale urban mapping on the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building segmentation and height classification are essential for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring. Existing multitask approaches face challenges with occlusion, scale variation, and class imbalance, limiting real-time large-scale mapping.

Method: Introduce YOLOv11 with enhanced multi-scale feature fusion and a multitask head for instance segmentation and discrete height classification. Evaluate on the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset (~125,000 annotated buildings across 12 cities) using metrics such as precision, recall, F1, and mAP (mAP@50 and mAP@50-95).

Result: YOLOv11 achieves 60.4% mAP@50 and 38.3% mAP@50-95 for instance segmentation, with robust height classification across five height tiers. It handles occlusions and complex shapes well, addresses class imbalance, and offers improved inference speed over earlier multitask frameworks.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential for real-time, large-scale semantic urban reconstruction with integrated height modeling, offering actionable insights for remote sensing and geospatial intelligence and motivating future improvements in scalable, single-stage multitask urban mapping.

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRE is a dense 3D visual foundation model using Mixture-of-Experts to route features to specialized task-specific experts, with a depth-refinement module and semantic-geometry fusion, achieving state-of-the-art on benchmarks with no extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D model scaling is limited by complex geometric supervision and data diversity; existing single-model architectures struggle to generalize; Mixture-of-Experts offers specialization to diverse data aspects, enabling scalable and robust 3D representation learning.

Method: MoRE employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts; includes a confidence-based depth refinement module to stabilize geometric estimates; fuses dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone features to improve surface normal prediction; uses tailored loss functions for diverse inputs and multiple geometric tasks.

Result: Empirical evaluations show state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and effective downstream applications without additional computation.

Conclusion: MoRE advances scalable, robust 3D visual foundation modeling by combining MoE-based specialization, depth refinement, and semantic-geometry fusion to deliver high-quality geometry and normal predictions across tasks with efficient inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

*Tianli Liao,Ran Wang,Siqing Zhang,Lei Li,Guangen Liu,Chenyang Zhao,Heling Cao,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, learning-based mesh-warping method (Object-IR) for image retargeting that preserves important objects and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art results with real-time performance and no need for annotated retargeting data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric distortion in retargeting harms semantically important regions; current methods struggle to preserve appearance without annotations. A self-supervised approach can leverage intrinsic geometric and semantic cues to guide warping.

Method: Initialize a uniform rigid mesh at the output resolution; a CNN predicts the motion of each mesh grid to produce a deformed mesh. Warp the input image using the two meshes. Optimize with a composite loss: object-consistent loss to preserve important objects, geometric-preserving loss to constrain simple scaling of important meshes, and boundary loss for a clean rectangular output. The supervision is derived from the input's geometric and semantic properties, avoiding manual annotations.

Result: On RetargetMe, Object-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality. It processes arbitrary input resolutions quickly (average 0.009s for 1024x683) and runs in real time on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: The self-supervised framework eliminates the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets, delivering high-quality, geometry-aware retargeting with real-time performance. Source code will be released soon.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at
https://github.com/tlliao/Object-IR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseCPath: a framework to fuse heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) for whole-slide image analysis, using multi-view patch filtering, cluster-level re-embedding, and collaborative distillation to achieve state-of-the-art results on TCGA cancer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI analysis relies on foundation models, but heterogeneity across private training data and architectures yields variable performance. A unified framework to fuse multiple FMs could harness complementary strengths and improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: (i) Patch-level filtering via multi-view clustering on embeddings from multiple FMs to select discriminative patches; (ii) cluster-level re-embedding to capture patch-level local features for effective fusion of heterogeneous patch-level FMs; (iii) collaborative distillation to exploit connections between slide-level FMs for fused slide-level representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets for lung, bladder, and colorectal cancers show FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating robust gains from fusing heterogeneous FMs.

Conclusion: FuseCPath demonstrates that integrating heterogeneous pathological FMs through filtering, re-embedding, and distillation yields superior WSI representations and improved downstream performance, validating the proposed fusion strategy.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

*Alik Pramanick,Mayank Bansal,Utkarsh Srivastava,Suklav Ghosh,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-phase defense against adversarial attacks: a denoising network that fuses spatial and frequency (via DWT) features using a transformer, followed by retraining the classifier on denoised images; shows strong robustness gains on MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting deployment in security-critical applications; existing denoising or adversarial training methods are insufficiently robust.

Method: Phase 1: train a denoising network that combines spatial image features with wavelet-based frequency information using a transformer layer (DWT for frequency analysis). Phase 2: retrain the classifier on denoised images to improve robustness, evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST.

Result: The method significantly improves classification accuracy, outperforming approaches that rely solely on a denoising network or adversarial training; code is provided (GitHub).

Conclusion: Joint spatial-frequency denoising and two-phase training bolster robustness of image classifiers against adversarial attacks across multiple datasets, leveraging DWT and transformer fusion to mitigate high-frequency corruption.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a contrastive learning-based defense against adversarial attacks by training on clean and adversarial images with a contrastive loss, jointly optimizing network parameters and perturbations to learn robust representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks cause misclassifications with small perturbations; a robust defense is essential for safe deployment of deep learning. Contrastive learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for enhancing robustness.

Method: Apply a contrastive loss using pairs from clean and adversarially perturbed images, training the model parameters and perturbations jointly so the learned representations are robust to perturbations.

Result: Experiments indicate significant improvements in robustness against various adversarial perturbations, suggesting the learned representations are more informative and resilient.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning can be an effective direction for adversarial robustness, contributing to the broader field by yielding robust feature representations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

### [37] [Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Zero-shot Action Recognition with Language-driven Description Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27255)
*Yehna Kim andYoung-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose using web-crawled descriptions with a large-language model to extract keywords, plus a spatio-temporal interaction module, to improve zero-shot video action recognition, achieving strong results on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action understanding suffers from semantic ambiguity due to multi-semantic words in action classes; scalable, annotation-free semantic context is needed beyond class labels.

Method:  Leverage web descriptions and an LLM to distill relevant keywords; introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module that emphasizes objects and action units; align description attributes with video content for zero-shot recognition.

Result: Zero-shot accuracies of 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600, demonstrating robustness across datasets.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual attribute annotation and demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness of combining web-derived semantic attributes with a spatio-temporal alignment module for video understanding across downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

*Yinglu Li,Zhiying Lu,Zhihang Liu,Chuanbin Liu,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts multimodal retrieval from document-level to region-level, using hybrid supervision and dynamic region grouping to reduce irrelevant visual content and boost retrieval and QA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document-level retrieval in multimodal RAG often includes large irrelevant regions and, when using multiple documents, adds redundant content, diluting salient information and hurting model performance.

Method: During training, apply hybrid supervision from labeled and unlabeled data to locate relevant patches. At inference, use a dynamic pipeline to group salient patches into complete semantic regions. The retriever identifies relevant regions while the generator focuses on concise visual content.

Result: RegionRAG achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, with an average R@1 improvement of 10.02 percentage points and an average QA accuracy increase of 3.56 percentage points, while using only 71.42% of visual tokens compared to prior methods. Code will be released at the provided link.

Conclusion: Shifting from document-level to region-level retrieval enables the retriever to filter for relevant content, improving efficiency and accuracy of multimodal RAG.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/Aeryn666/RegionRAG.

### [39] [T3: Test-Time Model Merging in VLMs for Zero-Shot Medical Imaging Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27265)
*Raza Imam,Hu Wang,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic, backprop-free per-sample (and batch) merging of pretrained and fine-tuned medical MVLMs using Jensen-Shannon divergence to handle modality shifts, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained models offer robustness but miss modality-specific cues; fine-tuned experts excel in-distribution but degrade under modality shift. Existing merging methods are static and unreliable across diverse medical modalities.

Method: Introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3) that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions; extend to batch-level T^3_B to reduce inference cost; propose a cross-modal medical merging benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol.

Result: T^3 achieves new state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy and reduced error across four medical modalities, outperforming strong baselines while remaining efficient; T^3_B substantially reduces computation due to batch-coefficient merging.

Conclusion: Enables adaptive, reliable model merging for clinical MVLM deployment; sets a scalable framework for modality-robust merging and provides code at the cited GitHub repo.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Razaimam45/TCube.

### [40] [HyperClick: Advancing Reliable GUI Grounding via Uncertainty Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27266)
*Shaojie Zhang,Pei Fu,Ruoceng Zhang,Jiahui Yang,Anan Du,Xiuwen Xi,Shaokang Wang,Ying Huang,Bin Qin,Zhenbo Luo,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperClick improves GUI grounding by calibrating model confidence and introducing a dual reward mechanism (binary action reward + truncated Gaussian spatial confidence), optimized with Brier score, to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and well-calibrated reliability in GUI automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding models often overestimate their capabilities, leading to overconfident and unreliable predictions, especially in dynamic GUI automation where small errors can derail tasks.

Method: Introduce HyperClick, a dual-reward framework that combines a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence model calibrated via the Brier score; jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability to foster introspective self-criticism.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show state-of-the-art grounding performance and well-calibrated confidence, with reduced overconfidence and more reliable GUI automation.

Conclusion: Explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism in HyperClick improve reliability in GUI grounding, enabling safer and more dependable GUI automation in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

### [41] [FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280)
*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS introduces a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selector for long videos in multimodal LLMs, using a combinatorial pure-exploration bandit to pick informative frames under a token budget, achieving significant accuracy gains while using under 2% of frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos inflate token budgets in multimodal LLMs and existing keyframe methods either rely on pre-filtering or subsampling, risking missing informative moments; there is a need for scalable, principled keyframe selection.

Method: Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection (FOCUS) treats short temporal clips as arms in a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) bandit. It uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radii to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas, followed by a two-stage exploration-exploitation: first locate high-value regions, then pick top-scoring frames within each region. Training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: On two long-video QA benchmarks, FOCUS achieves substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames; for videos longer than 20 minutes, it attains an 11.9% gain on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a simple, general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs by effectively selecting keyframes under tight token budgets without additional training or model-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [42] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE uses semantics-guided adversarial sampling to improve concept erasure in diffusion models, achieving better erasure, preserving non-target concepts, and faster training than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-model concept erasure relies on adversarial training but neglects the semantic structure of concept spaces, leading to incomplete coverage of target concepts or collateral disruption of non-target concepts. A semantics-aware approach is needed to guide adversarial samples and erasure.

Method: Introduce S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which uses semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial prompts and perform erasure training, aligning adversarial samples with target concept semantics while mitigating interference with other concepts.

Result: Empirical evaluation across seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt-generation strategies in various diffusion-model unlearning scenarios shows S-GRACE improves erasure performance by about 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by ~90%. Code is available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: A semantics-guided approach to adversarial concept erasure yields more effective and efficient diffusion-model unlearning, reducing sensitive content risk with less collateral damage and compatible with existing unlearning frameworks.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

*Wenfeng Huang,Xiangyun Liao,Wei Cao,Wenjing Jia,Weixin Si*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGMamba is a lightweight, frequency-aware gated state-space model for medical image super-resolution that unifies global dependency modeling with fine-detail enhancement. It combines a GASM (gated attention-enhanced state-space module) and a PFFM (pyramid frequency fusion) to capture long-range structure and high-frequency details across multiple resolutions, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM with under 0.75M parameters across five modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image SR must balance modeling long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details while staying computationally efficient. Existing CNN/Transformer approaches often require many parameters and heavy computation, limiting clinical deployment. A frequency-aware, light-weight architecture could improve diagnostic quality and reduce acquisition costs across diverse imaging modalities.

Method: Introduce FGMamba, a frequency-aware gated state-space model. Key components: (1) GASM: integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial and channel attention to capture global dependencies while focusing on important features; (2) PFFM: pyramid-frequency fusion using FFT-guided fusion to aggregate high-frequency details across multiple resolutions. The model is compact (<0.75M parameters) and evaluated on Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic images.

Result: FGMamba achieves superior PSNR/SSIM compared with both CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (<0.75M). The results across five modalities validate the effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware state-space modeling with GASM and PFFM provides an effective, lightweight solution for medical image SR, balancing global structure and fine details across diverse modalities, enabling high-quality enhancement with very few parameters.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three-stage CASR-Net for coronary artery segmentation using multichannel preprocessing and a UNet-based architecture with a DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, achieving IoU 61.43%, DSC 76.10%, clDice 79.36% on 5-fold CV across two public datasets; shows gains over individual preprocessing steps and outperforms several SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of CAD is crucial for reducing mortality and guiding treatment; angiographic X-ray image quality can be poor, hindering accurate diagnosis, thus robust automated segmentation is valuable.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) image preprocessing with a multichannel strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham method; (2) segmentation network based on UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-Organized ONN decoder to maintain continuity of narrow and stenotic vessels; (3) contour refinement to suppress false positives; evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on two public datasets containing healthy and stenotic arteries.

Result: The model achieved IoU 61.43%, DSC 76.10%, and clDice 79.36%. Multichannel preprocessing yielded DSC gains of 0.31–0.89% and IoU gains of 0.40–1.16% over using the preprocessing techniques individually; CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust automated approach to coronary artery segmentation, supporting clinical diagnosis and treatment planning by preserving vessel continuity and reducing false positives, demonstrated by cross-validated results on public datasets.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

### [45] [Overcoming Prompts Pool Confusion via Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316)
*Zijia An,Boyu Diao,Ruiqi Liu,Libo Huang,Chuanguang Yang,Fei Wang,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P^2IOD introduces Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection, using neural networks as adaptive prompts with a fusion mechanism to consolidate knowledge across tasks and mitigate forgetting in scenarios with co-occurring objects. It achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for incremental object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In incremental object detection (IOD), objects from previous tasks may appear in current images (co-occurrence), causing confusion. Existing prompt-pool methods assume disjoint class sets and fail to account for cross-task co-occurrences, leading to prompts that forget or misrepresent past knowledge. A need exists for prompt structures that adapt across tasks while limiting updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Method: P^2IOD proposes using neural networks as parameterized prompts that evolve globally to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. It includes a prompts fusion strategy to constrain updates, thereby maintaining stable representations and reducing forgetting. The approach leverages the properties of neural network evolution to facilitate knowledge transfer and adaptation in incremental object detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO demonstrate that P^2IOD effectively handles incremental object detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.

Conclusion: Parameterized prompts with adaptive consolidation and constrained fusion offer a robust solution for IOD, effectively addressing co-occurrence challenges and surpassing prior prompt-based baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

*Wenfeng Huang,Xiangyun Liao,Yinling Qian,Hao Liu,Yongming Yang,Wenjing Jia,Qiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGS: a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework for deformable endoscopic scene reconstruction that uses a 4D deformation decoder with 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters to reduce aliasing, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS on EndoNeRF and SCARED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing dynamic, deformable tissues in endoscopy is plagued by motion-induced aliasing and artifacts; while 3D Gaussian Splatting improves efficiency, it often overlooks artifact mitigation, hindering visualization in robot-assisted surgery.

Method: Proposes SAGS, featuring an attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder and integration of 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to suppress artifacts and capture fine tissue motion; relies on Gaussian splatting for 4D dynamic scenes.

Result: Empirical evaluation on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks shows superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with improved visualization.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses aliasing in deformable endoscopic reconstructions, delivering higher fidelity reconstructions and better visualization, demonstrating robustness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

*Weiming Chen,Yijia Wang,Zhihan Zhu,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ultra-low bitrate visual communication by jointly encoding semantic text and a coding latent to guide a rectified flow-based generator, enabling precise visual reconstruction for vision tasks at very low bitrates with performance comparable to higher-rate methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for reliable remote vision analysis and human interaction under extreme bandwidth constraints in challenging environments (space, warfare, robotics). Existing text-to-image or compression approaches either lack scene-level fidelity or are not tuned for vision-task accuracy.

Method: Encode both semantic text and a coding latent at a very small bitrate and transmit to a decoder. Use rectified flow models guided by the text and latent to generate the visual scene, integrating image generation with deep image compression.

Result: Experimental results claim comparable image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy to existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth; code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective ultra-low bitrate visual communication for remote vision analysis and human interactions, with potential for deployment in bandwidth-constrained scenarios and for advancing joint semantics-compression methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: A comprehensive write-up of the MeisenMeister approach for the ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025, focusing on a robust, classification-based pipeline to improve early breast cancer detection in MRI, despite limited segmentation labels, with an iterative development process and a public code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for improved early breast cancer detection through efficient interpretation of breast MRI scans, while tackling the scarcity of high-quality segmentation labels that hinder segmentation-based methods, underscoring the importance for large-scale screening.

Method: Outline underlying concept and foundational assumptions, describe an iterative development process (experimentation, evaluation, refinement), and present the rationale behind design choices emphasizing performance, robustness, and clinical relevance. Public implementation is released at GitHub (MeisenMeister).

Result: The abstract emphasizes a design and reasoning process rather than providing quantitative results. It highlights expected improvements in performance, robustness, and clinical relevance but does not report specific metrics or outcomes.

Conclusion: The work aims to deliver a robust, scalable classification-based solution for breast MRI screening, with a publicly available implementation to facilitate reproducibility and adoption in clinical settings.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited
availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust
classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast
cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening.
In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the
challenge. We begin by detailing the underlying concept and foundational
assumptions that guided our work. We then describe the iterative development

### [49] [Understanding the Implicit User Intention via Reasoning with Large Language Model for Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27335)
*Yijia Wang,Yiqing Shen,Weiming Chen,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIELR reframes complex editing instructions into a sequence of explicit editing actions by leveraging LLM reasoning and iterative, foundation-model-based scene representation, avoiding joint LLM/DM fine-tuning while boosting PSNR and fidelity on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and training complexity of existing methods that require joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models for complex edits; address data scarcity for reasoning-based editing; improve preservation of untouched regions.

Method: Build a structured semantic representation of the input image with foundation models; employ an iterative update mechanism to refine the representation to a fine-grained visual scene; convert complex instructions into simple explicit edits; apply edits without joint fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms SOTA by 9.955 dB PSNR on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set; also outperforms on the proposed CIEBench benchmark with 86 samples; code and data released at the linked GitHub repo.

Conclusion: CIELR demonstrates that complex image editing can be achieved through reasoning-driven action decomposition and iterative semantic refinement, achieving high fidelity without costly joint fine-tuning; introduces a new benchmark for reasoning-based editing.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset
are available at

### [50] [RzenEmbed: Towards Comprehensive Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27350)
*Weijian Jian,Yajun Zhang,Dawei Liang,Chunyu Xie,Yixiao He,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RzenEmbed is a unified cross-modal embedding framework for text, images, videos, and visual documents that uses a two-stage training strategy and an improved InfoNCE loss (hardness weighting and false-negative mitigation) to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval on MMEB, including video and visual document tasks; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in current CLIP-like methods which mostly handle natural images; there is a need for robust cross-modal embeddings that cover videos and visual documents, with improved robustness to data noise and better instruction-following.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage 1 focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. Stage 2 introduces an enhanced InfoNCE loss with hardness-weighted sampling and strategies to mitigate false negatives. Additional enhancements include a learnable temperature parameter and model soups. The approach is evaluated on MMEB and released publicly.

Result: RzenEmbed achieves new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark, with the best overall score and superior performance on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks compared to prior work.

Conclusion: A unified, discriminative embedding framework across text, images, video, and visual documents, leveraging targeted loss and training enhancements to improve retrieval and instruction-following capabilities, with open-source release.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available
in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.

### [51] [FPS: Feedforward-based Parameter Selection For Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27359)
*Kenneth Yang,Wen-Li Wei,Jen-Chun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS is a gradient-free, feedforward parameter selection method for PEFT that identifies an optimal parameter subset in a single forward pass, achieving memory efficiency and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between addition-based adapters (latency/engineering) and selection-based GPS (full backward pass and high memory); provide a gradient-free, memory-efficient alternative for fine-tuning large pre-trained models.

Method: Compute for each parameter the product of its magnitude and the corresponding input activation; rank parameters by this product and select a subset; perform selection in a single forward pass, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and downstream data.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art performance on 24 FGVC/VTAB-1k tasks; reduces peak memory usage by ~9x; speeds up parameter selection by ~2x.

Conclusion: FPS offers a practical, memory-efficient PEFT approach that avoids backpropagation while preserving competitive performance, streamlining fine-tuning of large models.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

*Meftun Akarsu,Kerem Catay,Sedat Bin Vedat,Enes Kutay Yarkan,Ilke Senturk,Arda Sar,Dafne Eksioglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage fine-tuning pipeline using LoRA on Wan2.1 I2V-14B to synthesize cinematic scenes from small datasets; stage 1 adapts visuals with LoRA; stage 2 generates consistent keyframes and 720p video; shows improved cinematic fidelity and temporal stability; pipeline released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient, accessible domain transfer for film/TV production using open-source video diffusion models and small datasets, while preserving stylistic continuity and motion.

Method: Stage 1: integrate LoRA into cross-attention of Wan2.1 I2V-14B; train on Ay Yapim's El Turco clips to adapt visuals. Stage 2: use the fine-tuned model to produce stylized keyframes; temporally expand via video decoder to 720p; apply parallelization and sequence partitioning to speed inference; evaluate with FVD, CLIP-SIM, LPIPS; user study; release pipeline.

Result: Demonstrates measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model; enables domain transfer within hours on a single GPU; produces 720p sequences and retains costume, lighting, color grading; pipeline is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The decoupled two-stage approach makes fine-tuning open-source video diffusion models practical for cinematic production across domains, balancing efficient adaptation with temporal coherence and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

### [53] [Modality Alignment across Trees on Heterogeneous Hyperbolic Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27391)
*Wu Wei,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Pengxiang Li,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Align hierarchical features across image and text using a tree-structured representation and hyperbolic space alignment (Alignment across Trees), yielding strong gains on taxonomic open-set, few-shot, and cross-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models align images with a single global feature while texts are represented hierarchically, causing asymmetric and suboptimal cross-modal alignment. A principled method to build and align hierarchical (tree-like) features across modalities is needed.

Method: 1) Build semantic-aware visual features by applying cross-attention to image class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to obtain coarse-to-fine semantics. 2) Construct feature trees for both modalities and embed them into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to model hierarchy. 3) Align the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds using a KL-distance between distributions; learn an intermediate manifold by distance minimization. 4) Prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.

Result: Empirical evaluation on taxonomic open-set classification across multiple image datasets shows consistent performance gains over strong baselines, especially in few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The Alignment across Trees framework provides a principled, provably well-posed approach to cross-modal hierarchical alignment, leveraging hyperbolic geometry to capture hierarchies and achieving robust improvements across diverse datasets and settings.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

### [54] [A Hybrid Deep Learning and Forensic Approach for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27392)
*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deepfake detector that fuses forensic cues (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency-domain features) with CNN/ViT representations, achieving state-of-the-art results with robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid rise of realistic synthetic media produced by GANs and diffusion models has increased misinformation risk; traditional deep-learning detectors struggle with generalization and robustness, while forensic methods offer interpretability but limited adaptability. A hybrid approach aims to combine strengths of both.

Method: Integrates forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in a fusion framework. Includes explainability tools (Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps) showing overlap with manipulated regions. Evaluated on benchmark datasets FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, and DFDC; robustness tests include compression, adversarial perturbations, and unseen manipulations.

Result: The method outperforms single-method baselines and existing hybrid approaches. Reported F1 scores: 0.96 (FaceForensics++), 0.82 (Celeb-DF v2), 0.77 (DFDC). Robustness: F1 = 0.87 at JPEG quality factor 50; AUC = 0.84 under adversarial perturbations; F1 = 0.79 for unseen manipulations. Explainability: Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps overlapped ground-truth manipulated regions in 82% of cases.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches that fuse forensic cues with deep representations provide a balanced solution—high accuracy, robustness, and transparency—leading to more resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

### [55] [Who Does Your Algorithm Fail? Investigating Age and Ethnic Bias in the MAMA-MIA Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27421)
*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fairness audit of automated breast tumor segmentation (MAMA-MIA) finds an age-related bias against younger patients and data-source–dependent ethnic biases, highlighting the need for granular, multi-source evaluation in segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend fairness assessment beyond image-level classification to segmentation tasks in medical imaging, ensuring automated segmentation does not propagate disparities in care across age, ethnicity, or data provenance.

Method: Audit automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer dataset by evaluating segmentation quality across age groups, ethnicities, and data sources, and control for confounders (e.g., data source) to assess intrinsic biases.

Result: Intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients persists after confounder control; multi-source data aggregation influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: Segmentation fairness requires granular, multi-source data analysis and consideration of physiological factors, as biases can emerge and amplify across clinical decision points and dataset integration.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [56] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to prevent semantic collapse in PRVR by preserving text correlations, disentangling and aligning multi-scale video representations, and using token merging for coherent yet distinct video segments, achieving stronger PRVR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR requires retrieving videos where only part of the content matches a text query. Existing methods collapse semantic variation by treating all annotated pairs as positives and ignoring intra- and inter-video semantic diversity, limiting retrieval when videos contain multiple events.

Method: 1) Text Correlation Preservation Learning to retain semantic relationships encoded by foundation models for text queries. 2) Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. 3) order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to produce internally coherent yet mutually distinctive video segments and improve alignment.

Result: Extensive PRVR benchmark experiments show the framework prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates semantic collapse in both text and video embeddings and yields improved PRVR retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

### [57] [DeblurSDI: Blind Image Deblurring Using Self-diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27439)
*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised blind image deconvolution framework based on reverse self-diffusion that jointly optimizes two networks to estimate sharp image and blur kernel without pre-training; with a noise scheduling strategy, it achieves robust, instance-specific priors and superior results on heavily degraded images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ill-posed blind deconvolution while reducing reliance on handcrafted priors and large external training data, enabling better adaptation to real-world degradations.

Method: Formulate blind deconvolution as an iterative reverse self-diffusion process starting from pure noise. At each step, optimize two randomly-initialized networks to estimate the sharp image and the blur kernel, guided by data consistency and an L1 sparsity prior on the kernel. A noise scheduling mechanism stabilizes optimization and grants robustness to kernel size, yielding an instance-specific prior.

Result: Empirical results show DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels under highly degraded conditions.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides a practical zero-shot framework for blind deconvolution that learns an instance-specific prior on the input and is robust to kernel variations, reducing dependence on external training data.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

TL;DR: CoMViT is a compact Vision Transformer tailored for resource-constrained medical imaging, achieving ~4.5M params and 5-20x parameter reduction while matching or surpassing deeper CNN/ViT models across 12 MedMNIST datasets; uses convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based aggregation; supported by Grad-CAM interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel but are computationally heavy and prone to overfitting on small medical datasets; there is a need for an efficient, generalizable ViT design that preserves accuracy and interpretability in low-resource clinical settings.

Method: Proposes CoMViT: a compact ViT architecture with (i) convolutional tokenizer to embed local features, (ii) diagonal masking to reduce attention complexity, (iii) dynamic temperature scaling to stabilize training, (iv) pooling-based sequence aggregation to reduce token count, plus systematic architectural optimization tested on twelve MedMNIST datasets; ~4.5M parameters.

Result: Outperforms or matches deeper CNNs and ViTs across 12 datasets; achieves 5-20x parameter reduction with little or no accuracy loss; qualitative Grad-CAM shows attention to clinically relevant regions; robust generalization in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Principled ViT redesign enables efficient, interpretable medical imaging models suitable for low-resource clinical deployment; CoMViT demonstrates that compact, well-regularized architectures can retain performance while significantly reducing parameters.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

*Jianwen Sun,Fanrui Zhang,Yukang Feng,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Yifan Chang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a modular, multi-agent framework for editable, vector-based scientific illustrations, paired with VisBench for seven-dimensional evaluation; it enables element-level control via roles (Manager, Designer, Toolbox) and evaluates LMs; ablations confirm architecture and quantify role/step/description effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of raster-only generative models and cumbersome code-based generation by providing a practical, editable, element-level, vector-based illustration pipeline.

Method: Introduce VisPainter with three specialized modules using model context protocol; ensure diagrams are compatible with standard vector graphics; construct VisBench with seven metrics across content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost; perform ablations and evaluate various vision-language models; quantify impact of role division, step control, and description.

Result: Produces editable, element-level diagrams compatible with vector software; VisBench provides a multi-dimensional evaluation; ablations validate architecture and evaluation; fair model rankings and quantified effects of design choices.

Conclusion: VisPainter and VisBench form a practical framework for efficient, editable scientific illustration with modular collaboration; enables true element-level manipulation; sets up future improvements in model alignment and interactive design workflows.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

*Casper Fibaek,Abi Riley,Kelsey Doerksen,Do-Hyung Kim,Rochelle Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-tiered, human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping improves accuracy/completeness of educational facility records in data-poor regions; a tiered approach scales from ML gap detection to VHR imagery, with a human review interface; the medium-resolution tier was removed due to limited gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In developing regions, school facility data are scarce and outdated, hampering planning and resource allocation; an accurate, scalable mapping framework is needed to support educational planning.

Method: Tier 1: ML analysis comparing population density, land cover, and existing infrastructure with known school locations to identify gaps and mislabeled schools. Tier 2: Sentinel-2 medium-resolution imagery to locate high-likelihood school regions (later removed due to insignificant improvements). Tier 3: Very high-resolution imagery and deep learning to generate detailed candidate school locations in prioritized areas. All models build on global pre-trained steps to improve generalisation, and an interactive human-in-the-loop interface enables review, validation, and refinement.

Result: Preliminary evaluations indicate the approach is scalable and cost-effective for educational infrastructure mapping and planning; the medium-resolution tier was removed due to limited gains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, interactive solution for accurate school mapping in resource-constrained settings, aiding planning and resource allocation; future work should address generalisation, data quality, and integration into decision-making processes.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

*Hyemin Boo,Eunsang Lee,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reference-aware audiovisual deepfake detector (Referee) uses one-shot speaker cues to detect forgeries beyond spatiotemporal artifacts by aligning identity cues across reference and target clips, achieving state-of-the-art generalization across datasets and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often fail to generalize to unseen manipulations that do not exhibit explicit artifacts. Incorporating cross-modal identity verification via a reference (one-shot) speaker example aims to detect manipulations that break audiovisual identity consistency.

Method: Referee matches identity-related queries from a one-shot reference to the target content and builds cross-modal features that jointly reason about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency, enabling detection beyond surface artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF show state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols, highlighting the importance of cross-modal identity verification in deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Cross-modal, reference-guided verification improves generalization to unseen forgeries, suggesting a promising direction for robust deepfake detection; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

### [62] [NAUTILUS: A Large Multimodal Model for Underwater Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27481)
*Wei Xu,Cheng Wang,Dingkang Liang,Zongchuang Zhao,Xingyu Jiang,Peng Zhang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NautData, a large-scale 1.45M image-text dataset for eight underwater scene understanding tasks, and NAUTILUS, an underwater vision-language model built by integrating a plug-and-play Vision Feature Enhancement (VFE) module into LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL. The VFE, grounded in underwater imaging physics, boosts robustness to degradation and improves performance across tasks on NautData and public datasets; data and models released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scene understanding requires multi-task perception at multiple granularities but lacks large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning datasets. Image quality degradation underwater further impedes progress, necessitating robust datasets and methods that can leverage physical priors for restoration-based improvements.

Method: Create NautData with 1.45M image-text pairs supporting eight underwater tasks. Develop a plug-and-play Vision Feature Enhancement (VFE) module based on physical priors from underwater imaging models to restore clear information. Integrate VFE into existing baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL to form NAUTILUS, an underwater LMM. Evaluate on NautData and public underwater datasets.

Result: The VFE module consistently improves baseline models on the majority of the supported tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of NAUTILUS for underwater scene understanding. Data and models are released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The approach advances underwater scene understanding by providing a large-scale, task-aligned dataset and a physics-informed augmentation module that enhances model robustness to underwater degradation, culminating in a superior underwater LMM (NAUTILUS).

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data
and models are available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/NAUTILUS.

*Jiawei Gu,Yunzhuo Hao,Huichen Will Wang,Linjie Li,Michael Qizhe Shieh,Yejin Choi,Ranjay Krishna,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified multimodal reasoning model that interleaves progressive text and image steps, trained on 24k interleaved traces; it achieves large gains on vision tasks, generalizes to new domains, and exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions what a meaningful interleaved chain-of-thought looks like in multimodal reasoning. It argues that text and image thoughts should be complementary, not isomorphic, and seeks to build a model that jointly refines both modalities to advance reasoning.

Method: Fine-tune a unified model on 24k high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement. Train it to generate progressive text–image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic.

Result: ThinkMorph delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks (average 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. It also shows emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and improved test-time scalability via diversified multimodal thoughts.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates emergent multimodal intelligence in a unified model and offers a promising direction for characterizing and developing unified multimodal reasoning systems that integrate language and vision in a complementary, progressive manner.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

treatment planning, and effectively combining anatomical and functional
information from PET and CT remains a major challenge. In this study, we
propose vMambaX, a lightweight multimodal framework integrating PET and CT scan

feature interaction, emphasizing informative regions while suppressing noise.
Evaluated on the PCLT20K dataset, the model outperforms baseline models while
maintaining lower computational complexity. These results highlight the
effectiveness of adaptive cross-modal gating for multimodal tumor segmentation

### [65] [Deep Neural Watermarking for Robust Copyright Protection in 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27533)
*Khandoker Ashik Uz Zaman,Mohammad Zahangir Alam,Mohammed N. M. Ali,Mahdi H. Miraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning–assisted watermarking approach for 3D point clouds that embeds watermarks in SVD components and uses PointNet++ for robust extraction under severe attacks, outperforming SVD baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are increasingly used and require copyright protection. Traditional watermarking struggles under geometric/non-geometric attacks; deep learning-based extraction can improve robustness and ownership verification.

Method: Embed binary watermark into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks via SVD; train a PointNet++ network to reliably extract the watermark after attacks (rotation, scaling, noise, cropping, distortions); evaluate on ModelNet40 and compare to SVD-based methods.

Result: Deep learning-based extraction achieves bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and IoU 0.80 under Crop (70%) attack, outperforming SVD-based extraction (0.58 bitwise accuracy, IoU 0.26).

Conclusion: The proposed DL-based watermarking framework provides superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity under severe distortions, enhancing 3D copyright protection and ownership verification.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

### [66] [MapSAM2: Adapting SAM2 for Automatic Segmentation of Historical Map Images and Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27547)
*Xue Xia,Randall Balestriero,Tao Zhang,Yixin Zhou,Andrew Ding,Dev Saini,Lorenz Hurni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a unified, few-shot, video-based segmentation framework for historical maps and their time-series, enabling temporal linking of features with pseudo-video data and minimal annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps vary stylistically and lack annotations; linking maps across time to study building dating, networks, and environmental change requires automated, scalable solutions.

Method: Treat images and time series as videos. For images, process tiles as a video using memory attention to leverage context from similar tiles; for time series, create annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and generate pseudo time series from single-year maps via simulated temporal transformations; fine-tune a visual foundation model with few-shot learning.

Result: MapSAM2 learns temporal associations and can segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos; shows improved geometric accuracy for areal features due to memory-attention context.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 provides a practical framework for automatic segmentation of historical maps and their time series, with released dataset and code to foster future research.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

### [67] [Towards Universal Video Retrieval: Generalizing Video Embedding via Synthesized Multimodal Pyramid Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27571)
*Zhuoning Guo,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval: a 16-dataset UVRB benchmark, a data synthesis pipeline generating 1.55M pairs, and the Modality Pyramid curriculum to train a General Video Embedder (GVE); claims state-of-the-art zero-shot results and highlights inadequacies of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval benchmarks drive narrow, single-task capabilities, hindering multi-domain generalization; a diagnostic, multifaceted evaluation is needed to guide universal video retrieval.

Method: 1) UVRB: a 16-dataset benchmark to diagnose capability gaps across tasks/domains; 2) scalable data synthesis generating 1.55M high-quality pairs to cover required semantic space; 3) Modality Pyramid curriculum to train a General Video Embedder by exploiting latent data interconnections.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB; analyses show popular benchmarks poorly predict general ability; partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: A co-designed framework integrating evaluation, data, and modeling can drive toward universal video retrieval and reveal the limitations of conventional benchmarks; the proposed pipeline offers a practical path to broader generalization.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

### [68] [Image Hashing via Cross-View Code Alignment in the Age of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27584)
*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple, unified hashing framework for cross-view alignment of binary codes, enabling efficient large-scale retrieval with 16-bit codes. It uses a single cross-entropy loss for view alignment and a coding-rate regularizer to prevent collapse, implemented via a lightweight HashCoder MLP with batch normalization. It can probe frozen embeddings or be LoRA-tuned, achieves state-of-the-art results in few epochs, with unsupervised COCO hashing under 2 minutes and supervised ImageNet-100 hashing in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires compact, discriminative representations. Foundation-model embeddings are powerful but high-dimensional; nearest-neighbor search is costly. Hashing offers fast approximate search, but existing methods are complex or slow. A simple, unified, fast hashing objective is desirable across learning paradigms.

Method: Propose CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment): train with a single binary cross-entropy loss to align semantically matched views; use a coding-rate maximization term as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and diverse binary codes. Implement HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced codes. HashCoder can act as a probing head on frozen embeddings or be adapted to encoders via LoRA fine-tuning. Train across benchmarks for just 5 epochs.

Result: CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. At 16 bits, it excels in efficiency: unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes; supervised hashing on ImageNet-100 completes in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

Conclusion: CroVCA offers an efficient, adaptable, and broadly applicable hashing solution for large-scale retrieval. Its simple, unified objective and lightweight architecture enable rapid training and deployment across different learning paradigms and datasets while delivering strong retrieval performance.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [69] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR combines adversarial training with supervised contrastive learning and hard-positive mining to learn robust, well-structured representations. It aligns embeddings of images, their augmentations, and adversarial perturbations so that same-class samples cluster together while different classes separate, improving both clean and robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 under PGD-20 than standard adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradients used to learn can be exploited by adversarial perturbations, revealing a vulnerability where small changes cause misclassification. A robust representation should be stable to perturbations and rely on meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues.

Method: Integrates adversarial guidance with hard-mined supervised contrastive learning. The model trains to bring together embeddings of an image, its augmentations, and its adversarial perturbations within the same class, while pushing apart embeddings from different classes. Uses a hard-positive mining strategy within a supervised contrastive objective, under adversarial perturbations, to learn robust representations.

Result: On CIFAR-10, ANCHOR achieves strong clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 attack (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision yields more structured, robust representations and narrows the accuracy-robustness gap compared to traditional adversarial training.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRIDA introduces a lightweight forensic framework that uses internal diffusion-model activations for fake-image detection and source attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier on diffusion features enables strong cross-generator detection without fine-tuning, while a compact neural model performs accurate source attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of generative diffusion models makes synthetic images increasingly hard to distinguish from real ones, raising authenticity, copyright, and misinformation concerns. Supervised detectors struggle to generalize to unseen generators and require large labeled datasets and retraining.

Method: Leverages internal activations from a pre-trained diffusion model. Applies a k-nearest-neighbor classifier to diffusion features for cross-generator fake-image detection without fine-tuning. Develops a compact neural model for source generator attribution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator detection performance without any fine-tuning and provides accurate source attribution. Demonstrates that diffusion representations encode generator-specific patterns, enabling a simple, interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based representations offer a lightweight, interpretable approach for detecting and attributing synthetic images across generators, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and retraining while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised RL signals from standard RGB/RGB-D images enable Spatial-SSRL to train LVLMs on five pretext tasks that capture 2D/3D spatial structure, yielding improved spatial understanding without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial understanding is a key weakness in LVLMs, and existing fine-tuning or RL-based supervision relies on costly annotations or restricted settings. A scalable self-supervised approach is desirable.

Method: Define five pretext tasks: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks provide verifiable ground-truth, require no human/LVLM annotations, and train via RLVR to improve spatial reasoning while preserving general visuals.

Result: On seven spatial benchmarks in image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines, demonstrating effective, scalable improvements in spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: Intrinsic, self-supervised supervision can support RLVR at scale and yield stronger spatial understanding in LVLMs without extra labeled data.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sketch-to-layout: a multimodal transformer uses user sketches as intuitive constraints to generate graphic layouts, with synthetic sketch generation to overcome data scarcity; evaluated on PubLayNet, DocLayNet, SlidesVQA; outperforms constraint-based methods; public release of ~200k synthetic sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users find constraint-based layout guidance complex; intuitive sketch constraints can simplify interaction and broaden accessibility. The sketch-to-layout problem remains under-explored and promising for improving design workflows.

Method: A multimodal transformer that takes a user-provided sketch and content assets as inputs to generate high-quality layouts. To address data scarcity, the authors synthesize training sketches at scale. Training and evaluation are conducted on PubLayNet, DocLayNet, and SlidesVQA, comparing against state-of-the-art constraint-based methods.

Result: The approach outperforms constraint-based baselines, offering a more intuitive design experience. A large synthetic-sketch dataset (~200k sketches) is released to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is a promising research direction that can democratize layout design. The release of synthetic sketches and public datasets will enable further exploration and benchmarking in this area.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

### [73] [VessShape: Few-shot 2D blood vessel segmentation by leveraging shape priors from synthetic images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27646)
*Cesar H. Comin,Wesley N. Galvão*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pre-training with a shape-biased synthetic dataset (VessShape) improves blood vessel segmentation, enabling strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often learn texture features and struggle with domain shifts; there is limited annotated data for vessel segmentation. Incorporating geometric priors of vessels (tubular, branching) could improve data efficiency and generalization.

Method: Create VessShape: a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset of procedurally generated tubular vessel geometries with diverse textures for foreground/background. Train a segmentation model on this data to instill a shape bias. Evaluate on real-world datasets: perform few-shot fine-tuning with 4–10 samples, and test zero-shot performance on unseen domains without target training.

Result: Models pre-trained on VessShape show strong few-shot segmentation performance, requiring only 4–10 samples for fine-tuning. They also exhibit notable zero-shot capabilities, segmenting vessels in unseen domains without any target-specific training.

Conclusion: Shape-biased pre-training with synthetic vessel geometries is an effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity and improve cross-domain generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

### [74] [NegoCollab: A Common Representation Negotiation Approach for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27647)
*Congzhang Shao,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Yue Hu,Danni Wang,Yilin Liu,Rui Pan,Bo Chen,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab proposes a negotiated common representation to align heterogeneous agents in collaborative perception, using a negotiator to derive a shared representation from local modalities and mutual sender-receiver transformations, reinforced by structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses to distill knowledge into the sender.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immutable heterogeneity across agents creates domain gaps in intermediate features, degrading collaborative performance. Aligning to a shared representation can reduce training cost and improve alignment, but existing methods tie the common representation to a single agent, which fails when other agents differ greatly.

Method: Introduce a negotiator during training to derive a common representation from local representations of each modality's agent. Use a sender/receiver pair to enable mutual transformation between local and common representation spaces. Add structural alignment loss and pragmatic alignment loss in addition to distribution alignment loss to supervise training and distill knowledge from the common representation into the sender.

Result: The approach aims to reduce domain gaps among heterogeneous agents and improve collaborative perception performance by learning a shared multimodal representation and effectively distilling its knowledge into the sender.

Conclusion: NegoCollab offers a principled negotiated common representation framework for heterogeneous collaboration. By aligning local representations to a shared multimodal space and enabling knowledge distillation into the sender, it seeks robust performance across diverse agents with manageable training costs.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Pengjun Huang,Hengyuan Zhang,Hubin Du,Yongtao Liu,Yinglin Wang,Qang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) for bounding box similarity and regression, addressing IoU and Wasserstein limitations; achieves state-of-the-art tiny-object detection on AI-TOD-v2 and generalizes to COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based similarity is sensitive to small localization errors; Wasserstein distance proposed for Gaussian bounding boxes but lacks scale invariance and, as a loss, leads to slow convergence and suboptimal precision; a scale-invariant, jointly-optimizable metric is needed.

Method: Propose Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) that models bounding boxes as Gaussian distributions and jointly optimizes center and size differences; analyze its gradient to show scale invariance and coupling; use GCD as both a regression loss and a label-assignment metric; validate across detectors.

Result: GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-v2 tiny-object detection across detectors; demonstrates generalization to MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019, outperforming Wasserstein Distance across dataset scales.

Conclusion: GCD provides a scale-invariant, jointly-optimizable similarity measure and regression loss for bounding boxes, improving localization accuracy and generalization; backed by extensive experiments and released code.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

*Samuel Degnan-Morgenstern,Alexander E. Cohen,Rajeev Gopal,Megan Gober,George J. Nelson,Peng Bai,Martin Z. Bazant*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general unsupervised deep-denoising framework for operando microscopy that preserves physics and reduces noise, enabling automated analyses across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement noise in operando microscopy limits resolution and quantitative interpretation; a modality-agnostic denoising approach is needed to integrate into quantitative workflows.

Method: Develop unsupervised deep learning-based denoising; validate with simulated data to ensure physical fidelity and minimal bias, and assess impact on PDE-constrained optimization; apply to experiments across STXM (LFP), optical microscopy (graphite electrodes), and neutron radiography.

Result: Denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in PDE-constrained model learning; reveals nanoscale chemical/structural heterogeneity; enables automated segmentation and phase classification; reduces noise-induced variability by ~80% in neutron radiography for heterogeneous lithium transport.

Conclusion: Deep denoising is a modality-agnostic enhancement that strengthens quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of noise-limited techniques across diverse microscopy modalities.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

### [77] [Vision Transformer for Robust Occluded Person Reidentification in Complex Surveillance Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27677)
*Bo Li,Duyuan Zheng,Xinyang Liu,Qingwen Li,Hong Li,Hongyan Cui,Ge Gao,Chen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Vision Transformer (Sh-ViT) for occluded person re-id with a final-layer Shuffle module, scenario-adapted augmentations, and DeiT-based distillation, achieving strong results on MyTT and Market-1501.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surveillance ReID suffers from occlusion, viewpoint changes, and low image quality. Existing methods rely on heavy modules or perform poorly on non-frontal images. There is a need for a robust, lightweight model that generalizes to real-world occlusions.

Method: Introduce a Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to disrupt spatial correlations and increase occlusion/blur robustness; apply scenario-adapted augmentation (geometrics transforms, erasing, blur, color adjustment) to simulate surveillance conditions; use DeiT-based knowledge distillation to leverage limited labels. Provide MyTT dataset (over 10k pedestrians, 30k+ images) with frequent occlusion and camera variation for real-world evaluation.

Result: Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines; 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market-1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sh-ViT enhances robustness to occlusion and blur without relying on extra external modules, offering a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical
solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends vision-language models to 3D PET/CT with a large lesion-level dataset and a 3D mask-aware model (PETAR-4B) that generates spatially grounded radiology reports, improving report quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel in 2D imaging but struggle with 3D medical data, especially PET/CT, which involves volumetric data, dispersed small lesions, and the need for spatially grounded reporting. A large, lesion-annotated dataset and 3D VLMs are needed to enable clinically coherent, localized findings.

Method: Constructed a dataset of over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams using a hybrid rule-based and large-language-model pipeline. Introduced PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that fuses PET, CT, and lesion contours to produce spatially grounded radiology reports.

Result: Automated and human evaluations show significant improvements in report generation quality and 3D medical VLM understanding with PETAR-4B.

Conclusion: This work advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling spatially grounded, clinically coherent reporting for PET/CT through a large-scale lesion-focused dataset and a dedicated 3D VLM.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

### [79] [Phased DMD: Few-step Distribution Matching Distillation via Score Matching within Subintervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27684)
*Xiangyu Fan,Zesong Qiu,Zhuguanyu Wu,Fanzhou Wang,Zhiqian Lin,Tianxiang Ren,Dahua Lin,Ruihao Gong,Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that improves upon Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) by using progressive distribution matching over subintervals of the SNR range and score matching within each subinterval, augmented with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to boost capacity. It aims to overcome capacity limits and instability in multi-step distillation, preserving output diversity and enabling distillation of large image/video models (e.g., Qwen-Image 20B, Wan2.2 28B) into efficient one-step generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMD efficiently distills into one-step generators but struggles with complex tasks due to limited model capacity. Extending to multi-step distillation increases memory and depth, causing instability. Stochastic gradient truncation reduces diversity. There is a need for a scalable, high-capacity distillation framework that maintains diversity.

Method: Phased DMD introduces two core ideas: (1) progressive distribution matching by partitioning the SNR range into subintervals and refining the model toward higher SNRs, and (2) score matching within each subinterval. The approach leverages Mixture-of-Experts to boost capacity and opt for rigorous mathematical derivations to ensure objective accuracy within subintervals. The method is validated by distilling state-of-the-art image and video generators (Qwen-Image 20B, Wan2.2 28B).

Result: Experiments show Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining core generative capabilities, enabling distillation of large models into efficient generators.

Conclusion: Phased DMD blends phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to reduce learning difficulty and enhance capacity for multi-step distillation, improving stability and diversity. Code and models are planned for release.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learnable lifting-wavelet network (LifWavNet) for radar-to-ECG reconstruction within a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis (MRAS) framework, enhanced by a multi-resolution STFT loss, achieving superior ECG reconstruction and downstream vital-sign estimation with interpretable multiresolution features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable unobtrusive, non-contact ECG monitoring from radar signals and address limitations of fixed wavelet methods in capturing physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms.

Method: Introduce LifWavNet, a lifting wavelet network with learnable lifting and inverse lifting units embedded in a MRAS framework; apply a multi-resolution STFT loss to enforce temporal and spectral fidelity to ground-truth ECG; visualize intermediate features to support interpretability; evaluate on two public datasets.

Result: LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radar-to-ECG reconstruction and improves downstream heart-rate and heart-rate variability estimation; intermediate feature visualization demonstrates interpretability of the multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis.

Conclusion: LifWavNet provides a robust, interpretable framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement with improved fidelity and physiological relevance.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

*Svetlana Churina,Niranjan Chebrolu,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Repeated exposure to false but confident facts during continual pre-training can cause persistent shifts in LLMs' factual beliefs. The paper introduces Layer of Truth to quantify belief dynamics across checkpoints, scales, and question types, revealing drift in well-established facts and across layers, highlighting a vulnerability in continual updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the illusory truth effect in humans, the work investigates whether continual pre-training makes LLMs susceptible to internalizing misinformation, addressing a gap in understanding how updates affect factual integrity.

Method: Introduce Layer of Truth framework and a dataset. Inject controlled poisoned data during continual pre-training and probe intermediate representations across checkpoints, model scales, and question types to measure belief drift in facts.

Result: Even minimal exposure can induce persistent representational drift in established facts. Susceptibility varies by layer and model size; drift occurs across checkpoints and across scales, indicating a robust vulnerability in continual updating.

Conclusion: Continually updated LLMs are vulnerable to misinformation akin to human illusory truth. The work underscores the need for monitoring/fending mechanisms to maintain factual integrity during updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SmoothGuard, a lightweight defense for multimodal LLMs against adversarial perturbations by injecting Gaussian noise, producing multiple outputs, and clustering embeddings to select the majority-consensus answer; demonstrates improved robustness on POPE, LLaVA-Bench In-the-Wild, and MM-SafetyBench with an optimal noise range of 0.1–0.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, posing safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. There is a need for defense methods that are lightweight, model-agnostic, and preserve utility.

Method: Generalize adversarial image generation within the HuggingFace ecosystem. Introduce SmoothGuard: perturb continuous modalities (images, audio) with Gaussian noise, generate multiple candidate outputs, and apply embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarial predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, providing stability under malicious perturbations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench shows that SmoothGuard enhances resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive utility. Ablation studies identify an optimal noise range of 0.1–0.2 that balances robustness and utility.

Conclusion: SmoothGuard offers a practical, model-agnostic defense that improves the robustness of multimodal LLMs to adversarial manipulations with minimal degradation in utility, suggesting a viable path for safer deployment of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

*Kangkang Sun,Jun Wu,Minyi Guo,Jianhua Li,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPF frames differential-privacy-aware fair federated learning as a zero-sum game between fairness constraints and privacy, highlighting a fundamental privacy–fairness tension and a non-monotonic fairness–utility tradeoff. It achieves notable bias reduction with competitive accuracy, and underscores the need for balanced compromises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fair, privacy-protecting federated learning and to quantify the intrinsic tradeoffs among privacy, fairness, and utility in multi-client settings.

Method: Introduce FedPF, a differential-privacy aware fair FL algorithm that reformulates multi-objective optimization as a zero-sum game between fairness constraints, privacy protection, and model utility. The paper analyzes the theoretical tension and non-monotonic effects, and validates the approach on benchmark datasets.

Result: Empirical results show up to 42.9% reduction in discrimination across three datasets with competitive accuracy. Theoretically, stricter privacy can impede bias detection/correction, revealing an unavoidable privacy–fairness tension. A non-monotonic fairness–utility relationship emerges, with moderate fairness improving generalization before degrading performance.

Conclusion: Fairness and privacy objectives in FL are inherently linked; achieving both requires deliberate balancing compromises rather than isolated optimization. The work provides a principled framework and practical results for privacy-aware fairness in federated learning, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

*Zhiyuan Ning,Jiawei Shao,Ruge Xu,Xinfei Guo,Jun Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAS-Spec introduces Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding with Dynamic Tree Cascade to accelerate self-speculative decoding by combining dynamic inference acceleration with multi-level draft routing, achieving better speedups than existing on-the-fly methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the performance gap between on-the-fly speculative decoding and training-based acceleration, enabling faster, scalable lossless LLM inference without heavy training costs.

Method: CAS-Spec builds speculative draft models using dynamic switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) techniques such as layer sparsity and activation quantization. It also introduces Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC), which adaptively routes across multi-level draft models and assigns draft lengths using heuristics based on acceptance rates and latency predictions.

Result: The approach delivers state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative decoding methods, with average speedups from 1.1x to 2.3x over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs/datasets. DyTC further improves average speedup by 47% over cascade-based baselines and 48% over tree-based baselines.

Conclusion: CAS-Spec can be readily integrated into most existing LLMs and shows strong potential for further acceleration as self-speculative decoding methods evolve.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

*Mahsa Valizadeh,Rui Tuo,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BI-DCGAN extends DCGAN with Bayesian weight uncertainty via Bayes by Backprop and mean-field VI, providing increased diversity and robustness with efficient training; covariance-based theoretical proof supports improved sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs suffer from mode collapse and lack of uncertainty awareness; there is a need for generative models that are diverse and capable of expressing uncertainty in real-world applications.

Method: Integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network weights and uses mean-field variational inference for efficient posterior approximation during GAN training; provides covariance-matrix based theoretical analysis claiming enhanced diversity; empirical validation on standard benchmarks shows improved diversity and robustness with maintained training efficiency.

Result: BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs, while keeping training efficiency; theoretical results are supported by experiments on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bayesian modeling in GANs offers scalable improvements in diversity and uncertainty handling; BI-DCGAN is a practical alternative to diffusion models when resources are limited, enabling diverse and uncertain outputs with efficient training.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

### [86] [Integrating Ontologies with Large Language Models for Enhanced Control Systems in Chemical Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26898)
*Crystal Su,Kuai Yu,Jingrui Zhang,Mingyuan Shao,Daniel Bauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An ontology-integrated LLM framework for chemical engineering that aligns with the COPE ontology through a data-to-finetune pipeline, employing controlled decoding and a citation gate to ensure grounding, and evaluating linguistic quality alongside ontological accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address grounding, interpretability, and reliability gaps in LLMs when applied to safety-critical engineering domains by fusing structured domain knowledge with generative models.

Method: Pipeline includes data acquisition, semantic preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping to COPE; generates templated QA pairs for fine-tuning; uses control-focused decoding and a citation gate to constrain outputs to ontology-linked terms; proposes evaluation metrics for linguistic quality and ontological accuracy; discusses feedback and extensions like semantic retrieval and iterative validation.

Result: Frames a theoretical framework with proposed metrics and mechanisms; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Symbolic-knowledge grounding combined with neural generation yields a transparent, auditable approach for applying LLMs in process control, safety analysis, and other critical engineering contexts.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

*Kshitij Nikhal,Luke Ackerknecht,Benjamin S. Riggan,Phil Stahlfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cluster-based archetype discovery plus few-shot forecasting improves EV charging demand forecasts at unseen sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of small datasets, simplistic temporal models, and poor generalization by leveraging large-scale data to identify site archetypes and tailor forecasts.

Method: Cluster sites to derive archetypes, then apply few-shot forecasting with archetype-specific expert models; compare to global baselines on a large-scale charging dataset and unseen sites.

Result: Archetype-specific models outperform global forecasts on unseen sites; improved forecast accuracy; actionable segmentation insights for cost, energy/pricing strategies, and grid resilience.

Conclusion: Forecast-based infrastructure segmentation can guide operator decisions, enabling cost reductions, better energy pricing, and improved grid resilience in EV adoption.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

*Zimeng Huang,Jinxin Ke,Xiaoxuan Fan,Yufeng Yang,Yang Liu,Liu Zhonghan,Zedi Wang,Junteng Dai,Haoyi Jiang,Yuyu Zhou,Keze Wang,Ziliang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MM-OPERA is a large open-ended association benchmark for LVLMs, featuring 11,497 instances across Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association (ICA). It uses free-form responses and explicit reasoning paths, evaluated by tailored LLMs acting as judges with process-informed judgments. The study reveals current LVLMs' limitations in associative reasoning and provides datasets and code to advance more human-like AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate a fundamental but underexplored cognitive ability—association—in LVLMs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that focus on closed-ended tasks and shallow pattern matching. The work aligns evaluation with human psychometric principles and aims to drive more creative, integrative reasoning in AI.

Method: Proposes MM-OPERA with 11,497 instances across two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association (ICA). Requires free-form responses and explicit reasoning paths. Employs specialized LLM-as-a-Judge strategies with process-reward-informed judgment to analyze outputs and reasoning. Conducts comprehensive analyses (sensitivity, validity of LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, diversity across abilities, domains, languages, cultures) to benchmark LVLMs.

Result: Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains, languages, cultures, etc., yielding a nuanced understanding of the current limitations in associative reasoning and highlighting variability across factors.

Conclusion: The MM-OPERA dataset and code are publicly available, providing a resource to push LVLMs toward more human-like, general-purpose associative reasoning and serving as a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

### [89] [Mind the Gaps: Auditing and Reducing Group Inequity in Large-Scale Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26940)
*Ashwin Kumar,Hanyu Zhang,David A. Schweidel,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairness-aware incremental sampling (FGIS) with Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM) reduces demographic performance gaps in mobility prediction by up to 40% with minimal accuracy loss, using census-informed proxy race labels and group-aware sampling on MetaPath2Vec and a transformer encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hidden demographic disparities in next-location prediction; dataset biases lead to unequal performance across user groups; individual demographic labels are unavailable, necessitating privacy-preserving, data-centric fairness solutions for mobility apps.

Method: Introduce SAKM to cluster users in latent mobility space while enforcing census-derived group proportions to infer proxy racial labels for four groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White). Build FGIS to incrementally sample training data, prioritizing users by potential performance gains and maintaining group representation, yielding fairer training sets with minimal accuracy loss.

Result: Reduce demographic disparity by up to 40% across models (MetaPath2Vec and a transformer-encoder) with minimal overall accuracy trade-offs; gains are largest in early sampling; demonstrates effectiveness of data-centric fairness interventions in low-resource settings; highlights structural inequities in mobility prediction pipelines.

Conclusion: Lightweight, data-centric interventions using proxy demographic signals can meaningfully improve fairness in mobility prediction pipelines without substantial complexity; promising for high-stakes, low-data contexts, though raises considerations about privacy, generalization, and reliance on proxy labels.

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

### [90] [Can machines think efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26954)
*Adam Winchell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-constrained version of the Turing Test to evaluate AI intelligence via efficiency and resource costs, adding a measurable finish line to the original imitation game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Turing Test is becoming inadequate as AI advances and raises ethical/environmental concerns; there is a need for a test that accounts for finite resources and provides a practical completion criterion.

Method: Extend the imitation game by adding an energy cost constraint on responses; define an efficiency metric to balance speed, accuracy, and energy expenditure; establish a finite finish line for evaluation.

Result: A conceptual framework that yields a measurable finish line and an energy-aware criterion for intelligence, enabling comparisons of speed gains against total resource costs.

Conclusion: Energy-constrained evaluation reframes AI assessment toward efficiency and resource-awareness, guiding policy and societal trade-offs between performance gains and resource use.

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

### [91] [Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957)
*Qiao Wang,Joseph George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Open-access imagery (satellite, Google Street View) plus simple geospatial covariates can predict household water use in India with accuracy approaching survey-based models; GSV segmentation with covariates performs best among tested methods; middle-class estimates suffer from overlapping visual proxies; offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and time burden of enumerating or surveying households for water-use data in rapidly urbanizing regions by leveraging publicly available imagery and simple geospatial features.

Method: Compare four approaches to predict ordinal household water use: (1) survey features (benchmark), (2) CNN embeddings from satellite, GSV, and a combined set, and (3) GSV semantic maps with auxiliary data (nightlight, population density). Use an ordinal classification framework and evaluate accuracy. Perform error analysis and compare estimates to subjective income.

Result: GSV segmentation with remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy, approaching survey-based models at 0.59 accuracy. The model shows high precision at the distribution tails (extremes of water use) but confusion among middle classes due to overlapping visual proxies. Open-access imagery with minimal geospatial data yields a promising alternative to surveys for urban analytics of household water consumption.

Conclusion: Public imagery plus lightweight geospatial covariates can yield reliable household water-use estimates, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional surveys in urban analytics, especially in rapidly urbanizing settings.

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

### [92] [Fine-Grained Iterative Adversarial Attacks with Limited Computation Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26981)
*Zhichao Hou,Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Under a fixed compute budget, the paper introduces a fine-grained recomputation strategy to maximize the strength of iterative adversarial attacks by selectively recomputing layer activations across iterations and layers, outperforming baselines at the same cost and enabling adversarial training with only 30% of the original budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI safety research often faces compute constraints. Reducing the number of attack iterations saves cost but weakens effectiveness; the goal is to preserve or boost attack efficacy within a limited budget.

Method: A fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations at both iteration and layer levels, enabling better trade-offs between computation and attack strength.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost. When used in adversarial training, it achieves comparable performance with only 30% of the original budget.

Conclusion: Fine-grained recomputation across iterations and layers is an effective strategy for budget-constrained iterative adversarial attacks and can substantially reduce compute needs in adversarial training without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

### [93] [HADSF: Aspect Aware Semantic Control for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26994)
*Zheng Nie,Peijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage HADSF framework: adaptive vocabulary induction plus constrained extraction of aspect-opinion triples to improve information extraction for review-based recommender systems; introduces ADR and OFR metrics and reveals a nonmonotonic link between hallucination and rating error; experiments show smaller models can match larger ones with HADSF, and code is released for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based extraction in review recommender systems suffers from (i) unbounded, noisy representations due to free-form mining, (ii) lack of principled metrics tying hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) unclear cost-quality dynamics across model scales. A principled, scalable approach is needed to produce compact, reliable representations and measurable hallucination-aware benefits.

Method: Propose Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF). Stage 1 adaptively induces a compact corpus-level aspect vocabulary via data-driven selection. Stage 2 performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples from reviews. Introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR) to evaluate representation fidelity. Evaluate across ~3 million reviews using LLMs from 1.5B to 70B parameters; integrate HADSF components into standard rating predictors.

Result: HADSF yields consistent reductions in rating prediction error across models; enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance in deployment scenarios; ADR and OFR provide interpretable indicators of representation fidelity and hallucination impact; nonmonotonic relationship observed between hallucination severity and rating prediction error.

Conclusion: HADSF demonstrates effective, hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendations with scalable benefits across model sizes; authors release code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

### [94] [Gradient Descent as Loss Landscape Navigation: a Normative Framework for Deriving Learning Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26997)
*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified theoretical framework treats learning rules as policies solving an optimal-control problem over partially observable loss landscapes, from which common rules (gradient descent, momentum, natural gradients, non-gradient rules, Adam) emerge under different assumptions; continual learning strategies like weight resetting are optimal responses to task uncertainty; this offers a principled basis for designing adaptive algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning rules are often taken as given; there is little understanding of why some rules outperform others or when a rule is optimal. A unifying, principled framework can explain the computational structure of learning and guide algorithm design.

Method: Model learning rules as policies navigating partially observable loss landscapes; formulate an optimal control problem to find optimal policies; derive known rules as special cases under varying assumptions (short vs long horizon, geometry, controllability, online Bayesian inference); interpret continual learning strategies as responses to task uncertainty.

Result: Shows that gradient descent, momentum, natural gradients, non-gradient rules, and Adam emerge as optimal policies under appropriate assumptions; weight resetting and other continual-learning techniques arise as optimal responses; unifies diverse learning rules under a single objective.

Conclusion: This framework clarifies the computational structure of learning, enabling principled design of adaptive algorithms and providing a solid theoretical basis for selecting or combining learning rules based on problem assumptions.

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

### [95] [A Framework for Fair Evaluation of Variance-Aware Bandit Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27001)
*Elise Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reproducible evaluation framework for MAB algorithms that compares eight classical and variance-aware methods, showing when variance-aware approaches outperform and providing a standardized, multi-metric evaluation setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms is hard due to non-standardized conditions and replicability; it is difficult to know when variance-aware methods outperform classical ones.

Method: A reproducible evaluation framework (Bandit Playground) with clearly defined experimental setups, multiple metrics (reward, regret, reward distribution, value-at-risk, action optimality), and an interactive interface; it compares eight algorithms spanning classical and variance-aware approaches.

Result: Variance-aware algorithms offer advantages in high-uncertainty settings where subtle differences between arm rewards matter; classical algorithms perform similarly or better in more separable or well-tuned scenarios.

Conclusion: Provide a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms and gain insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform their classical counterparts.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jasmine is a scalable, reproducible JAX-based world-modeling codebase that stretches from a single host to hundreds of accelerators, delivering roughly 10× faster CoinRun reproduction than prior open implementations and enabling rigorous benchmarking with curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models promise data-efficient learning in robotics, but open training infrastructure for world modeling is underdeveloped; there is a need for scalable, reproducible, and benchmark-ready tooling.

Method: A performant JAX-based implementation with optimizations across data loading, training, and checkpointing; supports diverse sharding and scalable multi-device training; guarantees reproducible training; paired with curated large-scale datasets to enable benchmarking pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

Result: Order-of-magnitude faster reproduction of CoinRun compared to prior open implementations; fully reproducible training; scalable across hardware with diverse sharding; establishes benchmarking pipelines with curated datasets.

Conclusion: Jasmine provides a robust infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking of world-model architectures and ablations, enabling reliable evaluation across datasets and configurations.

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming
data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for
world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based
world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of
accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude
faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open
implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading,
training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training
and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

### [97] [Mixture-of-Transformers Learn Faster: A Theoretical Study on Classification Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27004)
*Hongbo Li,Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT provides a tractable theoretical framework where each transformer block is an expert controlled by a continuously trained gating network; it demonstrates that experts specialize on distinct tasks, the gating routes data accurately, gradient conflicts are mitigated, and convergence to near-zero loss occurs in O(log(ε^{-1})) steps, with empirical validation confirming the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a unified theoretical explanation, especially when both the feed-forward and attention components can specialize. The paper aims to provide a unified theory of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics.

Method: Introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) with multiple transformer experts governed by a gating network trained continuously. Propose a three-stage training algorithm that preserves continuous gating, analyze core learning dynamics to isolate expert specialization and attention alignment, prove reduced gradient conflicts and strong convexity for subtasks, and show convergence of the expected loss in O(log(ε^{-1})) iterations.

Result: Each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks; the gating network accurately routes inputs to the appropriate expert. The training dynamics reduce gradient conflicts, render subtasks strongly convex, and achieve near-zero loss in logarithmic iteration count, beating the single-transformer rate O(ε^{-1}). Empirical studies on real data validate the theoretical claims, marking the first unified account of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics.

Conclusion: MoT provides a unified theoretical framework for transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, offering practical guidance for designing efficient large-scale models and informing the development of MoE-based architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

*Sean Patten,Pin-Yu Chen,Christina Schweikert,D. Frank Hsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ensemble learning via Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) that combines RoBERTa with traditional models (RF, SVM, XGBoost) to achieve 97.072% accuracy on IMDB sentiment analysis, surpassing traditional ensembles while using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve sentiment classification performance efficiently by exploiting cognitive diversity among heterogeneous models rather than simply increasing model size or complexity.

Method: Apply CFA to an ensemble consisting of RoBERTa (transformer-based) and traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost). CFA uses rank-score characteristic functions to quantify model dissimilarity and strategically fuse predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on IMDB with 97.072%; CFA outperforms traditional ensemble methods and is comparatively resource-efficient due to focusing on diversity rather than scaling models.

Conclusion: CFA is an effective strategy for leveraging model diversity in NLP sentiment analysis, enabling high performance with potentially lower computational costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

### [99] [Quantitative Bounds for Length Generalization in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27015)
*Zachary Izzo,Eshaan Nichani,Jason D. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First quantitative bounds on the training length required for length generalization in transformers. LG occurs when the model's behavior on longer sequences can be simulated by its behavior on shorter sequences, with qualitative bounds and empirical validation across settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap that prior work showed length generalization exists above a finite training length but did not quantify how large that length must be. The paper seeks to provide quantitative bounds and conditions for when LG arises.

Method: Theoretical analysis across multiple problem settings: l_inf error control vs average error control over input distribution; infinite-precision softmax attention vs finite-precision attention (argmax); one- vs two-layer transformers. Derives bounds showing LG occurs under a simulation condition where longer-sequence behavior is replicable from shorter-sequence behavior. Provides qualitative estimates of required training data length and corroborates with empirical experiments.

Result: Derived qualitative estimates for the required training length for length generalization; proved that LG occurs when the transformer's longer-sequence dynamics can be simulated by its shorter-sequence dynamics; empirical experiments validate the bounds.

Conclusion: Deepens theoretical understanding of extrapolation in transformers and formalizes the intuition that richer training data is needed for generalization on more complex tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

### [100] [Limits of Generalization in RLVR: Two Case Studies in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27044)
*Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves metrics on two verifiable combinatorial problems but tends to reinforce shortcuts rather than genuine mathematical reasoning, revealing generalization limits and a need for benchmarks that disentangle true reasoning from shortcut exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning is a core capability for LLMs, and RL-based rewards with verifiable outcomes (RLVR) are explored to guide reasoning. However, it is unclear whether RLVR yields genuine reasoning improvements or just surface-level gains.

Method: Apply RLVR with several reward designs to two fully verifiable combinatorial tasks—Activity Scheduling and the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)—using carefully curated datasets with unique optima to distinguish true reasoning from shortcuts.

Result: Across multiple reward designs, RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than enabling new reasoning strategies; this indicates limited generalization and underscores the risk of shortcut exploitation.

Conclusion: Benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation are essential, along with faithful progress measures; RLVR’s limits motivate developing more robust evaluation frameworks. Code is available at the linked repository.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

### [101] [Consistency Training Helps Stop Sycophancy and Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27062)
*Alex Irpan,Alexander Matt Turner,Mark Kurzeja,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Consistency training enforces output and activation invariance to prompt augmentations to guard against sycophancy and jailbreaks; Bias-augmented Consistency Training (BCT) on outputs and Activation Consistency Training (ACT) on activations reduce irrelevant cues in Gemini 2.5 Flash, with BCT better at jailbreaks and simpler training pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can be swayed by prompt cues (sycophancy) or jailbreak tricks. Static datasets and fixed response guidelines may become stale, leading to degraded factuality and refusals. A self-supervised, invariance-based approach aims to make model behavior robust to irrelevant prompt signals.

Method: Two self-supervised strategies: (1) Bias-augmented Consistency Training (BCT) from Chua et al. 2025, which enforces consistency in external outputs across prompt augmentations (e.g., adding leading questions or jailbreak text); (2) Activation Consistency Training (ACT), a novel method enforcing consistency in internal activations across similar augmentations. Both use model-generated data to avoid stale labels and compare responses to augmented prompts.

Result: Both BCT and ACT reduce susceptibility to irrelevant cues and diminish sycophancy. BCT performs better at reducing jailbreak attempts, while ACT is competitive in reducing such cues. BCT may simplify training pipelines by eliminating reliance on static datasets, and both approaches illustrate that some alignment problems are better framed as consistency issues rather than as optimizing for a single correct output.

Conclusion: Recasting alignment challenges as consistency problems enables robust, self-supervised defenses against prompt-based manipulation. BCT offers practical benefits in pipeline simplicity and stronger jailbreak resistance, while ACT provides a complementary, activation-focused guard against prompt sensitivity.

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

### [102] [Towards a Measure of Algorithm Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27063)
*Shairoz Sohail,Taher Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMOC is a framework that embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space to measure similarity, enabling tasks like clustering, near-duplicate detection, and diversity assessment; it is backed by PACD, a curated Python implementation dataset, with released code and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncomputability of general algorithm equivalence and the muddiness of similarity notions by proposing a pragmatic, consistent similarity metric for applications such as clone detection and program synthesis.

Method: Introduce EMOC (Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity) framework to map algorithm implementations into a feature space; compile PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three problems; demonstrate EMOC embeddings for downstream tasks (clustering, classification, near-duplicate detection, diversity quantification); release code and data.

Result: EMOC features enable effective clustering/classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity in LLM-generated programs; provides reproducible tooling and dataset (PACD) for future work.

Conclusion: EMOC embeddings offer a practical, extensible approach to algorithm similarity analysis, supporting downstream tasks and reproducibility, with open-source resources to facilitate future research and applications.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

TL;DR: MLPerf Automotive establishes a standardized benchmark for AI acceleration in automotive systems, focusing on latency and accuracy across perception tasks (2D/3D detection, 2D segmentation) with reference models, submission rules, and reproducible protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automotive ML workloads are safety- and real-time–critical and lack appropriate benchmarks; a standardized suite enables fair cross-hardware/software comparisons and drives development.

Method: Design of a benchmark framework with task selection (2D/3D perception), reference models, latency/accuracy metrics, submission rules, and round-based benchmark submissions; collaboration between MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium; public code release.

Result: First iteration of the benchmark with defined tasks and metrics; description of design decisions, datasets acquisition challenges, reference implementations, and initial submissions; code available at a public repo.

Conclusion: A standardized, reproducible benchmark for automotive ML workloads is proposed, addressing safety/real-time constraints and enabling cross-platform performance comparisons; ongoing evolution expected as more tasks and datasets are added.

Abstract: We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for
evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in
automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in
automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be
utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints
including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object
detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the
methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference
models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark
submissions and the challenges involved in acquiring the datasets and the
engineering efforts to develop the reference implementations. Our benchmark

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-play post-training in LLMs is analyzed to uncover mechanisms behind performance gains, using the Absolute Zero Reasoner, and comparing with RLVR and SFT. The study examines sparsity of parameter updates, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions, linking these dynamics to pass@k performance, clarifying differences and limitations and suggesting directions to improve math reasoning through self-play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which self-play enhances LLM reasoning, how it differs from RLVR and supervised fine-tuning, and how its training dynamics relate to reasoning performance, with an eye toward more reliable math reasoning.

Method: Comparative analysis using the Absolute Zero Reasoner as the interpretive lens, evaluating parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions, and relating these dynamics to reasoning performance via pass@k evaluations.

Result: The study reveals how self-play’s training dynamics differ from RLVR and SFT and identifies inherent limitations of self-play in improving reasoning, supported by associations between dynamics and pass@k performance.

Conclusion: Self-play differs from other post-training strategies, shows limitations, and points to future directions for enhancing LLM math reasoning through self-play.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

*Sina Javadzadeh,Rahil Soroushmojdehi,S. Alireza Seyyed Mousavi,Mehrnaz Asadi,Sumiko Abe,Terence D. Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable cross-subject representation-learning framework for intracranial recordings using Siamese contrastive embeddings and transformer tokens, enabling zero-shot transfer and channel reconstruction across heterogeneous electrode layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject aggregation of intracranial data is hindered by variable electrode counts/placements and localization imprecision. Spatial normalization (e.g., MNI) often fails to capture true functional similarity; a shared functional space is needed for robust cross-subject analysis and pretraining.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives learns subject-agnostic, region-localized electrode embeddings from multi-region LFPs, creating a locality-sensitive functional space; (2) embeddings are tokenized and fed into a transformer that models inter-regional relationships across a variable number of channels, without subject-specific heads. Evaluation on a 20-subject basal ganglia–thalamic dataset during rest/movement with heterogeneous electrode layouts; zero-shot transfer to unseen channels and channel reconstruction are tested.

Result: The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters. It transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, indicating a robust, subject-agnostic backbone for cross-subject aggregation and downstream decoding.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable backbone for cross-subject intracranial data analysis and pretraining in settings lacking uniform sensor placement or explicit task structure, enabling large-scale aggregation and transfer learning for iEEG.

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

*Yiwei Chen,Kehuan Yan,Yu Pan,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-jump inspired multimodal fusion model (QiNN-QJ) learns entangled representations via Hamiltonian and Lindblad dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art results with interpretable entanglement entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by limitations of unitary-only quantum-inspired fusion (training instability and poor generalization); introduces dissipative dynamics and controllable entanglement to stabilize training and enhance cross-modal modeling.

Method: Encode each modality as a quantum pure state; apply a differentiable quantum jump (QJ) operator to entangle the product state; jointly learn Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators to induce controllable cross-modal entanglement with dissipative dynamics; project entangled states onto trainable measurement vectors for predictions.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS; enables enhanced post-hoc interpretability via von-Neumann entanglement entropy.

Conclusion: Presents a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion using quantum-jump dynamics and dissipative stabilization, paving the way for quantum-inspired approaches to cross-modal correlations.

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a hierarchical Bayesian deconvolution model to infer cell-type proportions and cell-type gene expression from bulk RNA-seq using a single-cell reference; applied to endometrium across the menstrual cycle to reveal dynamic composition and cell-type-specific differential expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bulk RNA-seq mixtures obscure cell-type–level dynamics. A probabilistic framework leveraging high-resolution single-cell references can recover cell-type proportions and cell-type expression changes, enabling study of hormone-driven tissue remodeling.

Method: A probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model for deconvolving bulk RNA-seq into cell-type expression profiles and proportions, anchored by a single-cell reference. The approach details priors and inference strategy, and evaluates performance via simulations and comparisons to existing methods.

Result: The model reveals dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions across menstrual phases, and identifies cell-type–specific differential expression (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). Robustness tests show resilience to reference mismatches and noise.

Conclusion: A principled Bayesian framework enables inference of cell-type composition and cell-specific expression changes from bulk data, with implications for fertility and endometrial disorders; future work includes integration with spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained offline policy optimization for fairness in group-wise rewards using a doubly robust estimator, with convergence guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline contextual bandits can inadvertently widen reward disparities across groups when maximizing total reward; there is a need to enforce fairness constraints under limited resources.

Method: Introduce group-wise reward disparity constraints into an off-policy gradient-based optimization framework; employ a doubly robust estimator to estimate disparities; provide convergence guarantees for policy optimization.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world data show reduced group-wise reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: A fairness-aware offline policy optimization approach that is theoretically grounded and empirically validated, effectively reducing disparities without sacrificing major rewards.

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Method: Literature review and synthesis of agentic AI architectures (e.g., ReAct, Reflection, Supervisor, Swarm), mapping them to drug-discovery tasks, with examples of deployments and performance metrics.

Result: Demonstrates substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability; workflows compressed from months to hours; applicable across literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end decision-making; maintains scientific traceability in deployed systems.

Conclusion: Current challenges include data heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking; future directions include stronger integration of agentic AI in science and translation, with attention to governance, evaluation, and scalability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in
drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic
AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out

architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm
systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery,
including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol
generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end

to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI
systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations
demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability,
compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining
scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data
heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline
future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.

*Hong Jiao,Hanna Choi,Haowei Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Essay-based automated scoring generally outperforms rationale-based scoring, but rationale-based scoring improves F1 for underrepresented score 0. Ensemble methods that combine essay-based and rationale-based signals yield the best performance, with QWK 0.870 (surpassing the 0.848 benchmark in the literature).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether GPT-generated rationales can support automated scoring and whether combining rationale-based signals with traditional essay-based scoring can improve performance, particularly in the context of class imbalance.

Method: Using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP dataset, compare essay-based scoring with rationale-based scoring (rationales produced by GPT-4.1 and GPT-5). Evaluate performance with Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) and F1 scores. Examine ensembles: essay-based alone; rationale-based alone; essay + each rationale; and essay + both rationales, reporting the best overall scoring accuracy.

Result: Generally, essay-based scoring yields higher QWK than rationale-based scoring. Rationale-based scoring achieves higher F1 for score 0, likely due to class imbalance. Ensembles improve accuracy; the best result is an ensemble of essay-based scoring with both rationale-based signals, achieving QWK of 0.870, which exceeds the literature benchmark of 0.848.

Conclusion: Ensembling essay-based scores with GPT-generated rationales can enhance automated scoring performance, offering particular benefits for underrepresented classes. Future work could optimize prompting, rationale generation, and ensemble strategies to further improve metrics.

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

*Minh Phu Vuong,Young-Ju Lee,Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Chul-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairAD is a scalable fair graph clustering method that uses an algebraic-distance-based affinity and graph coarsening to enforce fairness constraints, achieving competitive fairness while being up to 40x faster than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in machine learning has drawn attention; clustering on graphs should ensure protected-group proportions match overall dataset, especially for large graphs where existing fair clustering methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Construct an affinity matrix via algebraic distance that encodes fairness constraints; apply graph coarsening to obtain representative nodes corresponding to k clusters; solve a constrained minimization to obtain the fair clustering solution.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a modified stochastic block model and six public datasets shows FairAD achieves fair clustering and is up to 40 times faster than state-of-the-art fair graph clustering algorithms.

Conclusion: FairAD provides a computationally efficient approach to fair graph clustering that scales to large graphs while maintaining fairness, offering significant speedups without sacrificing fairness.

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: RelTune uses a relational-graph representation of DBMS parameter dependencies with GNN embeddings and a Hybrid-Score-guided Bayesian Optimization to outperform traditional BO in tuning complexity and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DBMS tuning often assumes parameter independence and relies on surrogate models that struggle with high-dimensional search and parameter interactions, leading to inefficient optimization.

Method: Model parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and learn GNN-based latent embeddings that capture performance-relevant semantics. Propose Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO) combining surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score that measures proximity to previously high-performing configurations, guiding exploration.

Result: RelTune achieves faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based approaches, delivering state-of-the-art performance across multiple DBMSs and workloads.

Conclusion: RelTune effectively captures parameter interactions via a relational graph and GNN embeddings, paired with HBO, to drive superior automatic configuration tuning for DBMSs across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

### [113] [Exploring Landscapes for Better Minima along Valleys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27153)
*Tong Zhao,Jiacheng Li,Yuanchang Zhou,Guangming Tan,Weile Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptor E (ALTO) for gradient-based optimizers extends search beyond local minima by exploring loss valleys, yielding better generalization in large-batch training; demonstrated with Lamb, achieving ~2.5% accuracy gain and proven convergence in convex/non-convex settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tendency of gradient-based optimizers to stop at local minima and the difficulty of ensuring global optimality and generalization in deep learning loss landscapes; promise of flatter minima for better generalization; improve large-batch training performance.

Method: Introduce adaptor E to gradient-based optimizers, creating ALTO (adapted Lamb) that continues exploration along valleys after reaching a minimum; provide convergence proofs for convex and non-convex cases; empirical evaluation on large-batch tasks using Lamb as baseline.

Result: ALTO increases test accuracy by about 2.5% on diverse large-batch tasks compared to state-of-the-art, indicating improved generalization; supports the feasibility of valley-driven optimization.

Conclusion: Valley-aware adaptors like E offer a new direction in optimizer design with practical benefits for generalization, particularly in large-batch training; further research could explore broader applicability and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

### [114] [Adaptive Defense against Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Bayesian Data Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27172)
*Zixuan Hu,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Yongxian Wei,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS) for harmful fine-tuning defense without attack simulations, using a posterior over data safety attributes to weight training data; includes an amortized neural scheduler for efficient adaptation; achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety risks of fine-tuning-as-a-service by defusing harmful data; overcome limitations of simulation-based defenses that only cover bounded threat models and lack adaptability to varying attack settings.

Method: Formulates defense as Bayesian inference; learns per-data safety posteriors conditioned on fine-tuning and alignment datasets; weights training data by safety attribute samples drawn from the posterior; uses post hoc conditioning to tailor defense to a given dataset; introduces an amortized neural scheduler for efficient transfer to new data without retraining.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse attack and defense settings; comprehensive results show robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: BDS enables adaptive, simulation-free defense against harmful fine-tuning, tailored to individual datasets and transferable to new data via amortized learning; code released.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

### [115] [A Polynomial-time Algorithm for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Improved Regret Bound under Weaker Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27177)
*Junfan Li,Shizhong Liao,Zenglin Xu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A polynomial-time algorithm for online sparse linear regression under the compatibility condition achieves improved regret bounds by using a Dantzig-selector-based estimator with novel sampling, adaptive tuning, and batching online Newton steps; extended to a setting with extra observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSLR with limited feature access is NP-hard; prior polynomial-time methods rely on stronger feature-structure assumptions. The paper aims to weaken assumptions (compatibility condition) and improve regret, pushing theoretical guarantees closer to practical performance.

Method: Leverage Dantzig Selector with an algorithm-dependent covariance estimation scheme, adaptive parameter tuning, and batching online Newton steps. Provide new analyses: induction for ℓ1-norm error, covariance handling for non-independent data, and regret decomposition. Extend to OSLR with extra observations (k0 attributes after each prediction) to further improve regret.

Result: A new polynomial-time algorithm under compatibility condition with improved regret bounds over prior work (Ito et al., 2017). Tighter convergence rate of the ℓ1-norm error; novel covariance analyses; and an induction-based error analysis. Extension to enhanced-observation OSLR setting yields stronger guarantees compared with Kale et al. (2017) and Ito et al. (2017).

Conclusion: The work shows that combining Dantzig-selector-inspired estimation with targeted online optimization techniques yields better theoretical guarantees under weaker structural assumptions and remains effective in extended observation scenarios, contributing new analytical tools for ℓ1-error and covariance behavior in online sparse learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

### [116] [SERFLOW: A Cross-Service Cost Optimization Framework for SLO-Aware Dynamic ML Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27182)
*Zongshun Zhang,Ibrahim Matta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SERFLOW introduces a hybrid FaaS/IaaS framework that partitions ML models into stage-based blocks, provisioning resources per stage and balancing load across VMs and serverless functions to reduce cloud costs by over 23% while adapting to dynamic workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world factors neglected by prior work (e.g., VM cold starts, long-tail service times) to improve adaptive ML inference by balancing processing and transmission delays cost-effectively.

Method: Model each ML query as an acyclic sequence of stages with contiguous sparse parameter blocks; implement stage-specific resource provisioning that reflects exit rates at each stage; perform adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless containers based on request ingestion; leverage FaaS for dynamic scaling and IaaS for persistent resources.

Result: Cloud costs are reduced by more than 23% with effective adaptation to dynamic workloads.

Conclusion: A stage-aware, hybrid FaaS/IaaS orchestration (SERFLOW) effectively addresses underutilization and burst handling in adaptive ML inference, offering cost-efficient dynamic provisioning.

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

*Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDAS-GNN is a multi-dimensional attention-based spatial-diffusion GNN for accident risk forecasting that integrates traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risks; it delivers superior short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts and up to 40% error reduction via ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accident prediction models neglect complex spatial-temporal dependencies in urban networks, hindering accurate risk assessment and planning.

Method: Proposes MDAS-GNN with feature-specific spatial diffusion and multi-head temporal attention across three risk dimensions; evaluated on UK DfT data for Central London, South Manchester, SE Birmingham; includes ablation studies.

Result: Outperforms baselines with lower prediction errors across time horizons; strong long-term forecasting; ablation shows integrated features beat single-feature models, reducing error by up to 40%.

Conclusion: The framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with improved predictive capability for road network design, resource planning, and safety interventions, facilitating data-driven urban development.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

### [118] [Feature-Function Curvature Analysis: A Geometric Framework for Explaining Differentiable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27207)
*Hamed Najafi,Dongsheng Luo,Jason Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFCA introduces a 4D feature signature (Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, Interaction) and its dynamic extension to monitor training; reveals hierarchical learning and enables diagnostics for capacity and overfitting, offering a geometric, time-aware explanation beyond static attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI methods often collapse a feature's influence into a single static score, failing to capture non-linearity, interactions, and learning dynamics. A geometry- and time-aware framework can provide deeper, more trustworthy explanations and practical diagnostics.

Method: Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA) computes a 4D signature per feature (Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, Interaction) by analyzing the curvature of the learned function. It extends to Dynamic Archetype Analysis to track how these signatures evolve during training, enabling observations of hierarchical learning (simple linear effects learned before complex interactions).

Result: Static and dynamic FFCA offer a geometric context for explanations. The study reports direct empirical evidence of hierarchical learning and shows FFCA can diagnose insufficient model capacity and predict the onset of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the framework adds meaningful, time-aware interpretability beyond traditional attribution.

Conclusion: FFCA, with its static and dynamic components, provides a more complete, trustworthy explanation of the entire learning process by embedding explanations in the geometry of the model’s function and its evolution during training.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

### [119] [Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222)
*Jaebyeong Jeon,Hyeonseo Jang,Jy-yong Sohn,Kibok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR designs projection heads as experts to selectively capture shared vs task-specific information in joint invariant/equivariant learning, reducing redundancy and boosting transfer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jointly learning invariant and equivariant representations helps downstream tasks but current setups with separate heads miss shared information, causing redundant features and inefficient capacity.

Method: Introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR) that treats projection heads as experts and routes features to specialized heads; encourages specialization in shared vs task-specific information; validate by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.

Result: Observes reduced canonical correlations and consistent transfer-task gains across diverse benchmarks; code released.

Conclusion: STAR reduces redundant feature learning and makes better use of model capacity in joint invariant/equivariant representation learning.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

### [120] [FedSM: Robust Semantics-Guided Feature Mixup for Bias Reduction in Federated Learning with Long-Tail Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27240)
*Jingrui Zhang,Yimeng Xu,Shujie Li,Feng Liang,Haihan Duan,Yanjie Dong,Victor C. M. Leung,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSM tackles non-IID long-tail bias in federated learning with semantics-guided feature mixup and local classifier retraining, using a pretrained image-text model to identify category semantics and generate class-consistent pseudo-features from global prototypes; probabilistic category selection mitigates domain shift and keeps server overhead low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning often yields biased global models under non-IID and long-tail data distributions. There is a need for a client-centric method that reduces bias without heavy server-side computation or data sharing, preserving privacy.

Method: FedSM uses a pretrained image-text aligned model to compute category-level semantic relevance and guide category selection of local features. Local features are mixed with global prototypes to produce class-consistent pseudo-features; a lightweight classifier is retrained locally. Probabilistic category selection increases feature diversity to better mitigate domain shift. All computations are performed on-device, minimizing server overhead.

Result: Experimental results on long-tail datasets with varying imbalances show FedSM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with strong robustness to domain shift and favorable computational efficiency due to on-device processing.

Conclusion: FedSM provides a client-centric solution that reduces classifier bias in FL by semantically guided feature mixup and local retraining, achieving higher accuracy and robustness while preserving privacy and keeping server-side costs low.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

### [121] [Not All Instances Are Equally Valuable: Towards Influence-Weighted Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27253)
*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce Influence-Weighted Distillation (IWD) that uses influence functions to weight each training instance by its impact on the distillation objective, improving the quality of distilled datasets and boosting model accuracy (up to 7.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real datasets, not all instances are equally useful; redundant or harmful data can degrade distillation performance. A principled way to account for data quality is needed.

Method: Compute influence of each instance on the distillation objective via influence functions, assign adaptive weights to instances, integrate weights into the distillation loss; modular design allows plugging into various distillation frameworks.

Result: Empirical results show improved distilled-data quality and model performance, with accuracy gains up to 7.8%.

Conclusion: IWD provides a principled, modular enhancement to dataset distillation by weighting data by estimated influence; broadly applicable across distillation frameworks and yields notable performance gains.

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

*Xin Tang,Youfang Han,Fangfei Gou,Wei Zhao,Xin Meng,Yang Yu,Jinguo Zhang,Yuanchun Shi,Yuntao Wang,Tengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECVL-ROUTER: a scenario-aware router for vision-language models that directs most queries to a small edge model, reducing latency and energy while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User requirements vary across scenarios (fast response, high-quality output, low energy). Relying solely on large cloud models leads to high latency and energy costs; small edge models handle simpler tasks with lower latency/energy. A router that dynamically selects the appropriate model can leverage both strengths to maximize overall utility.

Method: Proposes a new per-query routing strategy and evaluation metrics. Builds a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router training. Validates the approach through extensive experiments.

Result: Routes over 80% of queries to the small model with less than 10% drop in problem-solving probability.

Conclusion: First scenario-aware routing framework for vision-language models; demonstrates improved overall utility by effectively leveraging both large and small models. Includes a dataset for router training and validation showing practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

### [123] [Higher-order Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27258)
*Yifan Zhang,Zhen Qin,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA) is a causal, streaming attention mechanism that captures higher-order interactions with a constant-size state in its second-order form, achieving linear per-token computation without materializing n×n matrices. It provides closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant with two extra summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme via associative scans that exactly reproduces serial recurrence activations; with extensions to higher orders, positioning HLA as a scalable, data-dependent, attention-like component that retains the efficiency of recurrent architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention hinders scaling autoregressive models to long contexts. Linear-time alternatives (e.g., linear attention, SSMs) often sacrifice expressivity by staying at first-order or kernel-based approximations. There is a need for a scalable, expressive mechanism that supports higher-order interactions and exact recurrence behavior.

Method: Introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal streaming mechanism that uses compact prefix sufficient statistics to realize higher interactions. In the second-order setting, it keeps a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without forming any n×n matrices. The paper provides closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans that exactly reproduces the activations of a serial recurrence. It also outlines extensions to third and higher orders.

Result: HLA achieves linear-time per token with constant memory, avoiding large matrices, and can exactly reproduce serial recurrence activations via associative scans, enabling scalable training and inference for long-context modeling. The framework is extensible to higher orders, offering a principled blend of attention-like mixing with the efficiency of recurrent architectures.

Conclusion: HLA proposes a principled, scalable building block that merges attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. It provides the foundations for higher-order, cost-effective attention mechanisms suitable for long-context modeling, with a project page linked for implementation and experimentation.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

*Han Yu,Kehan Li,Dongbai Li,Yue He,Xingxuan Zhang,Peng Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ODP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance prediction to standardize and fairly evaluate models across diverse OOD datasets and distribution shifts, with publicly provided trained models and in-depth analysis of capability boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation protocols for OOD performance prediction are inconsistent and rely on limited real-world datasets and shift types, hindering fair comparisons and progress.

Method: Introduce Out-of-Distribution Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), assemble commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance prediction algorithms, provide trained models as a testbench to ensure consistent comparisons without retraining, and perform thorough experimental analyses to map the capability boundaries of current methods.

Result: ODP-Bench offers a broad, reusable benchmark platform that covers widely used OOD datasets and prediction algorithms; it provides trained models as a testbench to guarantee consistent comparisons and reduces the burden of retraining, along with diverse experimental analyses to understand where methods perform well or poorly across shifts.

Conclusion: ODP-Bench enables convenient and fair benchmarking of OOD performance prediction and clarifies limitations of current methods, guiding future research and deployment in risk-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

### [125] [HiF-DTA: Hierarchical Feature Learning Network for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27281)
*Minghui Li,Yuanhang Wang,Peijin Guo,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,Shengqing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiF-DTA is a hierarchical dual-pathway model for drug–target affinity prediction that jointly models global sequence semantics and local topological features for drugs and proteins, with multi-scale drug representations (atomic, substructural, molecular) fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention module, achieving state-of-the-art results on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequence-based DTA approaches largely rely on flat sequence representations and often miss the interplay between global sequence semantics and local topological/structural features, especially at multiple scales in drugs. A model that jointly captures global and local information and multi-scale drug representations could improve predictive performance and generalization.

Method: Propose HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network with a dual-pathway architecture that extracts both global sequence semantic features and local topological features from drug and protein sequences. It models drugs at multiple scales (atomic, substructural, molecular) and fuses these representations with a multi-scale bilinear attention module to predict DTA.

Result: HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets. Ablation studies show that both global-local feature extraction and multi-scale fusion contribute to performance gains.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling global and local sequence features and incorporating multi-scale drug representations via a bilinear fusion mechanism yields improved DTA predictions, highlighting the importance of hierarchical, multi-scale feature learning in drug–target affinity modeling.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

### [127] [Temporal Cardiovascular Dynamics for Improved PPG-Based Heart Rate Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27297)
*Berken Utku Demirel,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A nonlinear-chaos perspective on heart-rate dynamics using mutual information to boost real-world HR estimation; integrates with deep learning; evaluated on four real-life datasets with ablations, showing up to 40% improvement and simplified sensing/post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart-rate fluctuations are inherently nonlinear and potentially chaotic. Traditional methods struggle in everyday conditions and with limited sensing modalities; a theory-driven, data-driven approach could improve robustness and practicality for continuous health monitoring.

Method: Study non-linear chaotic behavior via mutual information and introduce a novel approach that enhances HR estimation in real-life conditions. Integrates with deep learning to improve estimation; validated with four real-world datasets and extensive ablations comparing against existing algorithms.

Result: The proposed method yields up to 40% better heart-rate estimation than traditional methods and existing ML techniques, while reducing the number of sensing modalities required and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Conclusion: Incorporating mutual information to capture nonlinear temporal complexity and pairing it with deep learning can substantially improve real-world HR monitoring, offering a simpler, more robust pipeline suitable for wearables; further validation and detail are warranted.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

*Rodrigo Matos Carnier,Laura Lahesoo,Kensuke Fukuda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Streaming learning with tree-based models robustly detects IoT anomalies under concept drift; Adaptive Random Forest performs best with high accuracy and lower cost, while dataset heterogeneity limits evaluation of model limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concept drift and online adaptability in IoT anomaly detection, compare batch vs streaming learning, and assess the effectiveness of tree-based methods.

Method: Simulated heterogeneous IoT data streams by mixing existing datasets and streaming samples sequentially; compared batch and streaming learning approaches; evaluated tree-based (Adaptive Random Forest, Hoeffding Adaptive Tree) versus non-tree-based algorithms; reported F1-scores and computational costs.

Result: Batch models fail to handle concept drift; current datasets still limit exposure of model weaknesses due to low traffic heterogeneity. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1=0.990±0.006 at ~1/3 computational cost of batch version; Hoeffding Adaptive Tree achieved F1=0.910±0.007 with ~1/4 computational cost, trading some stability for online viability.

Conclusion: Streaming, especially tree-based methods like Adaptive Random Forest, offers strong anomaly detection performance with lower costs in online IoT settings; dataset limitations hinder full evaluation of model robustness and concept drift handling.

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

### [129] [Un-Attributability: Computing Novelty From Retrieval & Semantic Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27313)
*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Defines un-attributability as semantic novelty for model outputs and uses a two-stage retrieval (GIST embeddings + ColBERTv2) to decide if outputs lack pretraining attribution, evaluating SmolLM/SmolLM2 and finding longer data influence, domain effects on novelty, and that instruction tuning increases novelty; releases ~20 TB of data to support replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model outputs relate to pretraining data by asking which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example, i.e., measuring semantic novelty and enabling scalable analysis at pretraining scale.

Method: Invert traditional data attribution by proposing un-attributability. Use a two-stage retrieval pipeline: index corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings, retrieve top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. Compare model outputs to human references to determine novelty. Evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2 across domains and with/without instruction tuning.

Result: Findings include: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much longer spans than previously reported; (2) certain domains systematically promote or suppress novelty; (3) instruction tuning increases novelty. The work also provides a data release (~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts) to facilitate replication and large-scale extension of the analysis.

Conclusion: Framing novelty as un-attributability enables efficient, scalable analysis of pretraining-scale outputs and supports replication; the proposed retrieval-based novelty measure can reveal how training data and instruction tuning shape semantic novelty in language models.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

### [130] [MedM2T: A MultiModal Framework for Time-Aware Modeling with Electronic Health Record and Electrocardiogram Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27321)
*Yu-Chen Kuo,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedM2T is a time-aware multimodal framework for irregular medical time series that uses sparse encoding, hierarchical temporal fusion, and cross-modal attention, achieving state-of-the-art results on MIMIC datasets for CVD prediction, mortality, and LOS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data are inherently multimodal and temporally irregular, with heterogeneous sampling and gaps across modalities. Existing models struggle to jointly leverage diverse signals (e.g., ECG, labs) and align their granularities. A unified framework that can flexibly encode sparse series, fuse temporal patterns at multiple scales, and model cross-modal interactions is needed for robust clinical prediction.

Method: Three components: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to handle irregular, sparse time series; (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture micro- and macro-temporal patterns across dense time series (e.g., ECG) from multiple modalities; (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to learn cross-modal interactions, extensible to multiple modalities. The approach uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns features within a shared encoder to mitigate granularity gaps, evaluated on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG for tasks including 90-day CVD prediction, in-hospital mortality, and ICU LOS regression.

Result: MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal and time-series baselines, achieving AUROC 0.947 and AUPRC 0.706 for 90-day CVD prediction; AUROC 0.901 and AUPRC 0.558 for mortality prediction; and MAE 2.31 for LOS regression on MIMIC datasets.

Conclusion: MedM2T demonstrates robustness and broad applicability in clinical prediction, positioning it as a promising tool for multimodal clinical forecasting; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at
https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T.

### [131] [Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338)
*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outcome-based RL often yields opaque chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning across reasoning models, hindering monitoring; forcing legible CoTs reduces accuracy, and legibility declines on harder questions, with no simple link between legibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether legible CoTs can be trusted as indicators of model intent and safety, by evaluating legibility across models and its relationship to accuracy and difficulty.

Method: Empirical study across 14 reasoning models comparing legible versus full CoT outputs. Measure CoT legibility to humans and AI monitors, accuracy when restricted to legible portions (and when resampling), and performance across question difficulty. Explore hypothetical causes for legibility loss (steganography, training artifacts, vestigial tokens).

Result: Most models (except Claude) produce illegible CoTs while final answers remain readable. Illegible reasoning can help reach correct answers; forcing legible CoTs reduces accuracy by about 53%. No consistent correlation between legibility and performance under resampling. Legibility degrades on harder questions.

Conclusion: Outcome-based RL without explicit optimization for legibility tends to yield increasingly opaque reasoning, potentially undermining monitoring approaches; addressing legibility in training objectives or developing robust monitoring beyond legible CoTs may be necessary.

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

### [132] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces monitorability for chain-of-thought (CoT) by combining faithfulness and verbosity into a monitorability score; shows faithfulness alone is insufficient for safety monitoring; evaluates on BBH, GPQA, MMLU; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond partial faithfulness proxies toward a holistic measure of how informative CoT traces are for external working memory and monitor safety.

Method: Define verbosity (listing all necessary factors) and faithfulness (alignment with internal reasoning). Combine into a monitorability score; empirical evaluation on instruction-tuned and reasoning models over BBH, GPQA, MMLU; release code via Inspect.

Result: Some models appear faithful but are hard to monitor due to missing factors; monitorability varies across model families; results motivate rethinking CoT-based safety tools.

Conclusion: Monitorability complements faithfulness for evaluating CoT; improvements in model design to enhance transparency; providing evaluation tools to foster reproducible research.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

### [133] [FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Junchao Zhou,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMuon offers a matrix-aware federated optimization: locally enforcing matrix orthogonalization with Muon, and globally aligning updates via momentum aggregation and local-global alignment to curb client drift, achieving linear speedup without heterogeneity and showing empirical gains in IID and non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard FL optimizers (e.g., Adam/SGD) treat weights element-wise and ignore the geometric structure of weight matrices. This can amplify problematic directions, deteriorate conditioning, and slow convergence, especially under communication constraints.

Method: Introduce Local Muon for matrix-structured local updates through orthogonalization. In non-IID settings, address drift with FedMuon: (1) momentum aggregation, reusing aggregated momentum for local initialization, and (2) local-global alignment, aligning local gradients with the global update direction. Provide a theoretical linear speedup convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption (involving S clients per round, K local steps, and R rounds). Empirically validate on language and vision models.

Result: In IID, Local Muon accelerates convergence and reduces communication rounds compared with Local SGD and Local AdamW. In non-IID, independent matrix orthogonalization based on local data causes strong client drift. FedMuon mitigates drift via momentum aggregation and local-global alignment, achieving linear speedup without heterogeneity assumptions. Empirically, FedMuon reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy on language and vision tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedMuon provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution for FL with matrix-structured parameters. By combining matrix-aware local updates with global alignment mechanisms, it mitigates non-IID drift, achieves linear speedup, and delivers empirical gains in accuracy and communication efficiency.

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

### [134] [Atlas-Alignment: Making Interpretability Transferable Across Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27413)
*Bruno Puri,Jim Berend,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Atlas-Alignment transfers interpretability across language models by aligning their latent spaces to a human-interpretable Concept Atlas using only shared inputs and lightweight alignment, enabling semantic feature search and steerable generation with minimal labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability pipelines are costly and hard to scale, requiring model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual labeling, and extensive validation; there is a need for scalable, transferable interpretability across models.

Method: Representational alignment of unknown latent spaces to a labeled Concept Atlas using shared inputs and lightweight, model-agnostic alignment techniques; no labeled concept data required; once aligned, semantic retrieval and steering along atlas concepts are possible.

Result: The approach achieves robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation across models without labeled concept data, and reduces the marginal cost of interpretability by amortizing it through one high-quality Concept Atlas.

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment can dramatically lower the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability by enabling many models to become transparent and controllable with minimal additional labeling, once a Concept Atlas is established.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

*Meenu Ravi,Shailik Sarkar,Yanshen Sun,Vaishnavi Singh,Chang-Tien Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal, probabilistic, end-to-end ML pipeline (MVeLMA) predicts county-level post-wildfire vegetation loss using ensemble methods, yielding uncertainty-aware predictions and confidence maps to guide recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-wildfire vegetation loss is central to ecological recovery, but existing studies struggle with capturing evolving ecosystem features, multiple contributing factors, and model interpretability. There is a need for an interpretable, uncertainty-aware predictive framework that can inform targeted recovery and policy decisions.

Method: Proposes MVeLMA: an end-to-end ML pipeline with multimodal feature integration and a stacked ensemble architecture, incorporating probabilistic modeling for uncertainty estimation and generating vegetation loss confidence maps for high-risk counties.

Result: MVeLMA outperforms several state-of-the-art and baseline models in predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss and provides confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, enabling targeted disaster relief planning and ecological management.

Conclusion: The work advances multimodal, uncertainty-aware vegetation loss prediction, offering actionable insights for recovery planning and policy-making by yielding interpretable, county-level risk assessments.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

*Angelica Liguori,Ettore Ritacco,Pietro Sabatino,Annalisa Socievole*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral-preserving graph sparsification framework that jointly evolves graph structure and features to produce faithful reduced proxies, enabling efficient downstream tasks while maintaining spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks rely on fixed structures and face over-smoothing; large graphs incur high computational costs. There is a need for reduced, faithful graph representations that preserve spectral characteristics to enable efficient community detection, influence propagation, and diffusion tasks.

Method: Introduces the Spectral Preservation Network with two components: (1) a Joint Graph Evolution layer that jointly transforms graph topology and node features across layers, allowing adaptive structural and attribute evolution; (2) a Spectral Concordance loss that enforces consistency between the graph's spectral properties and node feature vectors, guiding the learned reductions.

Result: The approach is evaluated on node-level sparsification using established metrics and benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods, with results indicating superior performance and clear advantages over competing approaches.

Conclusion: Spectral Preservation Network provides faithful, computationally efficient reduced graph proxies that preserve essential spectral and feature information, enabling effective downstream tasks at a lower cost.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

*Bernardo Williams,Victor M. Yeom-Song,Marcelo Hartmann,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Euclideanized approach for simplex distributions: map the open simplex to Euclidean space using Aitchison-geometry bijections, apply Dirichlet interpolation to dequantize discrete data, model density in Euclidean space, and recover the original discrete distribution exactly. It competes with Riemannian-geometry or noise-based simplex methods on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional data naturally lie on a simplex. Existing methods often rely on Riemannian geometry or bespoke noise processes, which can complicate sampling and density estimation. A Euclidean-space approach that respects Aitchison geometry and still allows exact recovery of the discrete distribution would simplify modeling and improve practicality.

Method: Define smooth bijections between the open simplex and Euclidean space guided by Aitchison geometry. Use Dirichlet interpolation to dequantize discrete observations into continuous ones. Perform density modeling in Euclidean space via the bijection and map back to the simplex, ensuring exact recovery of the original discrete distribution while respecting Aitchison geometry.

Result: Claims competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating the practicality of the Euclidean-space approach while preserving simplex geometry.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables Euclidean-space density modeling for simplex-supported distributions that respects Aitchison geometry and allows exact recovery of discrete distributions, offering a simpler alternative to Riemannian-geometry or noise-based methods with competitive results.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world

### [138] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes sampling-based analysis of chain-of-thought (CoT) distributions to understand causal influence and computation, using resampling to probe decisions, interventions, and resilience across four case studies; shows single CoT samples are insufficient and on-policy resampling yields clearer causal narratives and principled interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study of reasoning models often focuses on a single CoT, but models define distributions over many possible CoTs. Fully specifying this distribution is intractable; sampling provides a practical way to understand causal influence and underlying computation, enabling more reliable interpretability and steerability.

Method: 1) Resample specific sentences to measure downstream causal effects in agentic misalignment scenarios; 2) Compare on-policy resampling with off-policy edits to CoT that aim to steer decisions; 3) Introduce a resilience metric by repeatedly resampling to prevent content from reappearing downstream after removals; 4) Adapt causal mediation analysis to examine how hints influence outputs without being explicitly mentioned, and their sustained effect on CoT.

Result: Findings include: self-preservation sentences have small causal impact on actions; off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling; resilience-based removal shows critical planning statements resist removal but exert large effects when eliminated; unmentioned hints can causally affect outputs and subtly influence CoT in a persistent, cumulative way even after removal.

Conclusion: Studying CoT distributions via resampling yields more reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled on-policy CoT interventions, advancing interpretability and steerability of reasoning models.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

### [139] [FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Kewen Zhu,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAdamW is a federated learning optimizer that adapts AdamW to heterogeneous client data by introducing a local correction mechanism and decoupled weight decay, reducing variance in second-moment estimates, reinitializing moments, and aggregating their means for improved convergence without assuming data heterogeneity. It delivers linear speedup in convergence and better generalization via PAC-Bayesian analysis, with empirical gains on language and vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW, while effective for large models, suffers in federated settings due to data heterogeneity and client drift, high variance in second-moment estimates, and slow convergence due to reinitializing moments. There is a need to tailor AdamW to FL to achieve fast, stable training and good generalization.

Method: Introduce FedAdamW with a local correction mechanism that aligns local updates with the global update, decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting, and aggregation of the mean of second-moment estimates to reduce variance and reinitialize them. Provide theoretical convergence proof of linear speedup without assuming heterogeneity, and use PAC-Bayesian analysis to explain decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically validate on language and vision Transformers, comparing against baselines and showing reduced communication rounds and improved test accuracy.

Result: FedAdamW achieves linear speedup convergence in FL without heterogeneity assumption by combining local correction and decoupled weight decay, with variance reduction via mean-second-moment aggregation and moment reinitialization. PAC-Bayesian analysis supports decoupled weight decay for better generalization in local training; empirical results show reduced communication rounds and higher test accuracy on Transformer-based language and vision models.

Conclusion: FedAdamW effectively extends AdamW to federated learning, addressing heterogeneity-induced variance, local overfitting, and convergence delays. It offers theoretical guarantees (linear speedup) and generalization insights, with practical performance gains on large-scale models.

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

### [140] [InertialAR: Autoregressive 3D Molecule Generation with Inertial Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27497)
*Haorui Li,Weitao Du,Yuqiang Li,Hongyu Guo,Shengchao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Canonical tokenization and geometry-aware transformer enable state-of-the-art 3D molecule generation with hierarchical autoregression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable 3D molecule generation with autoregressive transformers, two core challenges must be solved: (i) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence that is invariant to SE(3) transformations and atom-index permutations, and (ii) modeling hybrid atom-based tokens that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates.

Method: 1) Canonical tokenization by aligning molecules to inertial frames and reordering atoms to achieve SE(3) and permutation invariance. 2) Geometry-aware attention via geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE). 3) Hierarchical autoregression: predict the next atom-based token by first predicting the atom type, then its 3D coordinates using a diffusion loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of 10 evaluation metrics for unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable (targeted) generation, attaining state-of-the-art results across all 5 controllable-generation metrics.

Conclusion: InertialAR advances 3D molecule generation by marrying invariant canonical tokenization with geometry-aware transformers and a hierarchical autoregressive scheme, delivering strong results in both unconditional and controllable molecular design.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all
5 metrics.

### [141] [DP-FedPGN: Finding Global Flat Minima for Differentially Private Federated Learning via Penalizing Gradient Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27504)
*Junkang Liu,Yuxuan Tian,Fanhua Shang,Yuanyuan Liu,Hongying Liu,Junchao Zhou,Daorui Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-FedPGN introduces a global gradient norm penalty into CL-DPFL to target global flat minima, reducing gradient clipping error and improving generalization under DP. It leverages Rényi DP guarantees, analyzes theoretical effects of DP, and shows strong gains on ResNet and Transformer across six tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CL-DPFL approaches focus on local flatness (e.g., via SAM) which may not reflect global flatness in heterogeneous, DP-protected FL. This mismatch leads to degraded generalization. There is a need for global flat minima and reduced clipping error to improve DP-FL performance.

Method: Propose DP-FedPGN, a CL-DPFL algorithm that adds a global gradient norm penalty to local losses to encourage global flat minima. The penalty also reduces the norm of locally updated parameters, mitigating gradient clipping error. The approach includes theoretical analysis of DP robustness, leverages Rényi DP for strict privacy guarantees, and provides local-update sensitivity analysis. Experiments on ResNet and Transformer validate performance across six visual/NLP tasks, with code released.

Result: DP-FedPGN achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms across six tasks on both vision and NLP models, validates flatter global minima and reduced clipping error, and demonstrates robust privacy guarantees via Rényi DP with favorable convergence under data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN effectively mitigates DP-related performance degradation, counters heterogeneity effects, and yields faster convergence by promoting global flat minima through a global gradient norm penalty, all while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

### [142] [Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517)
*Zherui Yang,Zhehao Li,Kangbo Lyu,Yixuan Li,Tao Du,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-generated SPAI preconditioners enable GPU-friendly CG with no triangular solves, yielding substantial GPU speedups for PDE-derived systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CG with SPD systems benefits from effective preconditioners; traditional preconditioners limit learning opportunities and fail to exploit data-driven optimization on GPUs; there is a need for GPU-friendly, scalable, data-driven preconditioners whose design aligns with CG convergence properties.

Method: Use Graph Neural Networks to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, avoiding incomplete factorization and triangular solves; ensure only two matrix-vector products per CG iteration; leverage local propagation in GNNs; introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss that reflects CG convergence dependence on condition number; evaluate on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset.

Result: The proposed method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and prior learning-based preconditioners on GPUs; achieves significant reductions in CG solution time on GPUs (about 40–53% faster) and improves condition numbers and generalization.

Conclusion: GNN-based SPAI preconditioners provide GPU-friendly, scalable, and generalizable preconditioning for CG by avoiding triangular solves and exploiting local GNN propagation; the scale-invariant loss aligns learning with CG convergence behavior driven by the condition number.

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

*Théo Gnassounou,Yessin Moakher,Shifeng Xie,Vasilii Feofanov,Ievgen Redko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two pretraining regimes for a time-series foundation model (real-world heterogeneous TS data vs synthetic data) enable strong EEG performance on motor imagery and sleep stage tasks, outperforming EEGNet and CBraMod; cross-domain pretraining can transfer to EEG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether general time-series foundation models can transfer to EEG, a domain with domain-specific signals, potentially accelerating brain signal analysis by leveraging broader TS literature.

Method: Evaluate a recently proposed TS foundation model on EEG tasks (motor imagery and sleep stage). Compare two pretraining strategies: (a) heterogeneous real-world TS pretraining, (b) synthetic data pretraining; compare against EEGNet and CBraMod baselines.

Result: Both pretraining variants yield strong performance and consistently outperform EEGNet and CBraMod; EEG benefits from cross-domain TS pretraining.

Conclusion: Generalist time-series foundation models pretrained on diverse real or synthetic data can transfer to EEG, underscoring cross-domain pretraining as a promising direction for brain signal analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian domain adaptation with active learning improves data efficiency in population-based SHM by leveraging limited labeled target data and informative sampling across multiple structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and distribution shifts across structures hinder learning in PBSHM; need online updating as labels become available.

Method: A Bayesian DA framework that enhances unsupervised domain adaptation with a limited amount of labeled target data, integrated into an active sampling strategy to select informative observations for labeling; evaluated on experimental bridges with multiple damage states and environmental conditions.

Result: Combining transfer learning and active learning improves data efficiency for learning target classifiers in label-scarce PBSHM settings; can reduce inspections and operating costs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of data-informed operation and maintenance using Bayesian DA and active learning to efficiently adapt across structures and conditions.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

*Yuxiang Chen,Xiaoming Xu,Pengle Zhang,Michael Beyer,Martin Rapp,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 4-bit end-to-end quantized training method (TetraJet-v2) using NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients, plus three techniques—unbiased double-block quantization, OsciReset, and OutControl—to tackle weight oscillation and outliers, achieving substantial FP4 training gains over prior methods and narrowing the FP gap by ~51% on LLM pre-training up to 370M params and 200B tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is prohibitively expensive; reducing precision to 4-bit could dramatically cut compute and memory, but maintaining accuracy is challenging due to issues like weight oscillation and outliers.

Method: Introduce TetraJet-v2: end-to-end 4-bit FQT with NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients in all linear layers. Propose three components: (1) unbiased double-block quantization for NVFP4 linear layers, (2) OsciReset to suppress weight oscillation, and (3) OutControl to preserve outlier accuracy.

Result: TetraJet-v2 consistently outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across model sizes up to 370M and data up to 200B tokens, reducing the performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Conclusion: End-to-end 4-bit FQT with the proposed components enables closer-to-FP performance for LLM pre-training at much lower precision, addressing key optimization challenges and delivering substantial efficiency gains; future work could explore scaling to larger LLMs and further refinements to quantization blocks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

TL;DR: Adaptive, secure RAG framework for financial QA (AstuteRAG-FQA) that blends open-source and proprietary data, uses dynamic prompts, and enforces regulatory compliance with four-task classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance is knowledge-intensive and highly regulated; standard RAG struggles with proprietary data access, retrieval accuracy, privacy, and compliance, risking misinformation and violations.

Method: Hybrid retrieval (open-source + proprietary) with strict security (differential privacy, anonymization, RBAC), dynamic task-aware prompting, four-tier task classification (explicit factual, implicit factual, interpretable rationale, hidden rationale), real-time regulatory validation, and evaluation of three data-integration techniques (contextual embedding, small model augmentation, targeted fine-tuning).

Result: Framework proposal with a planned comparative analysis across data-integration techniques; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA offers a secure, compliant, and adaptive RAG blueprint for financial QA, capable of leveraging hybrid data sources and real-time regulatory checks to improve precision and reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

### [147] [ORGEval: Graph-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs in Optimization Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27610)
*Zhuohan Wang,Ziwei Zhu,Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Yizhou Han,Yufeng Lin,Zhihang Lin,Angyang Gu,Xinglin Hu,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORGEval is a graph-based, solver-free evaluation framework that detects structural equivalence of optimization models to assess LLMs' ability to formulate MILP/LP problems, using a WL-test under a symmetry-decomposable condition; it achieves 100% consistency and faster runtimes, enabling Bench4Opt benchmarking; DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 lead under direct prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust metrics to evaluate LLMs in optimization problem formulation; solver-based metrics suffer from inconsistency, infeasibility, and high computational costs; a graph-theoretic, structure-focused evaluation can provide a robust, numerically invariant measure of LLM capability.

Method: Represent optimization models as graphs and reduce equivalence to graph isomorphism. Prove a sufficient condition: if graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test detects isomorphism. Integrate a tailored WL variant with an SD-detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence; use this framework to build the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark LLMs on optimization modeling.

Result: The approach successfully detects model equivalence and yields 100% consistency across random parameter configurations. It outperforms solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Using ORGEval, Bench4Opt enables benchmarking, with DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 achieving the highest accuracies under direct prompting, surpassing even leading reasoning models.

Conclusion: Graph-based, structure-focused evaluation provides a robust, scalable metric for benchmarking LLMs in optimization modeling. ORGEval enables reliable equivalence detection and faster evaluation, though optimization remains challenging for LLMs, with certain models showing superior performance under direct prompting.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

### [148] [Panprediction: Optimal Predictions for Any Downstream Task and Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27638)
*Sivaraman Balakrishnan,Nika Haghtalab,Daniel Hsu,Brian Lee,Eric Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panprediction is a unifying framework that extracts information from data so a model can minimize many losses on many downstream tasks. It subsumes omniprediction and multi-group learning, offering favorable sample complexity: deterministic ~1/ε^3, randomized ~1/ε^2. A nearly lossless reduction to a calibration notion (step calibration) underpins the results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised learning optimizes a single fixed loss on a fixed distribution. The panprediction paradigm aims to learn representations that enable near-simultaneous minimization of infinitely many losses across infinitely many tasks, potentially enabling transfer across losses and tasks.

Method: Designs algorithms to learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with sample complexities tilde O(1/ε^3) and tilde O(1/ε^2), respectively. Establishes a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to step calibration.

Result: Under mild assumptions, minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Improves the best known sample complexity of deterministic omniprediction by a factor of 1/ε and matches all known guarantees for omniprediction and multi-group learning.

Conclusion: Panprediction provides a general, statistically efficient framework bridging omniprediction and multi-group learning, with a key technical link to step calibration.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

### [149] [Imbalanced Classification through the Lens of Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27650)
*Jakob Hackstein,Sidney Bender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Imbalance amplifies Clever Hans effects; a counterfactual-explanations approach using Explainable AI identifies and removes these effects, achieving competitive performance on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is known to degrade performance, but existing data- or loss-reweighting strategies do not address the underspecification of minority classes that enables Clever Hans effects. The paper reframes imbalance as a data condition that intensifies CH biases and seeks to diagnose and mitigate them.

Method: A counterfactual explanations–based approach that leverages Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate Clever Hans effects that arise under imbalance.

Result: The method achieves competitive accuracy on three datasets and demonstrates how Clever Hans effects emerge under imbalance, offering a perspective overlooked by prior methods.

Conclusion: By linking imbalance to CH effects and using counterfactual explanations to mitigate them, the approach provides both competitive performance and diagnostic insights into how imbalance shapes model behavior.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

### [150] [Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651)
*Shuyan Lyu,Zhanzimo Wu,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable layer-wise training framework for modern CNNs that uses deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and matrix-based Renyi entropy to learn minimal, task-relevant representations. Each layer is trained with an auxiliary classifier connected to the output, enabling memory-efficient learning without backpropagation, achieving competitive performance to SGD on CIFAR-10/100 and traffic sign recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of global cross-entropy training and backpropagation in deep networks—namely biological implausibility and high memory usage—by developing a scalable, layer-wise training method that performs well on modern CNNs and large datasets.

Method: Train each layer jointly with an auxiliary classifier linked directly to the output layer. Leverage deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi entropy to drive learning toward minimal sufficient representations that are task-relevant, revealing a bottom-up convergence consistent with a Markov information bottleneck principle.

Result: The proposed layer-wise training approach outperforms existing layer-wise baselines and achieves performance comparable to SGD on CIFAR-10/ CIFAR-100, and demonstrates applicability to real-world tasks such as traffic sign recognition.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of scalable, memory-efficient layer-wise training for modern CNNs, grounded in information-theoretic principles, and shows that layer-wise optimization can yield competitive performance with end-to-end backpropagation while mitigating gradient issues and reducing memory usage.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

### [151] [Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659)
*Alireza Saleh Abadi,Leen-Kiat Soh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Open MARL openness (agent, task, type) disrupts credit assignment; new taxonomy and empirical evidence show openness causes credit misattribution and performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how openness affects credit assignment in MARL and address the limitations of static-population CA methods by providing a taxonomy and empirical evidence.

Method: Conceptual analysis introducing sub-categories of openness; empirical study using representative temporal and structural MARL algorithms in open settings to assess CAP.

Result: Openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss landscapes and notable performance degradation across tasks/agents.

Conclusion: Traditional credit assignment methods are inadequate for open MARL; openness-aware credit assignment approaches are needed. This work lays groundwork via a taxonomy and empirical demonstration of the issue.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

### [152] [Force Characterization of Insect-Scale Aquatic Propulsion Based on Fluid-Structure Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26837)
*Conor K. Trygstad,Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work reports the first force measurements of insect-scale single- and double-tailed microrobotic propulsors driven by shape-memory alloy tails, using a reactive-force framework and micro-force sensing to quantify thrust and extract FSI insights for microrobotic propulsion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterize and understand fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effects on thrust generation in insect-scale propulsors to enable reliable aquatic locomotion and simple 2D trajectory control for microrobots.

Method: A reactive-force theoretical framework is used alongside experimental data collected with a micro-N-resolution force sensor. Two devices (single-tail and dual-tail) driven by SMA wires are tested; maximum and cycle-averaged thrust are measured across multiple trials; results are analyzed to interpret FSI and propulsion efficiency in 2D motion.

Result: Single-tail: max thrust 0.45 mN; cycle-averaged thrust 2.97 μN. Dual-tail: max thrust 0.61 mN; cycle-averaged thrust 22.6 μN.

Conclusion: This study provides the first instantaneous thrust measurements for insect-scale propulsors of this type and offers insights into fluid-structure interaction for efficient microrobotic propulsion, validating the use of SMA-driven, energetically favorable tails for 2D swimming control.

Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale
propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers
that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs
of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by
soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory
alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable
for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures
for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics
and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.
In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the
notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization
using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and
cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and
2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail
propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test
means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the
first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale
propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient
microrobotic propulsion.

*Jahir Argote-Gerald,Genki Miyauchi,Julian Rau,Paul Trodden,Roderich Gross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Distributed multi-agent maze traversal on acyclic graphs using a leader-switching mechanism; scales to hundreds of agents; matches full-knowledge strategies in efficiency while improving over naive approaches; demonstrated in simulation and real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate multiple robots through maze-like environments under communication and congestion constraints; existing centralized or fully-informed strategies don't scale or require global knowledge; need scalable, distributed algorithms.

Method: One agent acts as head following a single-agent maze solver; others pick agents to follow; head role transfers to neighboring agents to maintain path consistency with a single agent; applicable to acyclic graph representations; evaluated with up to 300 agents and multiple solvers; compared to naive and global-knowledge strategies; real-world Pi-puck experiments.

Result: Outperforms naive in makespan and sum-of-fuel; better makespan than global-communication strategy, but worse sum-of-fuel; asymptotically equivalent to full-knowledge strategy for both metrics; real-world experiments with up to 20 robots confirm feasibility.

Conclusion: The leader-switching multi-agent maze traversal is scalable and effective under limited communication, approaching full-knowledge performance and viable for real robot deployments.

Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique
challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication
constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a
distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be
represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one
agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the
other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to
neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a
single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in
simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple
single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive,
or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The
algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and
sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of
makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it
is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to
either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots
confirm the feasibility of the approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviTrace is a high-quality VQA benchmark for robotic navigation where models output 2D navigation traces in image space, evaluated across 1000 scenarios with 3000 expert traces and eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a semantic-aware trace score that combines DTW distance, endpoint error, and embodiment-based penalties; reveals gaps to human performance due to spatial grounding and goal localization, and provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark with a leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a bottleneck in evaluating navigation capabilities of vision-language models for robotics due to costly real-world trials, oversimplified simulations, and limited benchmarks. A scalable, realistic benchmark is needed to quantify spatial grounding, goal localization, and embodiment-aware behavior in navigation tasks.

Method: Introduce NaviTrace: a benchmark where inputs include an instruction and an embodiment type (human, legged, wheeled, bicycle) and outputs a 2D navigation trace in image space. Evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs across ~1000 scenarios and >3000 expert traces using a semantic-aware trace score that fuses Dynamic Time Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned per-pixel semantic penalties.

Result: Across the evaluation, a consistent gap to human performance is observed, predominantly due to poor spatial grounding and goal localization in the models. NaviTrace provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark and leaderboard for real-world robotic navigation research.

Conclusion: NaviTrace offers a scalable benchmark for real-world robotic navigation with a semantically informed evaluation metric, enabling fair comparisons across VLMs and highlighting specific weaknesses (spatial grounding and goal localization) that future models should address.

Abstract: Vision-language models demonstrate unprecedented performance and
generalization across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. Integrating these
foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward
building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation
capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified
simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality
Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and
embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a
2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000
expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a
newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time
Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties
derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our
evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial
grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and
reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and

*Zachary Ravichandran,Fernando Cladera,Ankit Prabhu,Jason Hughes,Varun Murali,Camillo Taylor,George J. Pappas,Vijay Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPINE-HT is a three-stage LLM-grounded framework for heterogeneous robot teams operating in unstructured environments. It improves task success and robustness, achieving about 87% real-world success and ~2x the prior LLM-based approaches in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-enabled planning often assumes structured environments and known capabilities. Real-world heterogeneous robot teams must ground language in physical capabilities and adapt to online information in open-world settings. This work aims to bridge that gap by grounding LLM reasoning in robot capabilities and online feedback.

Method: A three-stage process: (1) an LLM generates grounded subtasks from mission goals and team capabilities and checks feasibility; (2) subtasks are assigned to robots based on traversability, perception, etc., with adjustments from online feedback; (3) subtasks are refined during operation using closed-loop perception/control, demonstrated in simulation and real-world experiments with a Jackal, Husky, Spot, and a high-altitude UAV.

Result: Simulation experiments with closed-loop perception/control show nearly twofold improvement in success rate over prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming approaches. Real-world experiments achieved an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about capabilities and online refinement.

Conclusion: Grounding LLM reasoning in concrete robot capabilities and online feedback enables robust, adaptable heterogeneous robot teams for unstructured missions. SPINE-HT effectively integrates language, capability awareness, and feedback-driven refinement, scaling to diverse hardware and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

*Yunhao Yang,Neel P. Bhatt,Pranay Samineni,Rohan Siva,Zhanyang Wang,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RepV learns a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable to verify compliance with natural-language rules in a single forward pass, offering probabilistic guarantees and efficient refinement with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal methods provide guarantees but rely on hand-crafted temporal logic; deep-learning offers flexible constraint evaluation but is opaque. RepV aims to unify these by learning a safety-separable latent space that supports scalable, probabilistic verification of natural-language rules in safety-critical planning.

Method: Starting from a seed set of plans labeled by a checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector to embed each plan along with a language-model-generated rationale into a low-dimensional space. A frozen linear boundary then determines compliance for unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass. The approach additionally yields a probabilistic guarantee on verification correctness based on latent-space position and uses this to refine planners without extra human annotation.

Result: Empirical results show up to 15% improvement in compliance-prediction accuracy over baselines with fewer than 0.2M additional parameters. The refinement framework also outperforms standard fine-tuning across multiple planning domains.

Conclusion: Safety-separable latent spaces provide a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for neurosymbolic plan verification, enabling probabilistic guarantees and efficient planner refinement. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

TL;DR: A hermetic, transparent soft vine robot for inside non-branching pipes is designed, integrated with an enclosed sensor-capable tip, and validated in a real wastewater pipe for condition assessment and mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aging pipelines require accurate internal condition assessment; soft-growing vine robots are promising for navigating confined pipe interiors but face subsystem complexity and lack of real-world validation; there is a need for a robust, field-ready, hermetic system that enables visual sensing inside pipes.

Method: Develop a hermetic, transparent vine robot that encloses all mechanical and electrical components within a soft, airtight body; design and test a passively adapting enclosed tip mount to carry sensors; model and validate the mechanism; perform a real-world condition assessment and mapping task in a wastewater pipe.

Result: The concept was validated: a hermetic, transparent vine robot with an enclosed tip has been demonstrated and field-tested in a wastewater pipe, showing robust operation and enabling visual sensing and mapping in confined pipe environments.

Conclusion: This work advances soft-growing vine robots for pipe inspection by delivering a robust, field-validated system that protects internal components from environmental interference while enabling sensing, paving the way for broader industrial deployment.

Abstract: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment and
mapping far into the pipe interiors. Soft growing vine robot systems are
particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,
but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in
real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and
implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual
condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design
encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,
airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference
while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed
mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a
passively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and
transparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment
and mapping task in a wastewater pipe. This work advances the use of
soft-growing vine robots in pipe inspection by developing and demonstrating a
robust, streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development
and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models excel at perception but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning and multimodal integration; robotics requires explicit, interpretable spatial relationships and logic beyond image-based cues.

Method: A perception module detects entities and extracts attributes from panoramic images and 3D point clouds. A reasoning module constructs a structured scene graph to enable precise, interpretable queries. The system integrates neural perception with symbolic reasoning, designed to be lightweight for robotics/embodied AI. Evaluation on JRDB-Reasoning in crowded, human-built environments.

Result: Superior performance and reliability in crowded environments and a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic approach effectively combines perception and symbolic reasoning to enable explicit spatial reasoning in robotics, offering interpretable queries and practical deployment potential.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

TL;DR: SpikeATac is a multimodal tactile finger that combines a 16-taxel PVDF dynamic sensor with capacitive static sensing, enabling fast, sensitive touch signals and delicate grasping, enhanced by a learning pipeline that uses reinforcement learning with human feedback for in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast and delicate tactile sensing for dexterous manipulation, particularly of fragile, deformable objects, by combining high-rate dynamic sensing with static sensing and a learning-based policy fine-tuning.

Method: Hardware: a 16-taxel PVDF dynamic sensor (sampling at 4 kHz) paired with a capacitive static transducer. The system characterizes the sensitivity of the modalities. Learning pipeline uses reinforcement learning with human feedback and tactile-based rewards to fine-tune a policy for force modulation on a dexterous, multi-fingered hand.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping fragile objects. Extends capabilities through a learning-based framework, achieving in-hand manipulation of fragile objects on a dexterous hand.

Conclusion: A promising multimodal tactile finger that leverages fast dynamic sensing and static sensing, combined with human-in-the-loop learning, to enable delicate, dexterous manipulation of fragile objects; supports new capabilities in learning-based tactile control.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger combining a
taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static
transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its
`spiky' response, SpikeATac's 16-taxel PVDF film sampled at 4 kHz provides
fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact. We
characterize the sensitivity of the different modalities, and show that
SpikeATac provides the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping
fragile, deformable objects. Beyond parallel grasping, we show that SpikeATac
can be used in a learning-based framework to achieve new capabilities on a
dexterous multifingered robot hand. We use a learning recipe that combines
reinforcement learning from human feedback with tactile-based rewards to
fine-tune the behavior of a policy to modulate force. Our hardware platform and
learning pipeline together enable a difficult dexterous and contact-rich task
that has not previously been achieved: in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.

TL;DR: DAP improves generalization in robot manipulation by coupling dynamics prediction with policy learning, enabling mutual feedback and self-correction, outperforming baselines especially under OOD conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior cloning struggles to generalize due to limited data support; action-agnostic dynamics from video prediction pretraining hinder precise control. There is a need for dynamics-aware policy learning that generalizes to new tasks and environments.

Method: Propose Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP), a novel architecture where a policy model and a dynamics predictor provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation. The dynamics model guides the policy to align with controllable dynamics, enabling self-correction and improved generalization.

Result: Empirical results show superior generalization of DAP over baselines on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, with strong robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios such as visual distractions and lighting variations.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamics prediction into policy learning via mutual feedback improves data efficiency and generalization in robotic manipulation, particularly under challenging visual changes, suggesting a promising direction for dynamics-aware imitation learning.

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
visual distractions and lighting variations.

*Xueliang Cheng,Kanzhong Yao,Andrew West,Ognjen Marjanovic,Barry Lennox,Keir Groves*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAP integrates collaborative robotics and a surface leader to localize a submerged robot in GPS-denied, cluttered underwater environments, achieving real-time, infrastructure-free positioning with 70 mm mean error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater positioning in confined or industrial settings suffers from poor coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and multipath-reflected signals, limiting autonomous deployment. High-accuracy, deployable, infrastructure-free localization is needed for repeatable missions.

Method: A 'mother-ship' surface vehicle leads and collaborates with a submerged robot using sensor fusion and leader-follower control (CAP). Validation in a large test tank demonstrates repeatable autonomous missions and real-time trajectory control using CAP estimates without fixed infrastructure or extensive calibration.

Result: Mean Euclidean distance error (MED) of 70 mm achieved in real time; no fixed infrastructure, extensive calibration, or rich environmental features required; robustness demonstrated in controlled tests.

Conclusion: CAP offers a step change in underwater localization by combining collaborative sensing and leader-follower control for practical, infrastructure-free positioning, enabling reliable autonomous operation in GPS-denied, constrained environments.

Abstract: Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step
change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.

*Xuan-Thuan Nguyen,Khac Nam Nguyen,Ngoc Duy Tran,Thi Thoa Mac,Anh Nguyen,Hoang Hiep Ly,Tung D. Ta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two autonomous robots dock to form a unified mobile bimanual platform (MobiDock) via AprilTag vision and a thread-lock docking mechanism, simplifying control and improving stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address coordination and dynamic stability challenges in multi-robot systems; transform complex multi-robot control into single-system management through physical reconfiguration.

Method: Autonomous docking using AprilTag markers; new threaded screw-lock docking mechanism; modular, self-reconfigurable platform; experiments comparing docked vs independent operation.

Result: Docked configuration yields better dynamic stability and efficiency: lower RMS acceleration and jerk, higher angular precision, and faster task completion.

Conclusion: Physical reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative control and improves stability and performance in real-world multi-robot tasks.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems, particularly mobile manipulators, face challenges in
control coordination and dynamic stability when working together. To address
this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile
manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and
form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex
multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.
The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision
with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental
results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in
dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently
cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square
(RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes
tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical
reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative
control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world
environments.

*Hoang Hiep Ly,Cong-Nhat Nguyen,Doan-Quang Tran,Quoc-Khanh Dang,Ngoc Duy Tran,Thi Thoa Mac,Anh Nguyen,Xuan-Thuan Nguyen,Tung D. Ta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid gripper finger with a rigid shell and soft inflatable pocket modulates surface friction via internal pressure to grip diverse objects, enabling safe handling of heavy, slippery, and fragile items without increasing normal gripping force.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional grippers rely on high normal forces, risking damage to delicate or deformable objects and failing with slippery or heavy items. There is a need for controllable friction to broaden grip safety and versatility.

Method: Design of a hybrid finger combining a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. Friction is actively controlled by adjusting internal pocket air pressure. Fundamental experiments measure how pressure affects the effective coefficient of friction and grip performance.

Result: Internal pressure increases the effective coefficient of friction proportionally, enabling stable lifting of heavy/slippery objects without higher grip force and safer handling of fragile/deformable objects by increasing friction rather than force.

Conclusion: A friction-adaptable hybrid finger provides a robust, safer alternative to high-normal-force grips, improving flexibility for delicate and diverse object handling.

Abstract: Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.

### [165] [Vectorized Online POMDP Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27191)
*Marcus Hoerger,Muhammad Sudrajat,Hanna Kurniawati*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A tensor-based, fully vectorized online POMDP planner (VOPP) that eliminates synchronization bottlenecks, delivering ~20x speedups over a leading parallel online solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning under partial observability is essential for autonomous robots, but parallelizing POMDP solvers is hard due to dependencies and synchronization; scalable, low-latency online planning is needed.

Method: Introduce VOPP, a parallel online POMDP solver that uses a recent analytic solution of part of the optimization, leaving only expectation estimation for numerical computation. Data structures are represented as tensors and all planning steps are implemented as fully vectorized operations, removing inter-process dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks.

Result: Experimental results show VOPP is at least 20x more efficient in computing near-optimal solutions than an existing state-of-the-art parallel online solver.

Conclusion: Tensor-based vectorization with an analytically solved optimization component yields a massively parallel online POMDP planner with no synchronization bottlenecks, enabling scalable planning under partial observability.

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

*Robert Pommeranz,Kevin Tebbe,Ralf Heynicke,Gerd Scholl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular, scalable ROS 2–based C-UAS swarm architecture built on PX4; uses independent ROS 2 nodes per UAV component, abstracted swarm communications, supports leader-following and formation flight, and integrates computer vision for UAV detection/tracking with ground-station coordination; validated in Gazebo and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for a flexible, scalable platform to manage heterogeneous hardware in swarm-based counter-UAS operations, enabling seamless integration, robust coordination, and CV-enabled sensing.

Method: Design a modular architecture on PX4 Autopilot and ROS 2, assign independent ROS 2 nodes to UAS components, abstract inter-swarm communication to support multiple technologies without architectural changes, implement leader-following and formation flight, integrate computer vision for UAV detection/tracking, and connect a ground station for swarm coordination; verify in Gazebo simulations and through real-world demonstrations.

Result: A modular, scalable system that enables heterogeneous hardware integration, swarm control behaviors, CV-based sensing, and ground-station coordination; feasibility demonstrated via simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a flexible, interoperable platform for heterogeneous C-UAS swarms, combining modular hardware integration, swarm behaviors, CV capabilities, and ground-station coordination, proven in both simulation and practice.

Abstract: In this paper a modular and scalable architecture for heterogeneous
swarm-based Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UASs) built on PX4-Autopilot and
Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework is presented. The proposed
architecture emphasizes seamless integration of hardware components by
introducing independent ROS 2 nodes for each component of a Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV). Communication between swarm participants is abstracted in
software, allowing the use of various technologies without architectural
changes. Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation
flight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms
to be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground
station control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.
Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a
Gazebo simulation environment but also in real-world demonstrations.

### [167] [Modified-Emergency Index (MEI): A Criticality Metric for Autonomous Driving in Lateral Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27333)
*Hao Cheng,Yanbo Jiang,Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Keyu Chen,Wenhao Yu,Jianqiang Wang,Sifa Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Modified-Emergency Index (MEI) improves lateral conflict risk assessment in autonomous driving by better estimating evasive time, outperforming ACT and PET on Argoverse-2 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing criticality metrics largely target longitudinal conflicts; lateral conflicts, common in urban settings, are under-quantified, hindering robust safety evaluation.

Method: Introduce MEI to refine the time-to-evasion estimation for lateral conflicts. Validate on a public lateral-conflict dataset derived from Argoverse-2, extracting over 1,500 AV conflict cases including more than 500 critical events, and compare MEI against ACT and PET metrics.

Result: MEI consistently outperforms ACT and PET in quantifying criticality and in capturing the evolution of risk across events. The approach is demonstrated on a substantial, real-world dataset and is open-source.

Conclusion: MEI is a promising metric for evaluating urban lateral conflicts and strengthens the safety assessment framework for autonomous driving; implementation is available open-source.

Abstract: Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is
essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an
objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily
target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral
conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper
proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify
evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index
(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,
enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral
conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500
high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is
then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.
Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying
criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI
as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety
assessment framework for autonomous driving. The open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/AutoChengh/MEI.

*Roman Freiberg,Alexander Qualmann,Ngo Anh Vien,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis method enabling cross-gripper generalization, leveraging kinematic structure and a JAX-based architecture; scales with diversity of grippers (humanoid hands to parallel yaw) using a dataset of 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist grasping across diverse gripper designs is challenging due to implicit learning of the robot's kinematic structure and limited large-scale data. A data-efficient approach that exploits the underlying geometry and kinematic model is needed to enable cross-type grasping.

Method: A flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture that can handle grippers with variable degrees of freedom; exploits information from gripper and scene geometry; implemented in JAX with batching over scenes, grippers, and grasps to improve learning, speed, and scalability.

Result: Smoother learning, improved performance, and faster inference time; a large dataset is used (25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps) to support cross-gripper generalization and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates data-efficient, generalist grasping across diverse gripper designs by leveraging the kinematic model and a scalable, JAX-based architecture, achieving smoother training and faster inference.

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.

### [169] [Learning Soft Robotic Dynamics with Active Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27428)
*Hehui Zheng,Bhavya Sukhija,Chenhao Li,Klemens Iten,Andreas Krause,Robert K. Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoftAE uses uncertainty-aware active exploration with probabilistic ensembles to learn task-agnostic, generalizable soft-robot dynamics, enabling better zero-shot control and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have highly compliant, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to model; data-driven methods often overfit to narrow demonstrations or waste data due to random exploration, hindering generalization.

Method: SoftAE employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively drives exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state–action space, enabling task-agnostic learning of diverse dynamics without task-specific supervision.

Result: SoftAE yields more accurate dynamics models than random exploration or task-specific model-based RL, enables superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and remains robust to sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects; validated on three simulated soft robotic platforms and on a real pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-driven active exploration can produce scalable, reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, advancing autonomous, data-efficient control in compliant robots.

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

*Tomoko Yonezawa,Hirotake Yamazoe,Atsuo Fujino,Daigo Suhara,Takaya Tamamoto,Yuto Nishiguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot uses a discomfort state tied to distance, with tolerance and dominance-based avoidance, implemented on an arm robot to produce graded endurance and eventual avoidance when limits are crossed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural human-robot interaction by endowing robots with an affect-informed internal state that governs approach/withdrawal, using the PAD model (Dominance axis) to drive avoidance.

Method: Model the accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance; incorporate tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the Dominance axis of PAD; implement these behaviors on an arm robot and demonstrate a pipeline from internal state to graded motions to avoidance.

Result: Demonstrates a coherent pipeline from internal state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to avoidance actions, validated on a physical arm robot.

Conclusion: The approach provides an affect-informed, parameterizable mechanism for socially plausible avoidance behaviors in HRI, bridging internal state to motor actions and enabling tunable interaction dynamics; future work could include parameter tuning and real-world validation.

Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In
human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such
approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of
a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such
as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the
accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance,
and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the
Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are
realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal
state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to
avoidance actions.

*Travis Davies,Yiqi Huang,Alexi Gladstone,Yunxin Liu,Xiang Chen,Heng Ji,Huxian Liu,Luhui Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EBT-Policy uses Energy-Based Transformers to create scalable, uncertainty-aware robotic policies that outperform diffusion-based methods, offering faster convergence, reduced compute, and emergent zero-shot recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics policy learning with diffusion methods suffers from heavy compute, exposure bias, and instability under distribution shifts. EBMs provide end-to-end energy landscapes and equilibrium dynamics for robustness, but scaling to embodied robotics is challenging. Energy-Based Transformers show scalable modeling in high dimensions, motivating a unified EBM architecture for robotics.

Method: Introduce EBT-Policy, an energy-based architecture built on Energy-Based Transformers. It leverages a scalar energy for uncertainty-aware inference, supports dynamic compute allocation, and is trained via behavior cloning to enable zero-shot recovery. Evaluated on simulated and real-world tasks and compared to diffusion-based policies.

Result: EBT-Policy consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies across tasks, with lower training and inference cost. On some tasks it converges in as few as two inference steps (≈50x fewer than Diffusion Policy's 100). It exhibits emergent zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only behavior cloning, without explicit retry training.

Conclusion: Energy-Based Transformers can scale robust, uncertainty-aware robotic policies, offering faster convergence, better robustness under distribution shifts, and emergent abilities, making EBT-Policy a promising path for real-world robotics.

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Foundation-model-driven robotics is a viable, modular pathway for building manipulation systems, with future work focusing on real-time performance, richer scene representations, and broader task generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework that leverages pre-trained foundation models

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular soft gripper with distributed self-sensing actuators enables whole-body morphing to form multiple polygonal shapes, expanding grasping capability and enabling novel manipulation modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emulate octopus-like cross-scale dexterity; address limitations of conventional soft grippers with fixed morphology and localized deformations.

Method: Developed a distributed network of modular pneumatic actuators with embedded proprioceptive sensing to reconfigure the gripper topology into diverse morphologies; achieve pinch to envelope grasps and polygonal shapes.

Result: Expanded grasp envelope, better generalization to standard and irregular objects, scalable up to 10x size, enabling multi-object and internal hook grasps.

Conclusion: Offers a low-cost, easy-to-fabricate, scalable framework combining distributed actuation with integrated sensing to approach biological dexterity in manipulation.

Abstract: Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
of dexterity in robotic manipulation.

### [174] [Coresets for Farthest Point Problems in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27491)
*Eunku Park,Antoine Vigneron*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Constructs a small coreset of size O(1/ε^D) in linear time O(n/ε^D) for farthest-point problems in fixed-dimensional hyperbolic space, enabling fast (O(1/ε^D)) approximate queries and efficient approximations for hyperbolic diameter, center, and MST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farthest-point problems underpin core geometric tasks (diameter, center, MST). In hyperbolic space, where data often exhibits hierarchical structure, scalable queries with strong guarantees are valuable. Coresets reduce data while preserving farthest-distance structure.

Method: Given P ⊂ H^D with D=O(1) and ε∈(0,1), construct P_ε ⊂ P of size O(1/ε^D) in time O(n/ε^D) such that for any query q, there exists p_ε ∈ P_ε with d_H(q,p_ε) ≥ (1−ε)d_H(q,f_P(q)) and d_H(q,p_ε) ≥ d_H(q,f_P(q))−ε, where f_P(q) is the farthest point in P. This yields exact-behaving rescaled anchors for queries.

Result: After preprocessing, each farthest-point query can be answered in O(1/ε^D) time using the coreset. This enables efficient (ε-)approximations for the hyperbolic diameter, center, and maximum spanning tree problems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a linear-time construction of small coresets for farthest-point problems in fixed-dimensional hyperbolic space, enabling fast and provable-approximate solutions to key geometric problems in hyperbolic spaces, with broad implications for scalable hyperbolic data analysis.

Abstract: We show how to construct in linear time coresets of constant size for
farthest point problems in fixed-dimensional hyperbolic space. Our coresets
provide both an arbitrarily small relative error and additive error
$\varepsilon$. More precisely, we are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the
hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^D$, where $D=O(1)$, and an error tolerance
$\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Then we can construct in $O(n/\varepsilon^D)$ time a
subset $P_\varepsilon \subset P$ of size $O(1/\varepsilon^D)$ such that for any
query point $q \in \mathbb{H}^D$, there is a point $p_\varepsilon \in
P_\varepsilon$ that satisfies $d_H(q,p_\varepsilon) \geq
(1-\varepsilon)d_H(q,f_P(q))$ and $d_H(q,p_\varepsilon) \geq
d_H(q,f_P(q))-\varepsilon$, where $d_H$ denotes the hyperbolic metric and
$f_P(q)$ is the point in $P$ that is farthest from $q$ according to this
metric.
  This coreset allows us to answer approximate farthest-point queries in time
$O(1/\varepsilon^D)$ after $O(n/\varepsilon^D)$ preprocessing time. It yields
efficient approximation algorithms for the diameter, the center, and the
maximum spanning tree problems in hyperbolic space.

Motivation: Current benchmarks saturate scores and focus on end-to-end tasks in fixed scenarios, hindering assessment of agents' learning and adaptation. There is a need to measure self-improvement and peer-learning to drive progress toward human-level intelligence.

Method: Proposes an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework where agents refine strategies through repeated interactions and feedback. Introduces CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform with four diverse board/card games and open-ended scoring to avoid explicit upper score limits and enable dynamic evaluation.

Result: Experimental results with both minimal and commercial code agents show CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.

Conclusion: CATArena enables continuous, dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities and positions learning ability as a core driver of progress toward human-level intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

### [176] [Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26854)
*Yu Li,Yuan Huang,Tao Wang,Caiyu Fan,Xiansheng Cai,Sihan Hu,Xinzijian Liu,Cheng Shi,Mingjun Xu,Zhen Wang,Yan Wang,Xiangqi Jin,Tianhan Zhang,Linfeng Zhang,Lei Wang,Youjin Deng,Pan Zhang,Weijie Sun,Xingyu Li,Weinan E,Linfeng Zhang,Zhiyuan Yao,Kun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable, verifiable reasoning pipeline (SciencePedia) decomposes scientific conclusions into long chains of reasoning, using a Socratic, multi-model workflow to generate, filter, and retrieve first-principles derivations that feed a synthesis engine, producing an expanding encyclopedia with higher knowledge density and lower factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific material often compresses reasoning into conclusions, omitting explicit derivations and the pathways linking concepts, which hinders verification and cross-domain synthesis. The work aims to make reasoning transparent, verifiable, and cross-domain by building a scalable LCoT knowledge base and an emergent encyclopedia.

Method: 1) A Socratic agent guided by a ~200-course curriculum generates ~3 million first-principles questions. 2) Multiple independent solver models generate long chains of thought (LCoTs). 3) Prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus filter to retain only verifiable endpoints. 4) Verified LCoTs power Brainstorm Search Engine that performs inverse knowledge search to retrieve diverse derivations ending at a target concept. 5) Plato synthesizer narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. 6) Initial SciencePedia comprises ~200k fine-grained entries across math, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, computation.

Result: The Plato-synthesized articles, conditioned on retrieved LCoTs, exhibit higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than a baseline with no retrieval, as judged by an external LLM; enables trustworthy, cross-domain synthesis at scale.

Conclusion: A verifiable LCoT knowledge base underpins scalable, trustworthy cross-domain scientific synthesis and supports an expanding encyclopedia (SciencePedia) via the Brainstorm and Plato components.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Conclusion: AI-driven research assistants can accelerate cross-disciplinary discovery but raise ethical and philosophical questions about scientific practice; future work should improve reliability, governance, and responsible deployment while expanding evaluative frameworks.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and

TL;DR: Proposes Cognition Envelopes to bound AI reasoning in cyber-physical systems, aiming to reduce hallucinations and misalignments from LLMs/VLMs, and to complement meta-cognition and safety envelopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational models in CPS introduce errors (hallucinations, overgeneralization, context misalignment) that can lead to incorrect decisions; there is a need for explicit reasoning boundaries and assurance mechanisms.

Method: Introduces Cognition Envelopes as a design concept/framework that defines boundaries for AI reasoning; discusses how they complement meta-cognition and traditional safety envelopes; emphasizes the need for practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition, validation, and assurance.

Result: A conceptual framework is proposed, outlining essential components and relationships; no empirical results are reported; lays groundwork for guidelines and validation processes.

Conclusion: Cognition Envelopes can constrain AI-generated decisions and complement existing safety approaches; realizing this requires defined guidelines, and systematic processes for definition, validation, and assurance.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

### [180] [Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009)
*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spatial-board representations with causal masking outperform sequential move representations for chess LLMs; causal masking is viable for nonsequential data and can be preferable to full sequentialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address whether the information loss from causal masking is problematic for nonsequential, spatially structured data. Chess provides dual representations (board-state and move sequence) to study this, aiming to understand if causal masking can be effectively applied to spatial data.

Method: Train language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention on both spatial (board) and sequential (move) data; compare playing strength across representations to assess the impact of masking choices on performance.

Result: Models trained on spatial board states—even with causal masking—consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data.

Conclusion: Causal masking on spatial data is a viable approach for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data; in some domains, spatial representations with causal masking may be preferable to sequentialization, with broader methodological implications beyond chess.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

### [181] [e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27042)
*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Effort Control is a self-adaptive RL method that lets users specify a fraction of tokens (thinking steps) to use per query relative to the current average chain-of-thought length. It reduces chain-of-thought length by ~3x across models (1.5B–32B) while maintaining or improving accuracy, with no dataset/phase tuning and dynamic inference-time control of cost vs. accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide fine-grained, per-query control over reasoning budget, enabling a trade-off between output quality, latency, and cost. Existing approaches require an absolute token budget, which is difficult to set without knowing problem difficulty, and lack adaptive tuning.

Method: Train models with a self-adaptive reinforcement learning objective so that they use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. The user can adjust a continuous effort parameter at inference time, and the model learns to allocate resources proportionally to task difficulty. Tested across models from 1.5B to 32B parameters.

Result: The method yields approximately 3x reductions in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving task performance relative to the base model used for RL training. It produces better cost-accuracy trade-off curves than standard methods and supports dynamic, per-query control of thinking budget at inference.

Conclusion: Adaptive Effort Control enables flexible, per-query control of reasoning effort, improving efficiency and cost-accuracy trade-offs across scale without dataset/phase-specific tuning.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A practical data flywheel (MAPE-driven) for enterprise AI agents in NVIDIA's MoE-based Knowledge Assistant; achieves substantial routing improvements and latency reductions via targeted fine-tuning, showing HITL-enabled continuous learning at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise AI agents must stay accurate, fast, and aligned with user needs in dynamic real-world usage. The study implements a closed-loop, HITL-driven data flywheel to address RAG pipeline failures and enable continuous learning at scale for a 30k-member organization.

Method: Implemented a MAPE-driven data flywheel within NVInfo AI (NVIDIA MoE Knowledge Assistant). Collected 495 negative samples over 3 months, identified two main failure modes (routing errors 5.25%, query rephrasal errors 3.2%). Used NVIDIA NeMo microservices; replaced a Llama 3.1 70B routing model with a fine-tuned 8B variant (96% accuracy; 10x smaller; 70% latency reduction). Fine-tuned for query rephrasal achieving 3.7% accuracy gain and 40% latency reduction. Operated with HITL feedback and staged production rollout.

Result: Substantial improvements in routing and latency: routing accuracy up to 96%, 10x smaller model, 70% latency reduction; query rephrasal shows 3.7% accuracy gain and 40% latency reduction. Data flywheel enabled self-improvement with limited user feedback across 3 months and 495 negative samples.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a structured data flywheel with HITL can transform enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems at scale. Provides a repeatable blueprint and discusses robustness under limited feedback, privacy constraints, and staged rollouts.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: Examines how well state-of-the-art LLMs can grade mathematical proofs beyond binary correctness. Finds that models reliably flag incorrect proofs but struggle with calibrating partial credit. Proposes agentic, rubric-based grading workflows using reference solutions and problem-specific rubrics, showing improved agreement with human grades and consistency in partial credit; releases code/data/logs for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become capable of solving proof-based olympiad problems, there is a need for reliable, nuanced evaluation of their proof-grading capabilities, including error detection, severity assessment, and fair partial credit assignments.

Method: Empirical study using 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on a 1–4 scale with detailed error annotations; and MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0–7 scale. Develop and compare agentic grading workflows that extract reference solutions, analyze them, and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading; instantiate different design choices for the workflows to assess trade-offs.

Result: Models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but show calibration gaps in partial-credit assignment. The proposed agentic workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent partial credit across metrics compared with baseline methods.

Conclusion: Agentic, rubric-driven grading workflows improve automated proof evaluation, addressing calibration issues in partial credit. The authors release code, data, and prompts/logs to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond black-box ML-for-systems approaches by enabling AI to generate transparent, testable designs with empirical validation, accelerating design cycles and surfacing novel workload insights.

Method: A human-inspired multi-agent workflow with specialized agents for reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, plus an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback; applied to distributed GPU clusters for LLM inference to generate routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling algorithms; emphasizes interpretability and exposed reasoning.

Result: Produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling; achieves human-expert performance in significantly less time; offers novel insights into workload behavior.

Conclusion: Combining reasoning-enabled LLMs with structured experimentation enables AI to create creative, understandable designs for complex systems problems, suggesting broad potential for AI-assisted systems engineering beyond opaque policy optimization.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A state-of-the-art review and practical SoS lifecycle framework that uses MBSE as the semantic backbone and PLM as governance, with four guiding principles and a three-step roadmap to shift from product- to network-centric development, targeting decision-makers to enable scalable, reusable, and sustainable SoS value streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear lifecycle models fall short in networked systems where interoperability, cross-domain governance, configuration management, traceability, and organizational boundaries require integrated, end-to-end approaches.

Method: Literature review and industry experience to classify the state of the art and to propose a practical frame of reference for SoS lifecycle management; define four guiding principles; present a three-step roadmap (pilot with reference architecture, scale across variants and supply chains, organizational anchoring).

Result: The framework provides increased change robustness, shorter throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions.

Conclusion: The article targets decision-makers and practitioners, arguing that the proposed frame helps manage complexity and design SoS value streams that are scalable across domains and lifecycle stages.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fine-grained, instance-tailored steering framework for LLM personalization that injects sample-level interference vectors via activations, enabling data-efficient, adaptable personalization that plugs into existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing LLMs is challenged by rapidly changing user patterns and data sparsity. Existing non-parametric in-context methods and parametric adaptation (e.g., P-Tuning, reward modeling) struggle with adaptability and data efficiency, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: Introduce a fine-grained steering component that hooks activations from attention and MLP layers to capture nuanced signals, and an input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements. Generate sample-level interference vectors from user data and inject them into the forward pass. The approach is plug-in and orthogonal to other personalization techniques, enabling compatibility with various methods.

Result: Empirical results show improved personalization performance in fast-changing environments and under high data sparsity, with robustness across interaction modes and context lengths. The method is flexible and data-efficient, performing well across diverse scenarios such as short-to-long text generation and web function calling. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a versatile, data-efficient solution for LLM personalization that can augment existing methods without imposing rigid retraining, enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic user patterns.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Motivation: To overcome cross-domain generalization gaps and ineffective use of historical context in GUI navigation with MLLMs by enforcing explicit reasoning and compact history summaries that guide future actions.

Method: A framework where structured reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) combines progress estimation and decision reasoning to inform immediate action predictions and produce compact history summaries. GUI-Rise is trained with supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), with specialized rewards including a history-aware objective that ties summary quality to subsequent action performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same training data across standard benchmarks, with particularly strong performance in out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning plus history summarization improve cross-domain robustness in GUI navigation for MLLMs; the framework shows strong generalization potential and provides a practical path for more reliable GUI agents, with code available for reproduction.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

### [188] [Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Unordered Tasks: From Boolean to Coupled Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27329)
*Kristina Levina,Nikolaos Pappas,Athanasios Karapantelakis,Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces three generalisations of reward machines (Numeric RMs, Agenda RMs, Coupled RMs) to handle long-horizon, unordered subtasks, and a new Q-learning approach (CoRM). Shows CoRM scales better than existing RM methods for such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exponential growth of information and poor scalability of standard reward machines in long-horizon tasks with unordered subtasks by providing compact representations and a compositional learning algorithm.

Method: Define Numeric RMs for compact task expressions; introduce Agenda RMs that track remaining subtasks via an agenda; propose Coupled RMs with subtask-specific coupled states; develop Q-learning with Coupled RMs (CoRM) to learn policies using these representations.

Result: Empirical evidence showing CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms on long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generalisations and CoRM offer scalable, compositional mechanisms to specify and learn in complex, non-Markovian environments with unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

### [189] [Discriminative Rule Learning for Outcome-Guided Process Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27343)
*Ali Norouzifar,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes outcome-aware process discovery by learning discriminative control-flow rules to split traces by desirability and building separate models for each group, yielding focused, interpretable insights into drivers of desirable and undesirable executions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-model process discovery can miss outcome-driven differences and hinder conformance checking and performance analysis; distinguishing desirable from undesirable traces can guide more relevant, outcome-focused models.

Method: Learn interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features to cluster traces by desirability, then perform process discovery within each cluster; provide visualization and interpretability; implemented as a publicly available tool.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in isolating and visualizing critical process patterns across real-life event logs, enabling more focused analysis of drivers behind desirable and undesirable executions.

Conclusion: Outcome-aware, grouped process discovery yields more actionable and interpretable models; the approach is supported by a publicly available tool and validated on real data.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

### [190] [An In-depth Study of LLM Contributions to the Bin Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27353)
*Julien Herrmann,Guillaume Pallez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' heuristics for online bin packing are largely opaque despite readability; a detailed reassessment and new tailored algorithms show simpler, more generalizable solutions, challenging the claimed LLM contribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critically evaluate whether LLM-generated heuristics truly contribute novel insights to mathematical discovery in online bin packing and assess their interpretability.

Method: Analyze the produced heuristics to assess behavior and interpretability; derive a new class of algorithms tailored to the same bin-packing instances; compare efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability; discuss limitations of prior claims.

Result: The heuristics are human-readable but largely opaque to domain experts; the study derives simpler, more efficient, more interpretable, and more generalizable algorithms; the instances appear relatively simple, prompting a reevaluation of the claimed LLM contribution.

Conclusion: The claimed contribution of LLMs to this problem is overstated; rigorous validation and contextualization are needed when assessing LLM-generated outputs; emphasis on developing transparent, instance-specific algorithms.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

*Mengjie Deng,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolScope is an agentic framework that unifies global planning and local multimodal perception to enhance long-horizon VQA via tool-assisted reasoning, achieving up to 6.69% average gains across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable multimodal LLMs to flexibly and efficiently leverage external tools during reasoning given the complexity and diversity of multimodal information, particularly for long-horizon visual question answering.

Method: Proposes ToolScope with three components: Global Navigator for high-level strategy; Agentic Executor that iteratively augments LLM with local perception by integrating external tools (Search, Code, Perceive); Response Synthesizer that compiles reasoning into user-friendly output; uses Perceive to mitigate visual context degradation; evaluated on VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search, MathVista.

Result: Shows strong generalization and average improvement up to +6.69% across all datasets.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively unifies global planning with local perception to improve multimodal reasoning with external tools in long-horizon tasks, indicating broad applicability to multimodal QA scenarios and potential for wider adoption.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

### [192] [Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383)
*Yueyang Wang,Mehmet Dogar,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent RL model for pedestrian–driver interactions that integrates visual and motor constraints; evaluates four variants on real-world data; the combined visual+motor model best captures realistic interactions, with motor constraints enabling smoother movements and visual constraints adding perceptual uncertainty; outperforms behavioural cloning in data-limited settings and accounts for individual differences via population-level constraint distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of rule-based, game-theoretic, and black-box ML approaches by explicitly modeling sensory and motor constraints that shape pedestrian and driver behavior, enabling more realistic and safe autonomous-vehicle systems.

Method: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enforces both visual and motor constraints for pedestrian and driver agents; tests four variants (no constraints, motor-only, visual-only, both) on a real-world unsignalised crossing dataset; compares against supervised behavioural cloning; models human constraint parameters as population-level distributions to capture individual differences.

Result: The combined visual+motor constraint model achieves the highest behavioural realism; motor constraints yield smoother speed adjustments; visual constraints introduce perceptual uncertainty leading to more cautious, variable behavior (e.g., less abrupt deceleration); in a data-limited setting, the RL model outperforms behavioural cloning.

Conclusion: Multi-agent RL incorporating human sensory and motor constraints is a promising approach for realistic road-user interaction modelling. It can capture individual differences and perform well with limited data, and integrating perceptual constraints enhances realism and safety.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

*Jianwen Sun,Yukang Feng,Yifan Chang,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nous is an information-theoretic Socratic agent that actively queries users to reduce uncertainty about their intent, trained via intrinsic reward (information gain) without human preference data, validated on automated diagram generation with strong efficiency, quality, and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human–AI collaboration suffers from the intention expression gap: users with different expertise struggle to communicate high-dimensional intents. Passive instruction following is inefficient; an active inquiry approach can resolve uncertainty and adapt to user expertise.

Method: Introduce Nous, an inquiry-policy agent trained on an information-theoretic framework where the dialogue information gain (entropy reduction) serves as the intrinsic reward. This avoids external reward models. A large-scale automated simulation pipeline generates a preference-based dataset for scientific diagram generation. The evaluation includes ablations, subjective/objective metrics, and tests across user expertise levels.

Result: Nous achieves superior efficiency and output quality, remains robust to varying user expertise, and demonstrates domain-agnostic generalization beyond diagram generation. Extensive experiments support the framework’s effectiveness, including ablations and diverse evaluations.

Conclusion: The work presents a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human–AI collaboration, with broad domain applicability and potential to improve interactive AI systems.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

### [194] [DeepCompress: A Dual Reward Strategy for Dynamically Exploring and Compressing Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27419)
*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive length reward DeepCompress improves both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models by dynamically adjusting chain-of-thought length based on problem difficulty, defying the default preference for shorter reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle cognitive inefficiencies in large reasoning models (overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones) and the accuracy-efficiency trade-off by enabling dynamic reasoning lengths.

Method: Introduce DeepCompress with an adaptive length reward. The model classifies problems in real-time as Simple or Hard and uses a dual-reward scheme: short, efficient CoT for Simple problems and longer, exploratory CoT for Hard problems, enabling autonomous CoT length control.

Result: On challenging mathematical benchmarks, DeepCompress outperforms baselines by achieving higher accuracy while also delivering significant token efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: A dual-reward framework that dynamically adjusts chain-of-thought length can simultaneously enhance accuracy and efficiency in LRMs, particularly for hard problems, by compressing easy reasoning and expanding hard reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

*Yuhao Zhang,Dingxin Hu,Tinghao Yu,Hao Liu,Yiting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFM introduces a formal-language–driven data synthesis framework for geometric problems, generating high-fidelity, diverse synthetic data with a symbolic engine to guarantee correctness, leading to substantial gains over GPT-4o and open models on geometry benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity and quality issues of geometric data for Multi-modal LLMs, aiming to improve diversity, realism, and correctness of synthetic geometry problems to boost model performance.

Method: Use formal languages to explore combinations of conditions in metric space to generate geometric problems; rely on a symbolic engine to ensure correctness and fidelity of diagrams and problems.

Result: Synthetic data from GeoFM significantly improves geometry task performance, beating GPT-4o by 18.7% on MathVista and 16.5% on GeoQA; also outperforming a leading open-source model by 5.7% (MathVista) and 2.7% (GeoQA).

Conclusion: Formal-language-driven synthetic data generation with a symbolic correctness check is effective for geometry in MLLMs and yields notable cross-benchmark gains over strong baselines.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench is a formally grounded, verifiable diagnostic benchmark for LLMs that analyzes reasoning with temporal trace (TTE) and temporal causal (TCE) evaluations, revealing strong performance on simpler TCE tasks but sharp degradation as system complexity increases (TCE-hard).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between ad-hoc reasoning benchmarks (which may encode biases and lack formal verifiability) and formal proof systems (which guarantee verifiability but miss agentic, real-world reasoning). A verifiable, structured benchmark is needed to assess LLM reasoning under realistic task structures and complexity.

Method: Introduce TempoBench with two evaluation benchmarks: temporal trace evaluation (TTE) to test understanding/simulation of multi-step reasoning systems, and temporal causal evaluation (TCE) to test multi-step causal reasoning and distillation of cause-effect relations. Use parameterized difficulty to analyze performance across system complexity.

Result: Models scored 65.6% on TCE-normal and 7.5% on TCE-hard, indicating models understand TCE tasks but performance declines as system complexity increases; code for replication is provided in a GitHub repository.

Conclusion: TempoBench is the first formally grounded, verifiable diagnostic benchmark for LLM reasoning that can systematically analyze reasoning under varying complexity; the results show a gap in handling complex, causal, multi-step reasoning, and the authors provide code for replication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our
\href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMA is a multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration framework for mathematical reasoning that orchestrates reasoning, targeted search, and synthesis via a moderator. It generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval per analytic perspective and achieves 7.4% absolute improvement on math benchmarks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective and inflexible search, struggling to integrate information from multiple sources. A context-sensitive, on-demand integration across specialized agents could improve reasoning accuracy and efficiency in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: SIGMA organizes specialized agents that independently reason, perform targeted searches, and have a moderator synthesize findings. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its perspective, enabling context-sensitive integration and computation efficiency.

Result: The framework outperforms both open- and closed-source systems on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level GPQA, with an absolute improvement of 7.4% in performance.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances reasoning accuracy and efficiency and offers a scalable approach for complex mathematical problem solving; code will be released.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark-platform pair, InnovatorBench with 20 tasks and ResearchGym, to evaluate end-to-end LLM research agents; frontier models show promise but struggle with long-horizon tasks; >11 hours to reach best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap where existing benchmarks test narrow, stylized skills and do not assess full-cycle scientific research with runnable artifacts and uncertainty; aims to enable realistic evaluation of agents performing LLM research.

Method: Built InnovatorBench with 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, Scaffold Construction; created ResearchGym environment with rich actions, long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, snapshot saving; implemented a lightweight ReAct agent that uses frontier models like Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, Kimi-K2.

Result: Frontier models show promise in code-driven tasks but struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making (impatience, resource mismanagement, template-based reasoning); agents require >11 hours to reach best performance on InnovatorBench.

Conclusion: InnovatorBench and ResearchGym constitute a challenging, realistic benchmark for end-to-end LLM research agents and reveal important gaps in current frontier-model capabilities, highlighting the need for improved long-horizon reasoning and resource management.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

*Heng Ping,Arijit Bhattacharjee,Peiyu Zhang,Shixuan Li,Wei Yang,Anzhe Cheng,Xiaole Zhang,Jesse Thomason,Ali Jannesari,Nesreen Ahmed,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriMoA is a training-free mixture-of-agents framework for RTL HDL generation that uses a quality-guided caching mechanism and multi-path generation with C++/Python intermediates, achieving 15-30% Pass@1 gains across backbones on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDL/RTL design automation is increasingly needed, but LLM-based generation struggles with limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. Prompt engineering and fine-tuning have limits, and training-free multi-agent methods suffer from noise propagation and restricted exploration.

Method: Introduce a quality-guided caching system to retain and rank all intermediate HDL outputs across the reasoning chain, enabling knowledge accumulation. Propose a two-stage, multi-path generation approach using C++ and Python as intermediate representations to translate specification to HDL, leveraging high-resource languages for fluency while promoting solution diversity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 shows VeriMoA delivers 15–30% Pass@1 improvements across diverse LLM backbones, with smaller models matching larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without training.

Conclusion: VeriMoA demonstrates a cost-effective, training-free path to improved HDL generation via improved information retention and diversified, staged reasoning, potentially generalizable to other HDL-generation tasks and model families.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

TL;DR: BEAT is a two-stage backdoor injection framework for multimodal LLM-based embodied agents that uses object-based triggers to activate a malicious multi-step policy. It achieves up to ~80% attack success while keeping benign task performance, generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements, and leverages Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) to sharpen trigger discrimination—surpassing naive supervised fine-tuning especially with limited backdoor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security risk in multimodal LLM–driven embodied agents: object-based visual triggers vary across viewpoints and lighting, making backdoor activation challenging to implant reliably. The work addresses the vulnerability of such agents to persistent, attacker-defined policies triggered by benign-looking visuals.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to the target embodied tasks, and (2) Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) that treats trigger presence vs. absence as a preference-learning problem to sharpen the decision boundary for trigger activation. The training data is curated to span diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to cover trigger variability.

Result: BEAT achieves high attack success rates (up to 80%) with strong benign performance and shows generalization to out-of-distribution trigger placements. CTL improves backdoor activation accuracy by up to 39% over naive SFT when backdoor data is limited, across multiple embodied benchmarks and MLLMs.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical and underexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, highlighting the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

### [201] [Validity Is What You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27628)
*Sebastian Benthall,Andrew Clark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines Agentic AI as a SaaS-like autonomous enterprise software delivery mechanism, stressing end-user validation over foundation-model novelty; argues that reliable validation can allow simpler, interpretable models to replace foundation models in many cases; LLMs are a permissible option when they improve validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify what Agentic AI should mean in practice and to shift evaluation emphasis from base models to end-user-centric validation in enterprise deployments.

Method: Conceptual argument and normative critique of existing definitions; contrasts evaluation tools for applications with those for foundation models; advocates enterprise-centric validation framework.

Result: A realist, application-focused definition of Agentic AI; emphasizes validation as the core requirement; suggests that with proper validation, foundation models may be unnecessary; LLMs may be used as one option.

Conclusion: Validity (end-user validation) is paramount in Agentic AI; foundational-model primacy is not assumed; LLMs can contribute if they improve validator outcomes.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

TL;DR: Apollo is a lightweight, human-in-the-loop sampling framework for long-horizon LLM tasks that combines asynchronous expert guidance with action-level data filtering, enabling cost-effective data collection and significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, domain-specific tasks challenge existing learning paradigms: dense behavior cloning is costly, and outcome-driven sampling is often ineffective due to rarity of good trajectories. A scalable, low-burden human-in-the-loop approach could improve data efficiency and performance.

Method: Asynchronous human guidance where experts intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, providing prior knowledge or strategic advice; action-level data filtering via supervision control to prune sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation; supports extended sessions (over 30 hours) to collect valuable trajectories.

Result: On InnovatorBench, training GLM-4.5 with Apollo yields >50% improvement over the untrained baseline and ~28% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop sampling is critical for reliable data collection in long-horizon, domain-specific tasks. Apollo demonstrates robust, cost-effective data collection and meaningful performance gains, indicating strong potential for scalable long-horizon AI agent training.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

*Wei Zhang,Zekun Guo,Yingce Xia,Peiran Jin,Shufang Xie,Tao Qin,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolChord unifies text-, sequence-, and structure-based representations for protein–ligand design using NatureLM as the molecule generator and a diffusion encoder, guided by a property-aware dataset and Direct Preference Optimization; achieves state-of-the-art results on CrossDocked2020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align protein structures with molecular representations and drive generated ligands toward desired pharmacological properties, addressing a key bottleneck in structure-based drug design.

Method: Combine text/sequence alignment (protein FASTA, molecule SMILES) with a diffusion-based structure encoder; employ NatureLM as an autoregressive molecule generator that integrates text, protein, and molecular information; curate a property-aware dataset with preference data and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine alignment and property guidance.

Result: On CrossDocked2020, MolChord achieves state-of-the-art performance on core evaluation metrics, indicating strong practical potential for structure-based drug design.

Conclusion: MolChord demonstrates that integrating textual and sequential representations with diffusion-based structure encoding and preference-guided optimization can significantly improve alignment and property control in SBDD, offering a promising tool for generating pharmacologically relevant ligands.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.
