However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mini-o3 scales tool-based interactions to tens of turns for deep multi-turn visual reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art on difficult visual search tasks via the Visual Probe Dataset, an iterative cold-start data-collection pipeline, and an over-turn masking strategy.", "motivation": "Open-source image-based tools with reinforcement learning often exhibit monotonous reasoning and support only a limited number of interactions, which fails on tasks requiring trial-and-error exploration.
