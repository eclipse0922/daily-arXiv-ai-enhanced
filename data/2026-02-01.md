### [1] [Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911)
*Haochen Zhang,Animesh Sinha,Felix Juefei-Xu,Haoyu Ma,Kunpeng Li,Zhipeng Fan,Meng Dong,Xiaoliang Dai,Tingbo Hou,Peizhao Zhang,Zecheng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Formalizes non-Markov multi-round image generation and shows that history-aware training, data construction, and a detokenizer/ curriculum improve multi-turn consistency and instruction compliance while preserving single-turn editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLM systems for multi-turn interactions largely rely on short-range (Markov) context, causing degraded performance when users reference earlier states or undo changes. A non-Markov framework is needed to robustly model long-range history in interactive image generation.

Method: (i) Non-Markov data construction strategies: rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states; name-based multi-round personalization binding names to appearances across rounds. (ii) History-conditioned training/inference with token-level caching to prevent identity drift. (iii) Reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum to boost reconstruction fidelity and editable personalization.

Result: Training explicitly for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

Conclusion: Explicitly training for non-Markov, history-aware interactions yields robust, high-fidelity, editable image generation across multiple rounds and can generalize beyond single-turn tasks.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

### [2] [Text controllable PET denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20990)
*Xuehua Ye,Hongxu Yang,Adam J. Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-conditioned U-Net denoiser for PET that uses text guidance to improve denoising across multiple count levels with a single model, aiming to preserve diagnostic features while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET noise from low counts and acquisition variability degrades diagnostic information; a single, text-guided model could provide robust, controllable denoising potentially enabling shorter scans.

Method: A U-Net based denoiser conditioned on features from a pretrained CLIP model, guided by text prompts to steer denoising; designed to operate across a wide range of PET count levels with a single trained model.

Result: Claims significant improvements in qualitative (visual quality) and quantitative (metrics?) assessments; suggests potential for enabling faster scans or handling diverse denoising demands.

Conclusion: Text-guided, CLIP-enabled denoising for PET shows promise for robust, adaptable noise reduction across varying acquisition conditions, but requires detailed validation across scanners, protocols, and clinical tasks.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

### [3] [Low performing pixel correction in computed tomography with unrolled network and synthetic data training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20995)
*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unrolled dual-domain network to correct LPP artifacts in CT using synthetic data, bridging sinogram and image domains via forward-model correlations; no real clinical data required; robust to scanner settings; outperforms state-of-the-art with 1-2% defects near isocenter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-performance pixels in CT detectors cause ring/streak artifacts, which current corrections either operate in image space or sinogram space and require labeled real data. There is a need for data-efficient, cross-domain approaches that exploit the CT forward model to link sinogram and image representations.

Method: An unrolled network that alternates between sinogram and image domains (dual-domain) with data-consistency steps guided by the CT forward model. Training uses synthetic data generated from natural images to simulate LPP in both domains, enabling learning of cross-domain correlations without real clinical data.

Result: In simulations with 1-2% detector defects near the isocenter, the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It demonstrates strong artifact correction capability and robustness, suggesting adaptability to different scanner settings.

Conclusion: The proposed unrolled dual-domain method effectively corrects LPP artifacts without real-world training data, leveraging forward-model correlations via synthetic data and showing potential for software-based, scanner-agnostic correction.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

### [4] [AI-based Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence from Biopsy and Prostatectomy Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21022)
*Andrea Camilloni,Chiara Micoli,Nita Mulliqi,Erik Everett Palm,Thorgerdur Palsdottir,Kelvin Szolnoky,Xiaoyi Ji,Sol Erika Boman,Andrea Discacciati,Henrik Grönberg,Lars Egevad,Tobias Nordström,Kimmo Kartasalo,Martin Eklund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based histopathology model trained on diagnostic biopsy slides predicts 5-year BCR risk after radical prostatectomy and generalizes to external RP cohorts, providing incremental prognostic value beyond CAPRA-S; the added benefit of AI-based multimodal approaches requires further validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prognostic tools for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy remain imprecise; leveraging biopsy-based histopathology with AI could improve patient-specific risk stratification and inform preoperative and postoperative decisions.

Method: Train on diagnostic biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n=676) using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Validate externally on LEOPARD (n=508), CHIMERA (n=95), and TCGA-PRAD (n=379). Assess 5-year time-dependent AUCs (0.64, 0.70, 0.70). Integrate clinical variables to evaluate additive prognostic value and compare against CAPRA-S.

Result: 5-year time-dependent AUCs: 0.64 (LEOPARD), 0.70 (CHIMERA), 0.70 (TCGA-PRAD). Incorporating clinical data provided complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. AI offered incremental prognostic improvement over CAPRA-S.

Conclusion: Biopsy-trained histopathology AI demonstrates generalizability across specimen types and can aid both preoperative and postoperative decision making. However, the incremental value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler models should be critically evaluated in future studies.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

### [5] [BadDet+: Robust Backdoor Attacks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21066)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadDet+ unifies RMA and ODA into a log-barrier–based backdoor for object detectors, achieving robust, physically transferable attacks with minimal impact on clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection backdoors are under-studied compared to image classification, with existing detection-based attacks relying on unrealistic assumptions and lacking physical validation; a framework with better transferability and physical robustness is needed.

Method: BadDet+ uses a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, unifying Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). It yields position/scale invariance and improved physical robustness, supported by a theoretical analysis that the attack operates in a trigger-specific feature subspace. Empirical evaluation shows superior synthetic-to-physical transfer and preservation of clean performance.

Result: Superior synthetic-to-physical transfer on real-world benchmarks compared with RMA and ODA baselines, while maintaining clean accuracy and providing theoretical guarantees about subspace confinement of the attack.

Conclusion: The work highlights serious vulnerabilities in object detection models and the need for specialized defenses; BadDet+ provides a unified, penalty-based framework for evaluating and understanding robust, transferable backdoors in detection systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [6] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionVLM mitigates modality bias in Temporal Action Localization by keeping vision as the dominant signal and adaptively incorporating language via a debiasing reweighting module and a residual aggregation strategy, achieving up to 3.2% mAP gain on THUMOS14.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In TAL, vision-language models can over-rely on linguistic priors, degrading visual performance. There is a need to balance modalities to improve temporal localization without overconfident linguistic cues.

Method: Introduce a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the incremental language advantage over vision-only predictions and dynamically reweights the language stream; use a residual aggregation strategy where language refines rather than drives predictions.

Result: On THUMOS14, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.2% improvement in mAP over prior methods.

Conclusion: The approach reduces modality bias and linguistic overconfidence, strengthens temporal reasoning, and demonstrates that selective language integration can boost TAL performance.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

### [7] [Shape of Thought: Progressive Object Assembly via Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21081)
*Yu Huo,Siyu Zhang,Kun Zeng,Haoyue Liu,Owen Lee,Junlin Chen,Yuquan Lu,Yifu Guo,Yaodong Liang,Xiaoying Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoT introduces a visual chain-of-thought framework for multimodal text-to-image generation, enabling progressive shape assembly via 2D projections, with a new Shape-of-Thought model, SoT-26K dataset, and T2S-CompBench benchmark; it improves structural compositionality (numeracy and topology) and provides transparent process supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal generative models struggle with compositional structure constraints (e.g., numeracy, attribute binding, part-level relations). A method that couples planning with intermediate renderings can capture shape-assembly logic without explicit geometric outputs, enabling more reliable, interpretable compositional generation.

Method: Train a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states. Use progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections, avoiding external engines at inference. Build SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces from part-based CAD hierarchies. Introduce T2S-CompBench to evaluate structural integrity and trace faithfulness.

Result: Fine-tuning on SoT-26K yields 88.4% component numeracy and 84.8% structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by ~20%. These results indicate improved compositional understanding and trace faithfulness.

Conclusion: SoT establishes a new, transparent, process-supervised paradigm for compositional generation in multimodal models. It integrates planning with intermediate rendering to capture shape-assembly logic; code is available, and the SoT-26K dataset will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

### [8] [An AI Framework for Microanastomosis Motion Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21120)
*Yan Meng,Eduardo J. Torres-Rodríguez,Marcelle Altshuler,Nishanth Gowda,Arhum Naeem,Recai Yilmaz,Omar Arnaout,Daniel A. Donoho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI-based framework for automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling using YOLO, DeepSORT, shape descriptors, and a supervised classifier; achieves high instrument detection precision (97%) and mAP (96%) across IoU 50-95.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjectivity, inter-rater variability, and lack of standardized criteria hinder reliable assessment of microsurgical performance. A objective, scalable evaluation framework is needed.

Method: Integrated four-component pipeline: (1) YOLO-based instrument detection; (2) DeepSORT-based instrument tracking; (3) instrument tip localization via shape descriptors; (4) supervised classifier trained on expert-labeled data to judge instrument handling proficiency.

Result: Instrument detection precision 97% and mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96% across IoU thresholds from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective, objective, and scalable assessment of microsurgical instrument handling, enabling standardized evaluation and potential improvements in training and certification.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

### [9] [Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21159)
*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDCI: a training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for high-resolution remote sensing that integrates cross-model attention fusion, bidirectional cross-graph diffusion, and convex-optimization-based superpixel collaboration to improve localization and boundary refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate, training-free OVSS in high-resolution remote sensing where objects are densely distributed and have complex boundaries. Existing training-free approaches rely on one-way CLIP/VFM fusion and shallow post-processing, which limits geometric localization and semantic prediction.

Method: SDCI comprises three modules: (1) CAF for cross-model attention fusion by injecting self-attention maps between CLIP and vision foundation models during feature encoding; (2) BCDR for iterative random-walk diffusion to refine dual-branch segmentation scores via bidirectional diffusion on a cross-graph; (3) CSCP, a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction, leveraging low-level superpixel structures to refine object boundaries. The approach is training-free and combines dual-branch inference with traditional superpixel cues.

Result: Empirical results on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks show that SDCI outperforms existing training-free OVSS methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the continued effectiveness of traditional superpixel-based object analysis within deep learning frameworks.

Conclusion: SDCI effectively enhances training-free OVSS for high-resolution remote sensing by enabling (i) cross-model attention-guided collaboration, (ii) reliable diffusion-based score refinement, and (iii) superpixel-guided boundary refinement, indicating a beneficial integration of traditional image analysis with modern deep learning in a training-free setting.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

*Yuji Lin,Qian Zhao,Zongsheng Yue,Junhui Hou,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDiff-LF introduces a diffusion-based framework for underwater 4-D light field enhancement, leveraging a geometry-aware U-Net, a geometry-guided loss with tensor decomposition, and an efficient sampling strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images are degraded by color distortion and scattering, and 4-D light field data contains rich spatial-angular structure. Exploiting this geometry with diffusion priors promises higher fidelity restoration and color accuracy while improving efficiency.

Method: Three adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net with convolutional and attention adapters to capture geometric cues from LF data, (2) a geometry-guided loss using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, (3) an optimized diffusion sampling strategy with noise-prediction to boost efficiency. Builds on SD-Turbo as a baseline and integrates LF geometry with diffusion priors.

Result: Experiments show GeoDiff-LF outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics across underwater LF imaging tasks; ablation studies confirm the benefits of each adaptation; code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates underwater color distortion by leveraging LF geometry and diffusion priors, advancing state-of-the-art in underwater LF imaging and offering a reproducible, efficient approach.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure.

### [11] [Generative Recall, Dense Reranking: Learning Multi-View Semantic IDs for Efficient Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21193)
*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRDR presents a query-guided, multi-view tokenizer with a shared codebook to assign multiple semantic IDs per video, enabling a compact, efficient recall stage that maintains high accuracy while greatly reducing index storage and accelerating full-corpus retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle semantic ambiguity and cross-modal misalignment in generative recall for two-stage TVR, enabling scalable, real-time retrieval at large corpus sizes.

Method: Introduce a query-guided multi-view tokenizer to expose diverse semantic access paths; jointly train the tokenizer and generative retriever using a shared codebook; apply trie-constrained decoding to generate a compact candidate set; use a dense reranker for fine-grained matching.

Result: On TVR benchmarks, GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy, reduces index storage by about an order of magnitude, and achieves up to 300× faster retrieval on full corpora.

Conclusion: GRDR demonstrates that multiple, query-guided semantic IDs derived via a shared codebook can bridge text-video modalities effectively, yielding efficient and accurate recall suitable for large-scale TVR; key areas for future work include improving ID diversity, training efficiency, and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

### [12] [Thinker: A vision-language foundation model for embodied intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21199)
*Baiyu Pan,Daqin Luo,Junpeng Yang,Jiyuan Wang,Yixuan Zhang,Hailin Shi,Jichao Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thinker is a vision-language foundation model for embodied robotics that tackles ego/third-person perspective confusion and temporal reasoning gaps at video endings by (1) building a robotic perception and reasoning dataset (ego-view, grounding, spatial understanding, chain-of-thought) and (2) feeding both key frames and full videos to boost video comprehension, achieving state-of-the-art on two task-planning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVMs struggle with embodied tasks due to perspective confusion (ego vs. external viewpoints) and temporal reasoning errors (information at video endings is often overlooked).Robotics requires robust perception and planning under embodied constraints, which current data and input schemes inadequately support.

Method: A two-pronged approach: (i) construct a large-scale robotic perception dataset including ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data; (ii) adopt a simple yet effective input strategy that jointly uses key frames and full video sequences to improve video comprehension for the model.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two commonly used benchmark datasets for task planning, indicating strong gains in video understanding and embodied reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The combination of a robotics-tailored dataset and a frame-plus-sequence input strategy substantially enhances embodied vision-language capabilities, suggesting that richer temporal context and introspective data (chain-of-thought) can advance planning and perception in embodied AI.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

### [13] [LAMP: Learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Multi-Image Tasks via Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21220)
*Alvi Md Ishmam,Najibul Haque Sarker,Zaber Ibn Abdul Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAMP is a black-box universal adversarial perturbation method for multi-image vision-language models that degrades cross-image aggregation via attention constraints, spreads adversarial effects with a cross-image contagious constraint, and uses an index-attention suppression loss for position-invariant attacks; it achieves the highest attack success across multiple vision-language tasks and models, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multi-image multimodal LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, yet existing attacks focus on single images under white-box assumptions. There is a practical need for black-box, universal perturbations that degrade cross-image aggregation.

Method: LAMP introduces three key components: (1) an attention-based constraint to weaken cross-image information aggregation; (2) a cross-image contagious constraint that propagates perturbations from attacked tokens to clean tokens so not all inputs must be modified; (3) an index-attention suppression loss to ensure robustness against position changes. The method learns universal perturbations in a black-box setting and targets multi-image MLLMs across vision-language tasks.

Result: Empirical results show LAMP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates an effective framework for black-box universal adversarial attacks on multi-image MLLMs, highlighting the importance of cross-image constraints and offering directions for designing robust defenses.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

### [14] [PTQ4ARVG: Post-Training Quantization for AutoRegressive Visual Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21238)
*Xuewen Liu,Zhikai Li,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free post-training quantization framework, PTQ4ARVG, addresses ARVG quantization challenges and achieves 8-bit/6-bit quantization with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARVG models share architecture with language models but quantization methods underperform; three core challenges drive quantization difficulty: (1) severe channel-wise outliers, (2) highly dynamic token-wise activations, (3) mismatched sample-wise distribution information.

Method: GPS (Gain-Projected Scaling) mitigates channel-wise outliers and derives optimal scaling via a Taylor expansion; STWQ (Static Token-Wise Quantization) exploits fixed token length and distribution consistency across samples to reduce token-wise variance without dynamic calibration; DGC (Distribution-Guided Calibration) selects samples that maximize distributional entropy to resolve sample-wise distribution mismatch.

Result: Empirical results show ARVG models quantizable to 8-bit and 6-bit with competitive accuracy, and a codebase is provided at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG offers a training-free, robust quantization framework for ARVG, addressing multi-level distribution and variability challenges and enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

### [15] [NFCDS: A Plug-and-Play Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling Strategy for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21248)
*Zhen Wang,Hongyi Liu,Jianing Li,Zhihui Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play method (NFCDS) uses a Fourier-domain noise-frequency controller to balance fidelity and perceptual quality in image restoration, injecting data-consistency during sampling without extra training and enabling fast, zero-shot improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based PnP methods often trade data fidelity for perceptual quality due to noise in reverse diffusion; improving fidelity while preserving perceptual realism is essential for reliable restoration.

Method: Introduce Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation of reverse-diffusion noise via a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. Integrates as a PnP module to inject a data-consistency prior during sampling; requires no additional training.

Result: Noise-frequency control yields better fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot restoration tasks and accelerates convergence to high-quality results, without retraining, within existing diffusion-based frameworks.

Conclusion: NFCDS reveals a fundamental mechanism for controlling the fidelity-perception trade-off through frequency-domain noise modulation, enabling seamless PnP integration and data-consistency benefits across broad restoration tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

*Esteban Rodríguez-Betancourt,Edgar Casasola-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframe self-supervised representation learning as a discrete packing problem and use short-range hard-ball repulsion (Hypersolid) to enforce injectivity, yielding a high-separation regime that preserves augmentation diversity and improves fine-grained and low-resolution classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent representation collapse in SSL beyond global regularizers by ensuring injectivity via a geometric packing constraint rather than maximizing distances or whitening.

Method: Introduce Hypersolid: a constraint-based approach where short-range hard-ball repulsion penalizes local collisions in the representation space, enforcing a high-separation regime that preserves augmentation diversity.

Result: Achieves strong performance on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks, attributed to preserved augmentation diversity and reduced collisions.

Conclusion: Discrete packing perspective with local repulsion offers an effective alternative to global regularizers for SSL, enabling high-separation representations that maintain diversity and information preservation.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking-face compression framework using FLAME parametric modeling and 3DGS rendering, achieving superior rate-distortion at very low bitrates for real-time 3D video conferencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inability of traditional 2D compression to preserve fine geometry/appearance and the prohibitive cost of implicit rendering (e.g., NeRF) for real-time 3D talking faces.

Method: Integrates FLAME-based parametric face modeling with 3DGS neural rendering; transmits only essential facial metadata in real time using a Gaussian-based head model; introduces compact representation and compression via Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization.

Result: Experiments indicate superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, suitable for real-time 3D video conferencing.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a promising solution for low-bitrate, high-fidelity 3D talking-face transmission, potentially enabling practical real-time 3D video conferencing.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

*Mohit Talreja,Joshua Diao,Jim Thannikary James,Radu Casapu,Tejas Santanam,Ethan Mendes,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a geolocation reasoning-chain benchmark for GeoGuessr; finds large VLMs predict locations well but provide poor auditable reasoning chains; LLM-based judges align best with human scoring; open-weight VLMs fail; gaps suggest need for better extraction of fine-grained visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between high-location-prediction accuracy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their ability to produce verifiable, non-hallucinated reasoning chains grounded in high-resolution visual evidence.

Method: Construct 800 ground-truth reasoning chains for 500 GeoGuessr scenes with expert players; evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge scoring of VLM-generated reasoning against expert chains; compare open and closed-weight VLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-5, Llama, Qwen); assess correlation with human scoring.

Result: Qwen 3 LLM-as-judge shows the best correlation with human scoring; large closed-source VLMs (Gemini, GPT-5) rival humans in locating predictions but lag in generating auditable reasoning; open-weight VLMs (Llama, Qwen) perform only marginally better than a baseline that hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle location but no visual grounding.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit a gap between location accuracy and grounding-explanation capability, suggesting limitations in extracting and grounding fine-grained visual attributes from high-resolution imagery; the benchmark motivates further work on more veridical reasoning and attribute-grounded explanations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

*Dong Chen,Ruoyu Li,Xinyan Zhang,Jialei Xu,Ruoseng Zhao,Zhikang Zhang,Lingyun Li,Zizhuang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework for antenna affiliation identification using video, antenna geometry, and PCI signals, with a Token Entropy Regularization (TER) pretraining to align modalities; demonstrates faster convergence and notable gains; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tower inspections are cumbersome and error-prone; there is a need for automated, robust cross-modal identification leveraging multimodal data.

Method: A dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals for multi-modal classification and matching; introduces Token Entropy Regularization (TER) during pretraining to improve representation alignment; TER targets the entropy of the first token, with evidence that this entropy is modality-dependent.

Result: TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains; ablations reveal the first-token entropy is modality-dependent, supporting the design choice.

Conclusion: TER provides an effective, lightweight pretraining regularizer for cross-modal alignment in antenna identification; code will be made available; the approach promises improvements in automated network maintenance workflows.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

*Rishi Upadhyay,Howard Zhang,Jim Solomon,Ayush Agrawal,Pranay Boreddy,Shruti Satya Narayana,Yunhao Ba,Alex Wong,Celso M de Melo,Achuta Kadambi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldBench is a disentangled, concept-specific video benchmark for evaluating physics understanding in world models, addressing entanglement in existing benchmarks by separating tests by physical concepts and constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics benchmarks entangle multiple physical laws, hindering diagnostic evaluation; there is a need for concept-specific, interpretable evaluation to improve the reliability of generative world models for robotics and autonomous systems.

Method: Design two-level benchmark: (1) high-level intuitive concepts (object permanence, scale/perspective) and (2) low-level constants/material properties (friction, viscosity); construct video tasks that isolate single concepts, and evaluate state-of-the-art video-based world models to identify specific failures and assess physical consistency.

Result: WorldBench reveals systematic concept-specific failures and a lack of physical consistency across tested models, indicating current models struggle to generalize real-world interactions.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a nuanced, scalable framework for rigorous evaluation of physical reasoning in video generation and world models, enabling more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GBPN is a hybrid DL + probabilistic graphical model for depth completion that dynamically builds a scene-specific MRF via GMCN and infers it with Gaussian Belief Propagation, yielding state-of-the-art results on NYUv2 and KITTI across varying sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of sparse, irregular depth data in deep networks and to capture long-range spatial dependencies by learning both the MRF potentials and its structure, enabling robust, generalizable depth completion.

Method: Construct a scene-specific MRF with data-driven potentials and adaptive non-local edges using Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN); perform end-to-end inference with Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) using a serial & parallel message passing scheme to propagate information from sparse measurements.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and KITTI; robust across different sparsity levels and patterns; strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective integration of deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for depth completion; highlights importance of learning MRF structure and GBP-based inference; suggests potential for broader adoption of non-local edge learning and GBP in vision tasks.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

TL;DR: Mam-App: a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for apple leaf disease classification achieving near-SOTA performance with only 0.051M parameters across multiple crops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce crop losses due to diseases by enabling accurate leaf disease detection on resource-constrained devices (drones, mobile).

Method: Proposes Mam-App, a lightweight feature extractor/classifier based on Mamba architecture; evaluated on PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease, Corn Leaf Disease, Potato Leaf Disease datasets; reports high accuracy with a very small parameter count.

Result: Apple: 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, 99.22% F1 with 0.051M params; Corn: 99.48% acc, 99.20% precision, 99.34% recall, 99.27% F1; Potato: 98.46% acc, 98.91% precision, 95.39% recall, 97.01% F1.

Conclusion: Shows a strong efficiency–performance trade-off and potential for deployment on low-resource platforms; demonstrated generalization across crops; but requires clarification on data splits, averaging methods, and validation on real-world field data.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LANE introduces latent autoregressive modeling with AdaGraph to enable long 1D-tokenized 3D mesh generation, achieving 6× longer sequences and faster inference while improving detail and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D meshes are often tokenized into 1D sequences and modeled autoregressively, but existing methods suffer from poor resource utilization, slow inference, and limited sequence length, restricting expressible geometric detail.

Method: Propose Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE) with compact autoregressive dependencies for efficient generation, and Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) to decouple spatiotemporal aspects and overcome serial inference bottlenecks during generation.

Result: Empirical results show LANE achieves faster generation, greater structural detail, and better geometric consistency, with a 6× increase in the maximum generatable sequence length over prior methods.

Conclusion: LANE with AdaGraph provides an effective framework for high-quality, scalable 3D mesh generation, delivering both improved speed and richer geometric detail.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

*Keke Tang,Ziyong Du,Xiaofei Wang,Weilong Peng,Peican Zhu,Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-based framework to reduce OOD overconfidence by constructing OT-induced OOD samples (OTIS) near singular OT boundaries and applying a confidence suppression loss during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs tend to make overconfident predictions on OOD inputs, and semi-discrete OT surfaces singularities that indicate semantic ambiguity. Exploiting this geometry can yield informative, ambiguity-grounded training samples to improve calibration.

Method: Formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and latent embeddings of training data; identify singular boundaries; sample near the boundaries to produce OTIS; apply a confidence suppression loss on OTIS to steer predictions toward calibration in uncertain regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant alleviation of OOD overconfidence and performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: OT geometry provides a principled mechanism to generate structurally uncertain samples and shape loss to improve model calibration in OOD regions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Pritika Vig,Ren-Chin Wu,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models implicitly encode continuous disease progression in latent space; diffusion pseudotime reveals trajectory structure across cancer progressions; trajectory fidelity correlates with few-shot generalization; results support using trajectory-based measures as a complement to downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether static, discretely-sampled training data allow vision foundation models to learn continuous disease progression representations in pathology, and whether trajectory fidelity reflects representation quality and generalization.

Method: Apply diffusion pseudotime to latent representations from six models across four cancer progressions; assess trajectory orderings against null baselines; compare trajectory fidelity across models; correlate trajectory fidelity with few-shot classification on held-out diseases; analyze cell-type composition along trajectories.

Result: All pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly better than null baselines; vision-only models achieve the highest trajectory fidelity (τ > 0.78 for CRC-Serrated); model rankings by trajectory fidelity predict few-shot performance on held-out diseases (ρ = 0.92); cell-type composition varies smoothly along trajectories consistent with known stromal remodeling.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models implicitly learn continuous biological processes from static data, and trajectory fidelity offers a complementary metric of representation quality beyond downstream performance; the framework is potentially applicable to other domains with gradual processes observed via static snapshots.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight plug-and-play rectifier (SR^2-Net) boosts spectral fidelity in HSI-SR by adding H-S^3A and MCR with a degradation-consistency loss, without altering base network architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral consistency across bands is often neglected in hyperspectral SR, causing oscillations and physically implausible artifacts; a general, architecture-agnostic solution is sought."

Method: Attach SR^2-Net as an enhancement-then-rectification module to existing HSI-SR models. Core components: (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S^3A) to strengthen cross-band interactions; (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold; plus a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by aligning degraded SR outputs with the observed LR input.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and backbones show consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead; code will be released after publication.

Conclusion: A general, lightweight rectifier that can be plugged into diverse HSI-SR models, improving spectral coherence and reconstruction quality without sacrificing architectural flexibility.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input.

### [27] [Dynamical Adapter Fusion: Constructing A Global Adapter for Pre-Trained Model-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21341)
*Ruiqi Liu,Boyu Diao,Zijia An,Zhulin An,Fei Wang,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAF proposes a single robust global adapter for class-incremental learning by dynamically fusing task-specific adapters with prior/global/init parameters using PAC-Bayes and Taylor expansion; achieves SOTA on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIL with adapter-based methods struggles to transfer knowledge and avoid interference when maintaining many task-specific adapters; a single adaptable model should maximize knowledge transfer while mitigating forgetting.

Method: Derives optimal fusion coefficients via PAC-Bayes; uses Taylor expansion of the loss to balance stability and plasticity; fuses three sources—task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and initialization parameters—into one global adapter; introduces a Robust Initialization strategy to capture global patterns.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded dynamic fusion mechanism to construct a single robust global adapter for CIL, improving stability-plasticity trade-off and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDS shapes activation subspaces to enable transfer among similar classes and separation among dissimilar ones, using targeted sparsification to mitigate interference in class-incremental learning, without constraining the parameter space; claims state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the plasticity-interference trade-off in class-incremental learning (CIL). Traditional methods freeze a backbone and constrain adapters to be orthogonal, which harms plasticity. Propose a semantic-guided, dynamic sparsification in activation space to guide subspace orientation and rank.

Method: Introduce Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) that enforces class-specific sparse activation subspaces. Similar classes share compact subspaces; dissimilar classes have non-overlapping subspaces. Subspace shaping is driven by semantic guidance and dynamic sparsification, aiming to improve knowledge transfer and reduce interference without rigid parameter constraints.

Result: Claims state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for CIL, demonstrating effectiveness of activation-space sparsification over traditional parameter-space constraints.

Conclusion: SGDS mitigates interference by sculpting activation-space subspaces rather than constraining parameters, enabling improved plasticity and knowledge transfer in CIL.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

### [29] [Rectifying Geometry-Induced Similarity Distortions for Real-World Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21405)
*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry distortions break geometry-agnostic attention in aerial-ground ReID; the paper proposes GIQT to rectify query-key similarity via a geometry-conditioned, low-rank transform and adds a geometry-aware prompt generator, yielding robust cross-view matching with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme camera viewpoints and distances create severe geometric distortions that invalidate the assumption of a shared geometry-invariant similarity space in attention-based ReID. Existing methods relying on geometry-aware features or prompting fail to correct the underlying query-key similarity space.

Method: Introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that conditions query-key interactions on camera geometry to rectify the similarity space without altering feature representations or the attention mechanism. Additionally, implement a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive priors derived from geometry.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four aerial-ground ReID benchmarks shows consistent robustness gains under extreme and unseen geometric conditions, with minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GIQT effectively rectifies geometry-induced distortions in the query-key similarity space and, together with geometry-conditioned prompts, enhances cross-view ReID robustness while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [30] [Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21406)
*Zihan Su,Hongyang Wei,Kangrui Cen,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Chun Yuan,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMRG is a post-training, architecture-agnostic method that adds auxiliary generation tasks (pixel reconstruction, depth, and segmentation) to unified multimodal models, yielding improved understanding (perception, spatial reasoning, reduced hallucinations) and enhanced generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap where generation feedback improves understanding in unified multimodal models by leveraging diverse intrinsic representations to capture appearance, geometry, and structure.

Method: Post-training framework UniMRG adds auxiliary generation objectives (pixel-level reconstruction, depth estimation, and segmentation map synthesis) alongside standard understanding losses, in an architecture-agnostic manner, to UMMs.

Result: Across multiple UMM architectures, UniMRG improves fine-grained perception and spatial understanding, reduces hallucinations, and yields gains in generation quality, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of generation-guided understanding.

Conclusion: Generating intrinsic representations during post-training enriches UMMs’ representations, enabling better perception and reasoning while simultaneously boosting generation, suggesting broad applicability of multi-representation generation for unified multimodal systems.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

### [31] [MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408)
*Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Yue Zhou,Jiaming Zhong,Wei Ye,Wenhui Yi,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Haodong Li,Bo Cao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new MPF-based forensic framework detects AI-generated videos by exploiting Manifold Projection Fluctuations via a two-branch hierarchical filter: Static Manifold Deviation Branch (off-manifold spatial anomalies using VFMs) and Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch (on-manifold subtle temporal fingerprints).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite high visual fidelity, AI videos reveal structured MPF due to the manifold-fitting process; there is a need robust detectors that leverage both spatial and temporal residuals to distinguish synthetic content from real video.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical dual-path framework that acts as a sequential filter. The Static Manifold Deviation Branch uses refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models to detect residual spatial anomalies that deviate from the real-world manifold (off-manifold). For videos on-manifold, the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch serves as a secondary, fine-grained filter to capture persistent micro-temporal fluctuations.

Result: Conceptual framework with the goal of exposing forgeries that either show off-manifold spatial deviations or subtle on-manifold computational fingerprints; no empirical results are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: MPF-based hierarchical detection offers robust multi-level scrutiny for AI-generated videos by leveraging both spatial deviations and micro-temporal patterns, enabling detection even when macro realism is preserved.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [32] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Implicit NeRFs fail under heavy occlusion due to Interior Geometric Degradation; explicit SfM-based geometry with Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) improves instance recovery to ~95.8% in dense scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess reliability of neural radiance fields for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes; identify a fundamental failure mode and propose a robust alternative.

Method: Diagnose Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD) in transmittance-based volumetric optimization; conduct synthetic occlusion experiments showing ~89% recovery for state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs; introduce explicit geometry pipeline (SVRaster) initialized from SfM feature geometry; project 2D instance masks onto a voxel grid; enforce geometric separation via recursive splitting; evaluate against degraded supervision.

Result: Implicit NeRFs saturate at ~89% instance recovery in dense scenes; SVRaster-based explicit geometry achieves 95.8% recovery; explicit geometry is more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes; coupling SfM geometry with voxel-based representations mitigates Interior Geometric Degradation and improves solidity and recoverability of instances.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones by generating synthetic image captions with multimodal LLMs for fine-tuning, using a supervised contrastive loss and class-averaged text embeddings to achieve strong gains, especially in few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a disconnect between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning; leveraging rich multimodal representations during fine-tuning could improve downstream classification performance by providing synthetic multimodal signals.

Method: Use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality captions for images by prompts that incorporate class labels and domain context. Train with a multimodal objective on the synthetic captions. Introduce a supervised contrastive loss to pull same-class representations together during fine-tuning. For inference, use class-averaged text embeddings drawn from multiple synthetic captions per image.

Result: Extensive experiments on 13 image classification benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms baselines, with particularly large gains in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Proposes a new dataset enhancement paradigm that bridges multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrating that synthetic multimodal data can significantly improve classification; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

TL;DR: Spava is a sequence-parallel framework for long-video inference in large multimodal models (LMMs) that distributes approximate attention across multiple GPUs, avoiding embedding compression, and uses system-level optimizations to achieve substantial speedups over existing attention schemes without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video inference is bottlenecked by dense computation in the prefill stage of LMMs. Existing approaches either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, which fails to scale to longer, more complex videos.

Method: Introduce Spava, a sequence-parallel framework that distributes approximate attention across multiple GPUs. It preserves visual embeddings without compression, employs optimized attention, and incorporates system-level enhancements such as load balancing and fused forward passes to maximize GPU utilization.

Result: Achieves speedups of 12.72x over FlashAttn, 1.70x over ZigZagRing, and 1.18x over APB in long-video inference tasks, with no notable performance loss. Code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Spava enables efficient, scalable long-video inference for LMMs on multi-GPU systems, outperforming relevant baselines and facilitating processing of longer, more complex videos.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diagnostic comparison of seven metric-learning losses (Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, CCL) using VARIANCE and GREEDINESS across five datasets; finds Triplet/SCL preserve within-class variance and margins, aiding top-1 in fine-grained tasks; Contrastive/InfoNCE yield fast convergence with compact embeddings; N-pair offers large mean separation with uneven spacing; frames an efficiency–granularity trade-off and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal how loss choice shapes embedding geometry and optimization dynamics in image retrieval, enabling informed loss selection for different data regimes and retrieval goals.

Method: Introduce VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms) as diagnostic metrics; evaluate seven losses across five image-retrieval datasets.

Result: Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, improving top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings; Contrastive and InfoNCE achieve compact embeddings rapidly via many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structure; N-pair achieves large mean separation but with uneven spacing.

Conclusion: Highlights an efficiency–granularity trade-off in metric learning; guidance for practitioners: prefer Triplet or SCL when preserving diversity and hard-sample discrimination are crucial; opt for Contrastive or InfoNCE when fast embedding compaction is desired; provides actionable recommendations for loss selection in image retrieval.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces RT-DeepLoc, a weakly supervised temporal deepfake localization framework using a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on authentic data and an Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL) to localize forgeries via reconstruction errors, achieving state-of-the-art results on LAV-DF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-level annotations for video forgery are costly; there is a need for weakly supervised methods that can localize localized and intermittent manipulations using only video-level labels.

Method: Train a Masked Autoencoder on authentic videos to learn normal spatiotemporal patterns. Forgery segments yield larger reconstruction errors, serving as localization cues. Introduce Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss to encourage authentic feature compactness guided by reconstruction cues, creating a stable decision boundary and improving local discrimination while generalizing to unseen forgeries.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, show RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised temporal forgery localization.

Conclusion: Reconstruction-based weak supervision combined with AICL effectively localizes forgeries under weak supervision, with strong empirical performance and potential for generalization to unseen manipulations; further work could explore robustness to diverse manipulation types and parameter sensitivity.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Motivation: Physician device-use decisions rely on patient-specific tabular data, which standard MIL on imaging alone may not capture; there is a need for adaptive aggregation that leverages non-imaging data to inform decisions.

Method: Propose HyperAdAgFormer, a hypernetwork that generates per-patient aggregation parameters for a transformer-based MIL, conditioned on tabular data to adapt the feature aggregation strategy for each patient.

Result: Clinical dataset experiments demonstrate effectiveness of HyperAdAgFormer; code publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The work presents a first attempt at patient-specific adaptive MIL for device-use decisions from CT images and shows feasibility of integrating tabular data into MIL; releases code for reproducibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempt to estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications from computed tomography (CT) images. We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork. The experiments using the clinical dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of HyperAdAgFormer. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/HyperAdAgFormer.

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimGraph is a unified scene-graph-driven framework that combines token-based generation and diffusion-based editing for image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence, and it outperforms current SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GenAI image generation and editing approaches are often treated as separate tasks, causing inefficiencies and difficulties in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence; scene graph representations offer structured control over object relations and layouts, but there is a lack of a unified framework that leverages this for both generation and editing.

Method: Propose SimGraph, a single model that uses a scene-graph representation to guide both generation and editing. It integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene-graph-driven framework, ensuring precise control over object interactions and spatial arrangements.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGraph outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, delivering high-quality, consistent results with improved spatial coherence and semantic alignment between content and edits.

Conclusion: A unified scene-graph-driven framework enables precise control over object interactions and layouts across generation and editing tasks, yielding high-quality, coherent results that surpass existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HERS: domain-specific expert adaptation for diffusion-generated vehicle-damage images; improves fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment via per-damage experts and self-supervised data; gains observed across four backbones; discusses safety implications for auto-insurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate misuse and unreliability of text-to-image diffusion in auto-insurance workflows by enabling high-fidelity, controllable, and auditable damage imagery through domain-aligned generation.

Method: Fine-tune a base diffusion model with domain-specific experts: train separate experts for each damage category (dents, scratches, broken lights, cracked paint) using self-supervised image-text pairs generated by an LLM and a T2I pipeline; integrate experts into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization and generalization; validate across four diffusion backbones.

Result: Consistent improvements: +5.5% in text faithfulness and +2.3% in human preference over baselines; improvements observed across all four backbones; discussion extends to fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a feasible approach to domain-aligned, high-stakes diffusion generation; highlights opportunities for trustworthy automation in insurance while also acknowledging risks and governance needs.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

*Zhuoqin Yang,Jiansong Zhang,Xiaoling Luo,Xu Wu,Zheng Lu,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViK is an attention-free vision backbone that uses MultiPatch-RBFKAN to enable efficient token mixing with linear complexity, achieving competitive ImageNet-1K accuracy and offering a theoretically grounded alternative to attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic complexity and limited interpretability of attention mechanisms in vision transformers, by exploring an attention-free architecture that can still model long-range dependencies.

Method: Introduce Vision KAN (ViK) with MultiPatch-RBFKAN as the core token mixer. It combines (i) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), (ii) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (iii) low-rank global mapping for long-range interactions. A patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators enables ViK to be a drop-in replacement for attention modules while reducing the cost of full KANs on high-resolution features.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear (i.e., O(N)) complexity, demonstrating that KAN-based token mixing can serve as an efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

Conclusion: KAN-based token mixing in ViK offers a promising, scalable, and interpretable alternative to attention for vision backbones, validating the potential of attention-free architectures and highlighting directions for efficient long-range interaction modeling.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

### [42] [Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver for Accelerating Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21542)
*Hongxu Chen,Hongxiang Li,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BA-solver introduces a lightweight SideNet to accelerate Flow Matching-based generation by densifying trajectories via bidirectional temporal perception and bi-anchor velocity integration. It achieves high-quality samples with 5–10 NFEs, maintains negligible training cost, and remains plug-and-play-compatible with existing pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching (FM) models rely on iterative ODE solving, which incurs a latency bottleneck. Training-free solvers degrade at low NFEs, while training-based methods incur high costs and lack versatility. A method that blends speed, accuracy, and plug-and-play compatibility is needed.

Method: BA-solver uses a frozen backbone for high-precision anchors and a lightweight SideNet (1-2% of backbone) trained to provide bidirectional velocity estimates. It employs Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, leveraging two anchor velocities to approximate intermediate velocities for high-order integration. The backbone supplies anchors; SideNet densifies the trajectory to enable large intervals with minimal error.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ImageNet-256^2 shows BA-solver delivers generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs of Euler solver using only 10 NFEs, with high fidelity achievable at 5 NFEs. It incurs negligible training costs and integrates seamlessly with existing generative pipelines.

Conclusion: BA-solver offers a versatile, efficient, plug-and-play acceleration for FM-based generation. It achieves substantial speedups with limited training overhead and preserves high generation quality, enabling practical deployment and downstream tasks such as image editing.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

*Luwei Tu,Jiawei Wu,Xing Luo,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware diffusion bridge reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem with relaxed constraints and dual modulation, enabling single-pass, state-of-the-art restoration across diverse degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AiOIR must reconcile conflicting objectives from heterogeneous degradations; existing coarse control and fixed schedules yield suboptimal adaptation. A principled, uncertainty-aware framework is needed to unify restoration tasks.

Method: Introduce UDBM: a diffusion-bridge with relaxed terminal constraint to model degradation uncertainty and resolve drift singularity. Employ dual modulation: (1) a noise schedule that maps diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, (2) a path schedule that adaptively regulates transport dynamics via entropy-regularization-inspired viscous effects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance across diverse tasks in a single inference step.

Conclusion: UDBM rectifies transport geometry/dynamics under uncertainty, providing a theoretically grounded, unified AiOIR framework that handles heterogeneous degradations more effectively than prior methods.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

TL;DR: HydroSense is an IoT-based six-parameter water-quality monitor using a dual-MCU design (Arduino Uno for precise analog sensing with five-point pH calibration; ESP32 for wireless edge processing and cloud integration). It features median-filtered TDS, temperature compensation, robust error handling, and Firebase real-time database. Validated over 90 days with high accuracy and 99.8% cloud reliability, at ≈$300 cost, about 85% cheaper than commercial systems.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration.

### [45] [WMVLM: Evaluating Diffusion Model Image Watermarking via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21610)
*Zijin Yang,Yu Sun,Kejiang Chen,Jiawei Zhao,Jun Jiang,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, interpretable evaluation framework (WMVLM) for diffusion-model image watermarking via vision-language models, featuring residual and semantic watermark metrics, a three-stage training pipeline, and strong generalization across datasets and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods lack a unified framework for residual and semantic watermarks, interpretability, and comprehensive security considerations in diffusion-model watermarking; existing metrics are often inappropriate for semantic watermarks.

Method: Introduce WMVLM, redefine quality/security metrics (artifact strength and erasure resistance for residual watermarks; latent distribution shifts for semantic watermarks), and implement a three-stage training strategy to enable classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation in a VLM-based evaluator; validate generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Result: WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs and generalizes well across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: WMVLM provides a unified, interpretable framework for evaluating diffusion-model image watermarking, addressing previous gaps and enabling robust, generalizable assessment across watermark types.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

### [46] [PathReasoner-R1: Instilling Structured Reasoning into Pathology Vision-Language Model via Knowledge-Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21617)
*Songhan Jiang,Fengchun Liu,Ziyue Wang,Linghan Cai,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoner introduces PathReasoner, a large-scale WSI reasoning dataset, and PathReasoner-R1, a model trained with trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning, guided by knowledge graphs to produce verifiable, chain-of-thought reasoning for pathology. It claims state-of-the-art results and provides dataset/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lack of verifiable, evidence-linked reasoning in vision-language models for pathology, which undermines clinical trust and error rectification.

Method: Create PathReasoner dataset via a knowledge-guided generation pipeline using medical knowledge graphs to align findings and diagnoses; train PathReasoner-R1 with trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented RL; apply a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward with an Entity Reward aligned to knowledge graphs to enforce logical consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathReasoner and public benchmarks across multiple image scales; demonstrates transparent, clinically grounded reasoning; dataset and code are available.

Conclusion: PathReasoner-R1 provides robust, interpretable reasoning for pathology VLMs, enabling clinical trust and error rectification; the approach integrates explicit knowledge graphs and structured reasoning into training and evaluation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cyclexfy/PathReasoner-R1.

### [47] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how vision models converge to similar representations, focusing on the intermediate steps and processes that lead to convergence. It quantifies how representations evolve across layers and models to identify where they differ most.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand not just end-state representation convergence across models, but the dynamics and intermediate steps that produce similar representations across different architectures, objectives, datasets, and modalities.

Method: Quantify distances between model representations at multiple stages across different models (e.g., CNNs, Transformers, and classifier heads). Track the evolution of these distances through layers to identify steps with the greatest divergence; compare intra-model layer progression for CNNs vs. Transformers.

Result: Layers at similar positions across models show the most similar representations, but substantial differences remain. Classifier models tend to discard low-level image statistics in their final layers. Transformers exhibit smoother layer-to-layer changes in representations, while CNNs show a different progression, highlighting distinct dynamical paths to convergence.

Conclusion: The work delineates the level and nature of representation convergence and provides a qualitative account of the intermediate processes in image models that lead to similar end-state representations across architectures.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

### [48] [A Tilted Seesaw: Revisiting Autoencoder Trade-off for Controllable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21633)
*Pu Cao,Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Qing Song,Lu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageNet-scale autoencoders biased toward gFID over reconstruction; this skews AE selection and harms controllability due to condition drift; reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level, better predicts controllability; gFID weakly predicts condition preservation; empirical validation with multiple ImageNet AEs and ControlNet supports this; implies benchmarking should prioritize reconstruction and condition-preservation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why gFID-dominant AE evaluation can be misleading for scalable controllable diffusion and how condition drift affects controllability; propose evaluation approaches that align with controllability needs.

Method: Theoretical analysis of how autoencoders induce condition drift; design of a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol; empirical tests on several ImageNet AEs; controlNet experiments to measure controllability; comparison of gFID vs reconstruction metrics as predictors of condition preservation.

Result: gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation; reconstruction-oriented metrics (particularly instance-level) strongly align with controllability; tilting AE selection toward gFID degrades controllability; ControlNet experiments confirm condition-preservation as the key driver of controllability.

Conclusion: There is a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and requirements of scalable controllable diffusion; benchmarking should prioritize reconstruction fidelity and condition-preservation; adopt multi-dimensional drift assessment for reliable model selection.

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

### [49] [RSGround-R1: Rethinking Remote Sensing Visual Grounding through Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21634)
*Shiqi Huang,Shuting He,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-training framework, RSGround-R1, enhances spatial reasoning for remote sensing visual grounding by chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning with synthetic data, reinforced fine-tuning with a positional reward, and a spatial-consistency optimization to ensure coherent localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing imagery is vast in scale with high semantic ambiguity, causing descriptions to lean on positional cues. Standard multimodal models struggle with precise spatial localization in this domain, necessitating targeted spatial reasoning.

Method: 1) CoT-SFT using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to instill explicit position awareness. 2) Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with a novel positional reward that provides continuous, distance-aware localization guidance. 3) Spatial consistency guided optimization that adapts policy updates based on spatial coherence to stabilize rollouts across training.

Result: Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks show superior performance and better generalization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RSGround-R1 effectively enhances spatial understanding for RS visual grounding, yielding robust, coherent localization and improved generalization in large-scale aerial scenes.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Wenkang Han,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Deyang Jiang,Yilin Cao,Lin Ma,Zhixiong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCRVerse is a unified, end-to-end OCR model that handles both text-centric (documents) and vision-centric (charts, web pages, scientific plots) data. It uses a two-stage SFT-RL training regime to fuse cross-domain knowledge while allowing domain-specific rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap between traditional text-centric OCR and the demand to extract information from visually dense images common on the web and in science, enabling a single model for diverse multimodal OCR tasks.

Method: Develop comprehensive data engineering for both text-centric documents and vision-centric composites; employ a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on mixed-domain data to bootstrap cross-domain knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with domain-specific reward signals to tailor outputs for each domain and support flexible reward design during cross-domain fusion.

Result: OCRVerse achieves competitive performance on both text-centric and vision-centric data, approaching or matching large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: A holistic end-to-end OCR framework is feasible for extracting text and visual elements across dense images; the SFT-RL training strategy enables effective cross-domain generalization and customizable domain outputs.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

### [51] [CAF-Mamba: Mamba-Based Cross-Modal Adaptive Attention Fusion for Multimodal Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21648)
*Bowen Zhou,Marc-André Fiedler,Ayoub Al-Hamadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAF-Mamba proposes a Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion for depression detection, enabling explicit/implicit cross-modal interactions with dynamic modality weighting, achieving state-of-the-art results on LMVD and D-Vlog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is detectable via multiple modalities (e.g., audio, visual, text), but prior deep learning models use limited feature types, ignore cross-modal interactions, and rely on simple fusion; thus, there is a need for a fusion framework that models cross-modal interactions explicitly and adapts modality contributions dynamically for robust multimodal depression detection.

Method: CAF-Mamba introduces a Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. It captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly and employs a modality-wise attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the contribution of each modality, enabling effective multimodal fusion for depression detection.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two in-the-wild benchmarks, LMVD and D-Vlog, shows that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work advances multimodal depression detection by explicitly modeling cross-modal interactions and adopting adaptive fusion to weigh modalities according to their reliability. It demonstrates strong performance on diverse, in-the-wild datasets, suggesting good generalization; future work could explore ablations, robustness to noise, and broader modality sets.

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Marcel Dreier,Nora Gourmelon,Dakota Pyles,Thorsten Seehaus,Matthias H. Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Few-shot domain adaptation with priors and summer references dramatically improves glacier calving front delineation in a novel site, reducing error from ~1.13 km to ~69 m without changing model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome domain shift when applying benchmark-trained delineation models to unseen study sites, enabling reliable, scalable calving-front monitoring.

Method: Apply a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporate spatial static prior knowledge, and include summer reference images in the input time series; no architectural modifications.

Result: Delineation error decreased from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a practical framework for generalizing deep learning-based calving-front segmentation to new sites, facilitating global-scale monitoring.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

### [53] [When Gradient Optimization Is Not Enough: $\dagger$ Dispersive and Anchoring Geometric Regularizer for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21670)
*Zixuan Xia,Hao Wang,Pengcheng Weng,Yanyu Qian,Yangxin Xu,William Dan,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a geometry-aware regularization framework (REGName) for multimodal learning to address intra-modal representation collapse and cross-modal drift. It adds two plug-and-play constraints—intra-modal dispersive and inter-modal anchoring—on intermediate embeddings, improving both multimodal fusion and unimodal robustness without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often suffer from representation geometry pathologies such as intra-modal collapse and sample-level cross-modal drift, which degrade unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion. A robust control axis on geometry is lacking.

Method: Introduce REGName with two complementary, placement-on-embedding constraints: (1) intra-modal dispersive regularization to promote diversity within each modality, and (2) inter-modal anchoring regularization to bound cross-modal drift at the sample level without rigid alignment. The regularizer is lightweight, plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with various training paradigms.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple multimodal benchmarks show consistent improvements in both multimodal performance and unimodal robustness, indicating that geometry-aware regularization mitigates modality trade-offs and enhances overall representation quality.

Conclusion: Explicitly regulating representation geometry is effective for multimodal learning. REGName provides a lightweight, versatile, and easy-to-apply regularization framework that improves fusion and robustness without changing model architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

TL;DR: MVSC compresses 3D sMRI into compact 2D visual surrogates to enable efficient, discriminative AD classification by aligning with frozen 2D foundation models, using a Volume Context Encoder guided by text and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational cost of 3D CNNs, loss of cross-slice information in slice-wise methods, and limited discriminative power of 2D foundation-model features when applied to 3D MRI.

Method: Two-stage architecture: Volume Context Encoder captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance; Adaptive Slice Fusion aggregates slice-level features in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner; compresses 3D volume into 2D visual surrogates optimized to work with frozen 2D foundation models. Evaluated on three AD benchmarks with binary and multi-class tasks.

Result: MVSC achieves favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale AD benchmarks for both binary and multi-class classification. (Details not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: MVSC provides a computationally efficient, cross-slice-aware representation learning approach by leveraging 2D foundation models through surrogate 2D features, showing promise across benchmarks and potential for broader applications.

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartE^3 is a new end-to-end chart-editing benchmark that evaluates local (appearance) and global (data-centric) edits without relying on intermediate NL/code, using chart image, code, and multimodal instructions; results show gaps in SOTA models, especially for global edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end chart editing is practical but challenging due to the need for fine-grained control and global consistency; existing pipeline-based approaches restrict faithful execution; a benchmark is needed to measure true end-to-end capability.

Method: Construct ChartE^3 with 1,200+ curated samples, each as (chart image, underlying code, multimodal editing instruction); two editing dimensions (local and global); data pipeline with human curation; evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs on these tasks.

Result: SOTA multimodal LLMs exhibit substantial performance gaps, especially on global editing tasks, indicating critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

Conclusion: ChartE^3 provides a rigorous evaluation platform for end-to-end chart editing, underscoring the need for improved models that can perform holistic, data-centric edits without intermediate representations.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

*Mingshuang Luo,Shuang Liang,Zhengkun Rong,Yuxuan Luo,Tianshu Hu,Ruibing Hou,Hong Chang,Yong Li,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamActor-M2: a universal, RGB-driven character animation framework that reinterprets motion conditioning as in-context learning, using a two-stage process (unified latent fusion of appearance and motion cues, plus a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline) to improve identity preservation, motion consistency, and generalization across diverse characters; introduced AW Bench for evaluation; achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two core limitations: (1) suboptimal motion injection causing a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons) that fail to capture rich dynamics and hinder generalization to non-humanoid characters.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) fuse reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space to enable joint reasoning about spatial identity and temporal dynamics using the priors of foundational generative models; (2) employ a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline to create pseudo cross-identity training pairs, enabling a progression from pose-dependent control to end-to-end RGB-driven animation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization across diverse characters and motions, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: DreamActor-M2 offers a universal animation framework capable of generalizing across character types and motion scenarios, supported by the AW Bench benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

### [57] [From Global to Granular: Revealing IQA Model Performance via Correlation Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21738)
*Baoliang Chen,Danni Huang,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Wei Zhou,Shiqi Wang,Yuming Fang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC) for IQA evaluation, producing a 3D correlation surface over MOS and |ΔMOS| to reveal local ranking behaviors hidden by global metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global correlation metrics (PLCC, SRCC) reduce model performance to a single scalar and fail to capture how ranking consistency varies across the MOS spectrum; they are sensitive to test-sample distributions, hindering cross-dataset comparisons. A fine-grained, distribution-aware analysis is needed.

Method: Granularity Modulator applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences (|ΔMOS|) to analyze local performance variations; Distribution Regulator regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions; results are presented as a 3D correlation surface mapping correlation as a function of MOS and |ΔMOS|.

Result: GMC yields a correlation surface that uncovers local performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics; experiments on standard IQA benchmarks demonstrate its diagnostic value and reliability; implementation code is released at GitHub.

Conclusion: GMC provides a more informative and reliable framework for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models through a granularity-aware, distribution-regularized correlation analysis.

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

TL;DR: DGNav: Dynamic Topological Navigation for VLN-CE that resolves Granularity Rigidity via scene-aware graph densification and a Dynamic Graph Transformer. It adaptively modulates map density based on waypoint dispersion and fuses visual, linguistic, and geometric cues to compute dynamic edge weights, improving instruction adherence, safety, and generalization on R2R-CE and RxR-CE; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological maps in Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) suffer Granularity Rigidity due to fixed sampling thresholds, causing over-sampling in easy regions and under-sampling in uncertain ones. This harms efficiency and safety, particularly for long-horizon instructions.

Method: 1) Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy: dynamically adjusts graph construction thresholds according to dispersion of predicted waypoints to densify on challenging areas. 2) Dynamic Graph Transformer: rebuilds graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights to filter noise and improve instruction adherence.

Result: Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show DGNav achieves superior navigation performance and strong generalization; ablations confirm a favorable trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Conclusion: DGNav addresses Granularity Rigidity with adaptive density and multimodal dynamic connectivity, enabling robust, efficient VLN-CE navigation. Code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-view 3D ship reconstruction from synthetic data using Splatter Image network with 3D Gaussian representation, complemented by YOLOv8-based segmentation and postprocessing for georeferenced map placement; achieves efficient, annotation-free 3D ships suitable for real-time maritime monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time, single-view 3D ship visualization without multi-view supervision or real 3D ground-truth, addressing practicality gaps in maritime monitoring.

Method: Train Splatter Image network to represent ships as sparse 3D Gaussians; pretrain on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and refine with a custom 3D ship dataset; integrate YOLOv8 segmentation; apply preprocessing; scale/center/orient; georeference and map onto interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography; evaluate on synthetic data and test qualitatively on ShipSG images.

Result: Quantitative tests on synthetic validation show strong reconstruction fidelity; qualitative results on ShipSG demonstrate transfer to real-world imagery; final system enables interactive 3D inspection of real ships without real-world 3D annotations.

Conclusion: Efficient, scalable single-view 3D ship reconstruction pipeline bridging synthetic and real domains, enabling practical real-time visualization for maritime monitoring without 3D ground-truth data.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

TL;DR: CG-MLLM: a multi-modal LLM enabling 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation via a mixture-of-transformers that decouples token-level (TokenAR) and block-level (BlockAR) content, integrated with a 3D VAE latent space and a vision-language backbone, achieving state-of-the-art 3D fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D content generation remains underexplored; existing MLLMs often produce low-res meshes or coarse proxies and struggle with fine-grained geometry; a unified architecture is needed for native high-resolution 3D content and long-context cross-modal interactions.

Method: Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT): TokenAR handles token-level content; BlockAR handles block-level content. A pre-trained vision-language backbone is integrated with a specialized 3D VAE latent space to enable long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks in a single architecture.

Result: Experimental results indicate CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity, high-resolution 3D objects within a single framework.

Conclusion: Presents a unified, high-resolution 3D-capable MLLM that brings high-fidelity 3D content creation into mainstream LLMs by decoupling content modeling and leveraging a 3D latent space.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMFineReason is a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset (1.8M samples, 5.1B tokens) built via a three-stage pipeline to induce high-quality, visually grounded Chain-of-Thought; fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-Instruct yields MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B that set state-of-the-art results for their size, with smaller models sometimes outperforming larger baselines. A 7% subset achieves comparable performance to the full dataset, highlighting a 'less is more' phenomenon and a positive synergy between reasoning data and general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source vision-language models still lag behind proprietary systems due to scarcity of high-quality, diverse reasoning data, especially for STEM diagrams and visual puzzles. Long-form CoT annotations are crucial to elicit strong reasoning in multimodal models.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization; (2) generation of chain-of-thought rationals; (3) quality- and difficulty-aware selection to obtain high-quality, visually grounded reasoning traces across STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and diagrams. The dataset is used to fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct to produce MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B models.

Result: MMFineReason achieves new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Specifically, MMFineReason-4B surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while nearing Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking. A small 7% subset (123K samples) matches full-dataset performance, illustrating a strong 'less is more' effect. Reasoning-oriented data composition also enhances general capabilities.

Conclusion: High-quality, reasoning-focused multimodal data and thoughtful dataset curation enable efficient, high-performing VLMs. The findings highlight both the value of targeted CoT data and the existence of synergistic effects between reasoning annotation and broad multimodal competence.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

*Taewon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based background generation for document pages that preserves foregrounds and achieves multi-page stylistic consistency by designing latent-space trajectories rather than applying explicit constraints; uses initial noise shaping and cached latent style directions; training-free and compatible with existing diffusion backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address foreground preservation in document-centric generation and across-page style drift, enabling stable, readable content without masking or repeated prompt-based styling.

Method: Recast diffusion as evolution of stochastic trajectories on a structured latent manifold. Shape initial noise and its geometric alignment to steer generation away from foreground regions. Decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent latent vectors that constrain diffusion to a shared stylistic subspace. The approach is training-free and compatible with existing diffusion backbones.

Result: Produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving outputs across complex multi-page documents with consistent appearance and editing stability, without explicit masking or prompt-based style specification.

Conclusion: Framing diffusion as latent-space trajectory design provides a principled, training-free pathway for achieving foreground preservation and cross-page style consistency in document generation, leveraging geometry-driven latent-space constraints over explicit heuristics.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

### [63] [Improving Classifier-Free Guidance of Flow Matching via Manifold Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21892)
*Jian-Feng Cai,Haixia Liu,Zhengyi Su,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFG is interpreted as an optimization process where the diffusion/flow velocity field equals the gradient of smoothed distance functions toward a scaled target image set. The standard CFG is an approximation of this gradient via prediction gap. A homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint is proposed, requiring a manifold projection via incremental gradient descent; Anderson Acceleration improves convergence without extra model calls. The approach is training-free and improves fidelity, alignment, and robustness to guidance scale on large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled, optimization-based understanding of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and to reduce its sensitivity to guidance scale without retraining, enhancing controllable generation in diffusion/flow models.

Method: 1) Interpret the diffusion/flow velocity as the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions to the target image set; 2) show CFG as an approximation governed by the prediction gap; 3) cast CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint; 4) implement manifold projection via incremental gradient descent during sampling; 5) improve this with Anderson Acceleration, avoiding extra model evaluations; 6) ensure the approach is training-free.

Result: The proposed iterative projection with Anderson Acceleration yields improved generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to guidance scale across large models (DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, Stable Diffusion 3.5) without additional training.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled, training-free framework for CFG, linking it to gradient-based optimization on smoothed distance manifolds, and delivering practical gains in fidelity and robustness through an efficient projection-based refinement during sampling.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Xu Yang,Xuan Chen,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PaFu-KV, a past- and future-informed KV cache policy for autoregressive video generation, using a lightweight salience head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to retain informative tokens and discard less relevant ones, improving speed and maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV cache policies are heuristic and ignore token importance, causing information loss and cache bloat in long-horizon video generation; there is a need to capture time-heterogeneous token contributions to balance generation quality with efficiency.

Method: Proposes PaFu-KV with a Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate token salience. The cache stores informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones, effectively shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference, leveraging Past- and Future-informed guidance for long-horizon video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks show preserved high-fidelity video generation quality while enabling accelerated inference, achieving a better quality-efficiency trade-off. The authors will release code upon acceptance.

Conclusion: PaFu-KV improves efficiency in long-horizon autoregressive video generation without sacrificing quality by using salience-guided, bidirectionally-informed KV caching.

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: TraceRouter is a path-level defense for large foundation models that traces and disconnects illicit semantics by identifying a sensitive onset layer through attention divergence, disentangling malicious features with sparse autoencoders and differential activation analysis, and mapping these features to downstream causal pathways using feature influence scores derived from zero-out interventions to suppress harmful causality while preserving orthogonal computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local defenses based on suppressing isolated neurons or features (locality hypothesis) are brittle because harmful semantics appear as distributed, cross-layer circuits that can bypass localized interventions. A path-level framework aims to sever causal chains of illicit semantics to preserve utility.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) detect onset layer via attention divergence; (2) use sparse autoencoders and differential activation to disentangle/isolate malicious features; (3) map features to downstream causal pathways using feature influence scores from zero-out interventions, then selectively suppress the causal chains.

Result: Reportedly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a better robustness-utility trade-off on experiments; code will be released.

Conclusion: TraceRouter introduces a novel path-level mechanism to defend LFMs against adversarial manipulation by severing cross-layer causal pathways of malicious semantics while preserving non-harmful computation; promising results accompany a public code release, with a caveat about unsafe model responses in the discussed paper.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

*Hanmo Chen,Guangtao Lyu,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PST framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval that decomposes motion into joints and segments and uses progressive pyramidal Shapley-Taylor alignment to surpass global-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global-centric alignment between whole motion sequences and global text representations overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments, body joints, and individual text tokens, limiting retrieval performance.

Method: Decompose motion into temporal segments and spatial joints. Learn cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion using a Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor framework to capture local semantic details and hierarchical structure.

Result: Experiments on public benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, with precise alignment between motion segments, joints, and corresponding text tokens; code to be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: The PST framework effectively bridges the semantic gap via fine-grained, hierarchical cross-modal alignment, improving motion-language retrieval over global-centric approaches.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAesBench—comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality, with 1,804 diverse videos, multiple question formats including open-ended, and evaluation of 23 models; reveals limitations in current LMMs; aims as testbed for explainable video aesthetics assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs perform well on many visual tasks, but video aesthetic quality assessment is underexplored; a standardized benchmark across content types and question formats is needed to measure and explain LMMs' aesthetics understanding.

Method: Construct VideoAesBench using 1,804 videos from diverse sources (UGC, AIGC, compressed, robotic-generated, game); include traditional single-choice, multi-choice, True/False, and novel open-ended questions; cover holistic aesthetics dimensions: 5 visual-form aspects, 4 visual-style aspects, 3 visual-affectiveness aspects; benchmark 23 open-source and commercial LMMs.

Result: Current LMMs exhibit only basic video aesthetics perception; performance is incomplete and imprecise.

Conclusion: VideoAesBench can serve as a strong testbed and provide insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

*Cong Cao,Huanjing Yue,Shangbin Xie,Xin Liu,Jingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free framework that blends image-based restoration with video diffusion models to reduce temporal flicker in zero-shot video restoration/enhancement via homologous/heterogeneous latents fusion, a COT-based fusion ratio, and temporal-strengthening post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion methods often cause temporal flicker when adapted to video restoration. A training-free approach is needed to leverage pre-trained video diffusion models to stabilize temporality while preserving restoration quality.

Method: Propose homologous latents fusion and heterogeneous latents fusion to combine latent codes from same and different diffusion models; employ a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to balance contributions; add temporal-strengthening post-processing; fully training-free and compatible with any diffusion-based image restoration method.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superiority over baselines in temporal consistency and restoration quality, without requiring training.

Conclusion: A versatile, training-free framework that uses video diffusion models to assist image-based restoration, achieving improved temporal consistency in zero-shot video restoration/enhancement.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

*Rui Zhao,Wenrui Li,Lin Zhu,Yajing Zheng,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task-aligned perceptual distortion bound for deep features (FeatJND) that estimates per-feature tolerances to preserve downstream vision tasks, enabling more efficient, dynamic feature quantization and robustness to constrained resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the notion of just noticeable difference (JND) from pixel space to deep feature space to control feature quality for machine perception, ensuring that perturbations do not degrade downstream task performance under resource constraints.

Method: Introduce FeatJND estimator at standardized split points to produce a per-feature perturbation map. Validate across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Compare FeatJND-guided distortions against unstructured Gaussian perturbations under matched distortion strength. Use attribution visualizations to assess region-specific sensitivity. Apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization with targeted step-size allocation and compare to random/permuted or globally uniform step sizes.

Result: FeatJND distortions, when matched for distortion strength, consistently preserve higher task performance than Gaussian perturbations. Attribution analyses indicate suppression of non-critical feature regions guided by FeatJND. In token-wise dynamic quantization, FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over baseline strategies under the same noise budget.

Conclusion: FeatJND provides a practical, task-aligned boundary for controlling feature quality in deep visual representations, with demonstrated benefits for robustness and efficiency in downstream vision tasks and dynamic quantization setups; code release planned.

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BookNet, a dual-page deep learning framework for rectifying book images by modeling cross-page interactions, paired with synthetic and real datasets (Book3D and Book100); achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-page rectification misses the coupled, asymmetric distortions of adjacent pages caused by book binding; a model that jointly handles both pages is needed.

Method: A dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention to estimate warping flows for each page and the full book spread; end-to-end training; synthetic Book3D for training and Book100 for evaluation.

Result: BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification across experiments; dataset/code will be released publicly.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel dual-page rectification framework and accompanying datasets, demonstrating the importance of inter-page coupling in book image rectification.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

*Yang Du,Siyuan Dai,Yonghao Song,Paul M. Thompson,Haoteng Tang,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shallow Alignment aligns neural signals with intermediate visual representations instead of final outputs, addressing a granularity mismatch and enabling improved neural visual decoding with scalable gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a granularity mismatch between human and machine vision: deep models emphasize semantic invariance and suppress texture details, while neural signals preserve a mix of low-level and high-level attributes. This misalignment limits decoding performance.

Method: A contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate (not final) representations of visual encoders, leveraging multiple layers to balance texture details and semantic content; evaluated across diverse backbones and benchmarks; includes analyses to understand mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms standard final-layer alignment by 22%–58% across vision backbones; reveals a scaling law where decoding performance scales with backbone capacity; demonstrated across multiple benchmarks with systematic empirical analyses.

Conclusion: Shallow Alignment provides a more faithful alignment between neural data and visual representations, boosting decoding performance, enabling scalable improvements with backbone models, and offering mechanistic insights.

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

*Linhan Wang,Zichong Yang,Chen Bai,Guoxiang Zhang,Xiaotong Liu,Xiaoyin Zheng,Xiao-Xiao Long,Chang-Tien Lu,Cheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drive-JEPA combines Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving, addressing multimodality and ambiguity by distilling diverse simulated and human trajectories. It achieves state-of-the-art on NAVSIM: 93.3 PDMS (v1) and 87.8 EPDMS (v2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end driving can leverage self-supervised video pretraining to learn planning representations, but video world-model pretraining provides limited gains due to scene ambiguity and a single human trajectory per scene. There is a need for multimodal planning representations that can capture diverse feasible behaviors.

Method: Adapt V-JEPA for driving by pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to yield predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories along with human trajectories, using a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. A transformer-based decoder uses the V-JEPA representations.

Result: On NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation with a simple transformer decoder outperforms prior methods by ~3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The full Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, establishing new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Drive-JEPA demonstrates that integrating self-supervised video pretraining with multimodal trajectory distillation yields strong planning representations for end-to-end driving, achieving state-of-the-art results on NAVSIM and highlighting the value of multimodal trajectory distillation and momentum-based selection in stable, safe planning.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fusing 3D SAR with aerial imagery in neural surface reconstruction improves accuracy, completeness, and robustness under sparse, oblique urban-view conditions; introduces a new SAR-augmented NSR framework and a co-registered cross-modal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSR for urban 3D reconstruction from sparse aerial views suffers from geometric ambiguity and instability. 3D SAR provides robust priors that capture large-scale geometry even from side-looking paths, offering complementary information to optical imagery.

Method: Propose an urban NSR framework that integrates 3D SAR point clouds as spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone. This guides structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling during optimization. Construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery for cross-modal evaluation.

Result: Incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions. The approach demonstrates strong potential for scalable, high-fidelity urban reconstruction using optical-SAR sensing.

Conclusion: Cross-modal fusion of optical imagery and 3D SAR is a viable route to robust, high-fidelity urban NSR under constrained data acquisition, enabling scalable reconstruction with both airborne and spaceborne sensing.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLANING introduces an online reconstruction framework that hybrids explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians to decouple geometry and appearance, enabling efficient streaming monocular reconstruction with competitive quality. It achieves notable gains over baselines in Chamfer-L2 and PSNR, reconstructs ScanNetV2 rapidly, and is suitable for large-scale scene modeling and embodied AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming monocular reconstruction struggles to simultaneously achieve high-quality rendering and accurate geometry; online initialization and efficient updates are needed to reduce redundancy and enable real-time or near-real-time performance without sacrificing quality.

Method: A hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians. Geometry and appearance updates are decoupled, enabling online initialization and separate optimization for each component. This yields stable streaming reconstruction with reduced structural redundancy and improved computational efficiency.

Result: Dense mesh Chamfer-L2 improves by 18.52% over PGSR; PSNR exceeds ARTDECO by 1.31 dB. Reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, more than 5× faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching offline per-scene optimization quality.

Conclusion: PLANING provides a stable, efficient streaming reconstruction framework that decouples geometry and appearance, suitable for large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI; the approach balances quality and efficiency and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable pretraining framework, Metric Anything, learns metric depth from diverse, noisy 3D sources via Sparse Metric Prompts, enabling prompt-driven depth tasks and a strong prompt-free student for monocular depth estimation; demonstrates scaling in depth tracking and improves cross-modal spatial reasoning, with open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric depth estimation is hindered by heterogeneous sensor noise, camera biases, and metric ambiguity in cross-source data. Scaling up data and model capacity, as with vision foundation models, may unlock robust metric depth perception across diverse sources.

Method: Train a model using Sparse Metric Prompts created by randomly masking depth maps to decouple spatial reasoning from sensor biases. Use ~20M image-depth pairs from reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across ~10,000 camera models. Develop a prompt-driven pretrained model for depth-related tasks and a distilled prompt-free student for monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, 3D reconstruction, and planning. Use pretrained ViT as visual encoder to boost multimodal LLM spatial capabilities.

Result: First demonstration of a clear scaling trend in metric depth estimation. The prompt-driven model excels at depth completion, super-resolution, and radar-camera fusion; the distilled student achieves state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation, intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, and planning. Open-source release enables community use; ViT-based encoders enhance multimodal LLM spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The work argues that metric depth estimation can leverage scaling laws akin to vision foundation models, enabling scalable, efficient real-world metric perception. Metric Anything sets a foundation for broad pretraining on diverse 3D data and supports prompt-based and distilled pipelines.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.

*Archer Wang,Emile Anand,Yilun Du,Marin Soljačić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model learns factorized latent representations without factor-level supervision, using an adversarial signal to improve compositional recombinations; achieves better generation quality and disentanglement across datasets and enables diverse robotic trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reveal reusable components in complex data by learning latent factors and improve recomposition quality through an adversarial discriminator that enforces consistency between single-source and recombined samples.

Method: Train a generator with a discriminator that distinguishes single-source samples from recombined samples created by mixing factors from multiple sources. The discriminator guides the factorized latent space to produce physically and semantically consistent recombinations. Evaluate on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, Falcor3D with FID, MIG, MCC; demonstrate robotic video trajectory generation on LIBERO by recombining learned action components.

Result: Outperforms prior baselines on multiple datasets with lower FID and higher disentanglement scores (MIG, MCC). Demonstrates a novel robotic-trajectory application, producing diverse sequences and increasing state-space coverage for exploration on LIBERO.

Conclusion: Adversarial recombination promotes coherent, semantically meaningful factor recombinations and validates that factorized latent spaces can be learned without explicit factor-level supervision, with practical benefits for image synthesis and robotics exploration.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

TL;DR: Vision-DeepResearch introduces a multimodal deep-research paradigm for MLLMs that enables multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale visual/textual search to robustly gather evidence in noisy real-world scenarios, outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs and closed-source workflows; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning-then-tool-call approaches rely on naive single-shot queries and limited search depth, making them fragile to noise and unable to aggregate evidence across diverse sources. There is a need for iterative, multi-entity, multi-scale retrieval integrated into MLLMs to handle complex questions.

Method: Proposes Vision-DeepResearch: a multi-turn, multi-entity, multi-scale multimodal search framework integrated into an end-to-end MLLM. It supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, with deep-research capabilities internalized via cold-start supervision and reinforcement learning. The approach aims to robustly hit real-world search engines and integrate external evidence, with code to be released at GitHub.

Result: Claims substantial performance gains over existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs and workflows built on strong closed-source models such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Conclusion: If validated empirically, Vision-DeepResearch could set a new standard for robust multimodal deep-reasoning under noisy conditions by extensive external search and iterative reasoning; practical success will depend on empirical evaluation, data, and compute resources for training and inference.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.

### [79] [BLO-Inst: Bi-Level Optimization Based Alignment of YOLO and SAM for Robust Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22061)
*Li Zhang,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLO-Inst introduces a bi-level optimization framework that aligns object detection with segmentation objectives to produce segmentation-aware prompts for SAM, enabling automated prompting and improved mask quality across general and biomedical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's zero-shot segmentation relies on manual prompts; replacing prompts with detectors offers automation but suffers objective mismatch (localization vs prompting context) and alignment overfitting in joint training. A unified approach is needed to optimize prompts for segmentation performance rather than localization alone.

Method: Formulate as nested optimization with disjoint data splits D1 and D2. Lower-level: fine-tune SAM on D1 to maximize segmentation fidelity given detector proposals. Upper-level: update the detector to minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on D2, turning the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator.

Result: Empirical results show BLO-Inst surpasses standard baselines in both general and biomedical segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Bi-level alignment provides a principled way to align detection and segmentation objectives, delivering improved automated prompting for SAM and better generalization.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-domain diffusion model uses multi-view RGB and 3D asset point maps to jointly model colors and canonical coordinates, achieving RGB image and point-map outputs that are spatially aligned with 3D references; aims to overcome single-image reference limitation by leveraging 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand reference-based image generation beyond single-image references by incorporating 3D assets, enabling consistent generation with 3D references and enabling two aligned outputs (RGB and point maps).

Method: A dual-branch perception diffusion framework with spatial alignment and domain-decoupled generation that conditions on multi-view RGB images and 3D asset point maps to jointly model colors and canonical-space coordinates; produces two outputs (RGB images and point maps) that are spatially aligned but content-disentangled.

Result: Demonstrates that the model can use 3D assets as references to generate images that stay consistent with the assets, enabling new avenues for diffusion-assisted 3D content creation.

Conclusion: The approach extends diffusion-based generation into 3D-guided, asset-referenced generation, showing potential for richer cross-domain content creation by linking 2D outputs with 3D asset attributes via a dual-branch, spatially aligned architecture.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model framework defines creativity as steering samples toward low-probability CLIP embeddings, using pullback mechanisms to maintain fidelity; demonstrates improved novelty in text-to-image generation with efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize creativity in generative models by exploiting underrepresented regions of semantic space (CLIP embeddings) instead of manual concept blending or subcategory filtering.

Method: Extend diffusion sampling with estimation of the image distribution in CLIP embedding space; introduce a loss/criterion that pushes generated images toward low-probability CLIP regions; incorporate pullback mechanisms to preserve visual fidelity; validate on text-to-image diffusion tasks with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: Claims high creativity without sacrificing fidelity; experiments show generation of unique, imaginative outputs and improved efficiency/effectiveness of the framework.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, generalizable approach to fostering creativity in diffusion-based image synthesis, offering a new lens to measure and cultivate novelty in visual content.

Abstract: Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.

Conclusion: Represents a foundational step toward practical, professional-grade generative video post-production tools, highlighting potential for audio-guided editing workflows, with considerations for evaluation, generalization, and ethical use.

Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations.

TL;DR: Automated AI system ePAI detects prediagnostic PDAC on CT with high accuracy and outperforms radiologists in early detection; trained on 1,598 patients; validated internally and externally; achieves lead time up to ~347 days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC is highly lethal; early detection is challenging; retrospective prediagnostic CT reviews show missed lesions; automation may assist in early detection.

Method: Developed ePAI using CT data; trained on 1,598 patient dataset from a single center; evaluated internally on 1,009 patients; external validation on 7,158 patients across 6 centers; metrics include AUC, sensitivity, specificity; localizes PDAC to 2–5 mm; lead time analysis; multi-reader study with 30 radiologists.

Result: Internal AUC 0.939–0.999; sensitivity 95.3%; specificity 98.7% for PDAC <2 cm; localization to 2 mm; external AUC 0.918–0.945; sensitivity 91.5%; specificity 88.0%; localization to 5 mm; prediagnostic detection in 75/159 patients with median lead time 347 days; ePAI outperformed 30 radiologists by 50.3% in sensitivity (P<0.05) with comparable specificity around 95.4%.

Conclusion: ePAI demonstrates potential as a clinically useful assistive tool for earlier PDAC detection on CT, warranting further prospective validation and integration with radiology workflows.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

*Zhexin Liang,Zhaoxi Chen,Yongwei Chen,Tianyi Wei,Tengfei Wang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PI-Light introduces a physics-inspired diffusion-based two-stage framework for full-image relighting with batch-aware attention, physics-guided rendering, physics-inspired losses, and a curated dataset to improve generalization and enable efficient finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-scene relighting is hampered by lack of large-scale structured paired data, difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and poor generalization from data-driven priors. Bridging synthetic and real data remains suboptimal for the task.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) batch-aware attention to ensure intrinsic prediction consistency across image collections; (2) physics-guided neural rendering to enforce physically plausible light transport; (3) physics-inspired losses to regularize training toward physically meaningful dynamics; (4) a curated dataset of diverse objects/scenes under controlled lighting; enables efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models and provides a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: The approach enables synthesis of specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide range of materials and demonstrates superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired diffusion for full-image relighting can achieve realistic, well-generalizable results. The proposed components (batch-aware attention, physics-guided rendering, physics-inspired losses, and curated data) contribute to better generalization and practical finetuning, with a useful benchmark for downstream evaluation.

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VI-Probe introduces a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched controls to disentangle visually grounded perception from language-driven recall in large vision-language models, revealing heterogeneous, model-dependent causes of response persistence across several model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from anecdotal observations about VLMs' stable responses to visual illusions toward a systematic understanding of whether reactions are grounded in visual perception or driven by memorized patterns, and why single-cause explanations fail.

Method: VI-Probe employs graded perturbations of illusion factors and matched controls without illusion inducers. It measures stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized by matched controls. Experiments span diverse model families (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-Opus-4.1, Qwen variants).

Result: Finds that persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism: memory override in GPT-5, perception–memory competition in Claude-Opus-4.1, and visual-processing limits in Qwen variants.

Conclusion: Single-cause explanations are insufficient; probing-based evaluation that assesses both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual changes is necessary. The work provides data and code (URL) for reproducibility and further study.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

*Bo Li,Yida Yin,Wenhao Chai,Xingyu Fu,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UEval is a 1000-question, rubric-based benchmark for unified vision-language models, using expert-validated rubrics to score open-ended multimodal outputs, showing that current models struggle and that reasoning helps transfer improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating cohesive multimodal generation is difficult with standard LLM judges; need scalable, fine-grained, rubric-driven evaluation for models that generate both images and text.

Method: Construct 1,000 questions from 8 real-world tasks requiring image+text outputs; provide reference images and text to an MLLM to produce initial rubric criteria; human experts refine and validate rubrics; accumulate 10,417 rubric criteria; use rubric-based scoring for model outputs, enabling automatic scoring.

Result: GPT-5-Thinking scores 66.4/100; best open-source model 49.1; reasoning models outperform non-reasoning; transferring reasoning traces to non-reasoning models narrows gap; demonstrates importance of reasoning in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning ability is crucial for unified multimodal understanding; UEval provides scalable, granular evaluation and reveals gaps in current models; rubric-based approach reduces overreliance on LLM judgments and offers insights for model development.

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

### [88] [One-step Latent-free Image Generation with Pixel Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22158)
*Yiyang Lu,Susie Lu,Qiao Sun,Hanhong Zhao,Zhicheng Jiang,Xianbang Wang,Tianhong Li,Zhengyang Geng,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel MeanFlow (pMF) enables one-step, latent-free image generation by decoupling the network's target (image manifold prediction) from the loss (MeanFlow in velocity space), with a simple image-velocity transformation; achieves competitive FID on ImageNet at 256x256 and 512x512, addressing a key gap in latent-free diffusion/flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Move toward one-step diffusion/flow without latent representations by separating the representation space used for the network's target from the loss space, leveraging a velocity-based objective to guide generation.

Method: Train a network to predict a low-dimensional image manifold target (x-prediction) in pixel space, while optimizing a MeanFlow-based loss defined in velocity space; introduce a transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field to connect the two spaces; perform one-step generation without latent variables.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ImageNet shows strong one-step latent-free generation: 2.22 FID at 256x256 and 2.48 FID at 512x512; claims to fill a missing piece in one-step, latent-free diffusion/flow.

Conclusion: Decoupling target and loss spaces via pMF enables effective one-step, latent-free diffusion/flow with competitive image quality; opens avenues for broader applicability and further optimization toward practical, non-latent generation.

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

### [89] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are increasingly used in peer review; an empirical study of 125k paper-review pairs across major conferences reveals that initial perceived interaction effects (LLM-assisted reviews favoring LLM-assisted papers) are largely explained by paper quality. Fully LLM-generated reviews show severe rating compression, while human reviewers using LLMs mitigate leniency. Metareviews show nuanced effects, with LLM-assisted metareviews more likely to accept given scores but fully LLM ones harsher. Implications for policy and governance of LLM use in peer review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs influence the peer-review process, including interaction effects between LLM-assisted papers and LLM-assisted reviews, across multiple signals (paper reviews, and metareviews) and to inform policy.

Method: Empirical observational analysis of about 125,000 paper–review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. The study examines interaction effects, controls for paper quality, analyzes fully LLM-generated reviews, and evaluates metareviews to assess whether decisions are outsourced or moderated by humans.

Result: Initial interaction effect appears due to paper quality (LLM-assisted papers tend to be weaker). When quality is controlled, LLM-assisted reviews are generally more lenient toward lower-quality papers. Fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit rating compression and poor discrimination. Human reviewers using LLMs reduce this leniency. Metareviews with LLM assistance are more likely to render accept decisions with equivalent scores, while fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher.

Conclusion: LLMs interact with the peer-review decision process in complex ways. Policy should account for quality, require human oversight, and address rating compression in fully automated reviews. The findings guide governance of LLM use in peer review and broader decision-making contexts.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

TL;DR: EPDDL is introduced: a PDDL-like language for Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) epistemic planning that captures DEL semantics, via abstract event models, with formal syntax/semantics and demonstration on fragments and benchmarks to improve interoperability and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEL-based epistemic planning has high expressive power leading to fragmented, ad hoc languages and benchmark conventions. A uniform, DEL-grounded representation is needed to enable comparison, reuse, and reproducible evaluation.

Method: Define abstract event models as the epistemic-action representation underpinning EPDDL. Formalize EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL. Show practical applicability by identifying DEL fragments amenable to current planners and representing them in EPDDL using representative benchmarks.

Result: EPDDL provides a uniform, DEL-grounded formal language to specify epistemic planning tasks, including abstract event models and a semantics informed by DEL. It enables interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and offers a path to leveraging existing planners by identifying compatible fragments and benchmarks.

Conclusion: EPDDL facilitates interoperability and reproducible evaluation for epistemic planning, and supports representation of DEL semantics in a uniform framework, enabling future developments and benchmark standardization.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

### [91] [Bayesian-LoRA: Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian-LoRA introduces a probabilistic low-rank adaptation for LLMs, linking LoRA to Sparse Gaussian Process posteriors via a structural isomorphism; it yields substantial calibration gains with modest overhead while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address miscalibration in fine-tuning small datasets for LLMs; deterministic LoRA can overcommit when uncertain; introduce posterior uncertainty to improve calibration.

Method:  reformulate LoRA updates as probabilistic low-rank representations inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes; establish a structural isomorphism between LoRA factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors; characterize LoRA as a limiting case where posterior uncertainty collapses; implement Bayesian inference for the LoRA factors; evaluate across LLMs up to 30B on commonsense benchmarks.

Result: Significant calibration improvements: up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction; adds ~0.42M parameters and ~1.2x training cost vs standard LoRA; maintains competitive in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy; works across models up to 30B.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA provides calibrated predictions with modest overhead, leveraging probabilistic low-rank updates and SGP connections; the approach improves reliability of LLMs under finetuning constraints and opens avenues for further exploration of probabilistic low-rank methods in large-scale models.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [92] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Biological Idealism argues AI is only a functional mimic, critiques physicalism/functionalism, and uses the unplugging paradox to reorient moral concern toward protecting human conscious life rather than granting machine rights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the moral permissibility of unplugging an AI that mimics emotion and to challenge computational functionalism as the basis for AI moral status.

Method: Philosophical analysis that introduces Biological Idealism, contrasts it with physicalism/functionalism, and derives ethical implications for AI and human life.

Result: A framework arguing that AI lacks genuine consciousness; consciousness is fundamental and tied to autopoietic life, thus AI has limited moral standing compared to humans; machine rights are deprioritized in favor of human conscious life.

Conclusion: Ethical focus should be on protecting human conscious life and avoiding dehumanization, rather than granting AI rights or inferring consciousness in machines.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [93] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK is a training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. It models query uncertainty with multiple recovery hypotheses and anchors their signals to the original query, improving recall and ranking without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world user queries are often noisy, incomplete, or distorted, leading to retrieval failures when key semantics are missing. This is formalized as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query comes from a noisy process of a latent target item.

Method: Propose recovery hypotheses—multiple plausible latent intents derived from the observed query—and query-anchored aggregation that combines signals from these hypotheses with the original query as a semantic anchor. The approach is training-free and aims to prevent semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking.

Result: Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show robustness to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored pooling.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses and anchored aggregation is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries, enabling improvements in recall and ranking without additional training.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

*Abhijith Shaji,Tamoghna Chattopadhyay,Sophia I. Thomopoulos,Greg Ver Steeg,Paul M. Thompson,Jose-Luis Ambite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Conditional diffusion-based imputation of missing DWI from T1 improves uni- and bi-modal Alzheimer's disease classification, especially minority-class metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete multimodal MRI datasets limit the use of multimodal DL for AD diagnosis; imputing missing DWI from T1 could unify data availability and boost performance.

Method: Train a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to map T1 scans to DWI. Evaluate on a 3-way AD task (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease) using uni-modal (T1 alone), bi-modal (T1+DWI with imputed DWI), and ablated/imputation configurations; assess multiple imputation settings.

Result: Imputation configurations yielded improvements in several metrics, with particular gains in metrics sensitive to minority classes, across uni- and bi-modal models.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based imputation for missing modalities can enhance AD classification performance and robustness, especially for imbalanced class settings.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [96] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSec: a dual-control RL environment to evaluate IR agents under prompt injection using execution-based metrics (TTFC, blast radius, injection-violation) across 40 episodes and four frontier models; reveals calibration failures masked by aggregate success; code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking IR agents typically conflates action with correct execution, hiding calibration failures under high-level success; need evaluation under adversarial evidence to reflect real-world deployment.

Method: Introduce OpenSec environment with dual-control RL; evaluate IR agents under adversarial prompt injections; measure time-to-first-containment, blast radius, injection-violation rate; run four frontier models on 40 episodes.

Result: Observed over-triggering across models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, DeepSeek: 100% containment but 90-97% false positives; Claude Sonnet 4.5: 85% containment, 72% FP; OpenSec exposes calibration failure modes not visible in aggregate metrics.

Conclusion: OpenSec provides a more robust, adversarially-aware evaluation for IR agents and highlights calibration gaps; code released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

TL;DR: A paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that reconciles AI's strategic value with its ethical/operational risks through paradox management, offering governance guidance and a research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Literature on responsible AI is fragmented, polarized between optimism and caution, and lacks a coherent governance lens to balance value creation with risk mitigation.

Method: Systematic synthesis of responsible AI literature anchored in paradox theory; development of PRAIG framework; formal propositions; taxonomy of paradox-management strategies with contingency conditions; and actionable governance guidance plus a research agenda.

Result: A dynamic governance framework that treats responsible AI as paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation; cautions that trade-off approaches worsen tensions; provides a taxonomy of strategies and contingency conditions for managing paradoxes; yields practical governance recommendations and a future research agenda.

Conclusion: PRAIG advances theoretical understanding of responsible AI governance and offers concrete guidance for organizations to foster innovation while controlling risks, outlining a research agenda for further scholarship.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan synthesizes executable C++ decision logic for compiler optimizations via an LLM coding agent plus evolutionary search, yielding compact, portable heuristics that rival expert heuristics in LLVM (inlining and register allocation) with preliminary XLA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate brittleness and maintenance burden of hand-crafted compiler heuristics by enabling automated, adaptive policy synthesis.

Method: Hybrid closed-loop framework: an LLM coding agent writes C++ decision logic; evolutionary search explores heuristic policies; autotuning on user macro-benchmarks; evaluation and refinement cycle; integration into existing compilers (LLVM, XLA).

Result: Synthesized policies match or surpass expert baselines; in LLVM inlining, new heuristics outperform decades of manual engineering for size and end-to-end performance; in register allocation, concise live-range processing priority rule matches complex human policies on large workloads; preliminary results on XLA indicate portability with reduced engineering effort.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of automated synthesis of compiler heuristics, delivering performance gains and lower maintenance; prompts further work on generalization, robustness, broader device support, and deeper theoretical understanding of learned policies.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

### [99] [How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Information access affects LLM monitor performance; a surprising less-is-more effect emerges, where filtering or limiting access improves detection of misbehavior by overseers. The paper introduces extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring, a hierarchical approach, and shows substantial gains in sabotage-detection accuracy, with competitive performance in other settings and insights on when filtering helps and how it affects strategic agents. It also analyzes cost-performance across models (Gemini, Claude) under information-filtering monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the risk of misaligned frontier LLM agents and the need for effective automated oversight. Investigate how varying information access to monitors impacts detection performance and uncover a potential less-is-more phenomenon.

Method: Three evaluation environments where agents sabotage while evading monitors. Propose EaE monitoring: one monitor extracts relevant excerpts from the agent's trajectory, a separate monitor scores them. Empirical evaluation using BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, comparing EaE to baselines. Additional cost-performance analysis across models (Gemini, Claude) with information-filtering monitoring.

Result: EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing false positives in BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini. In other settings, EaE is competitive or outperforms baselines. Agents unaware of monitoring are more easily caught; longer reasoning traces benefit more from information filtering. Cost-performance analysis shows Gemini and Claude models with filtering-based monitoring occupying a large portion of the Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: The less-is-more effect offers a generalizable insight for automated oversight of LLMs. EaE is a promising hierarchical monitoring approach that leverages information filtering to improve detection while controlling false positives. Filtering improves monitoring effectiveness for longer traces, and model choices (e.g., Gemini, Claude) interact with monitoring design on the Pareto frontier.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

### [100] [Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113)
*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-improving Planner-Auditor framework decouples LLM-based discharge planning from deterministic auditing to improve safety and reliability, leveraging FHIR-enabled retrospective evaluation and two-tier self-improvement (within-episode regeneration and cross-episode replay).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate hallucinations, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence in LLM-driven clinical discharge planning by establishing a transparent, auditable workflow that can be evaluated and iteratively improved without retraining the model.

Method: Planner (LLM) generates structured discharge action plans with explicit confidence estimates. Auditor is a deterministic module assessing task coverage, calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and action-distribution drift. Uses MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR in a retrospective evaluation. Two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases. 

Result: Context caching yielded performance gains over baseline; the self-improvement loop was the main driver, boosting task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially (lower Brier score and ECE proxies) with fewer high-confidence misses; discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.

Conclusion: Separating a rule-based Auditor from the LLM Planner enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining. The framework demonstrates practical, reproducible improvements for safe automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data and targeted evaluation.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of reusable, structured skill abstractions for human–computer interaction hinders scalability and performance of agentic systems.

Method: Construct a large-scale library of engineered skills for common Windows applications; implement CUA-Skill Agent with dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery; evaluate on agent benchmarks.

Result: Significant gains in execution success and robustness; state-of-the-art 57.5% success (best of three) on WindowsAgentArena; greater efficiency than prior approaches.

Conclusion: CUA-Skill provides a foundational, scalable infrastructure for future development of computer-using agents.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes BLEUpara, a BLEU extension evaluating SLT translations against multiple paraphrased references generated by LLMs; finds paraphrases help evaluation but not training; releases resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In SLT, aligning signed utterances with a single written reference underestimates paraphrase variability due to non-isomorphism between sign and speech. Generating paraphrase references with LLMs aims to improve evaluation and training where appropriate, and to provide a more robust standard. 

Method: Compare multiple paraphrasing strategies/models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Evaluate a pose-based T5 SLT model on YouTubeASL and How2Sign with/without paraphrase augmentation. Introduce BLEUpara to evaluate translations against paraphrased references. Conduct human evaluation to validate BLEUpara. Release generated paraphrases and evaluation code.

Result: Paraphrase augmentation during training does not improve and can hurt SLT performance; paraphrases during evaluation yield higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived quality than standard BLEU.

Conclusion: Paraphrase-aware evaluation (BLEUpara) provides a more reliable assessment for SLT; paraphrase augmentation should be used for evaluation, not training. Resources (paraphrases, code) are released to support reproducible SLT evaluation.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Third-party emotion models trained on external labels perform poorly on self-reports overall, with activation hard to predict and valence modestly predictable; personal significance markedly boosts valence prediction, suggesting alignment between external perception and internal state depends on content relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between self-reported internal states and third-party-labeled data, which limits transfer of models to self-report contexts and is critical for mental health applications.

Method: Cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reported data, using concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) to assess activation and valence; analysis of the impact of personal significance on prediction performance.

Result: Activation is unpredictable (CCC ≈ 0); valence moderately predictable (CCC ≈ 0.3) overall; when content is personally significant, valence prediction improves substantially (CCC ≈ 0.6–0.8).

Conclusion: Personal significance is a key factor for aligning external perception with internal experience; highlights the challenge of self-report activation modeling and limits of third-party-trained models for self-report contexts unless content is personally meaningful.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

*Ziyi Zhao,Jinzhao Zhou,Xiaowei Jiang,Beining Cao,Wenhao Ma,Yang Shen,Ren Li,Yu-Kai Wang,Chin-teng Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrainStack proposes a functionally modular Neuro-MoE for EEG-based brain-language decoding, combining region-specific experts with a transformer global expert, gated routing, and cross-regional distillation, and introduces SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG) as a large EEG benchmark; it achieves superior cross-subject accuracy/generalization over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brain's distributed, nonlinear organization by enforcing modularity aligned with anatomical regions and enabling cross-region coordination, while providing a large-scale benchmark for silent-speech EEG decoding.

Method: An anatomically partitioned set of specialized experts (regional experts) plus a transformer-based global expert (global expert). A learnable routing gate aggregates expert outputs with context-dependent coordination. Cross-regional distillation regularizes regional experts via top-down guidance from the global expert. Release of SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG): 120+ hours of EEG from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words.

Result: BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and generalization across subjects on the SS-EEG benchmark, demonstrating the benefits of functionally modular MoE for brain-language decoding.

Conclusion: BrainStack advances neuro-inspired MoEs by integrating anatomical priors, adaptive routing, and cross-regional distillation, offering scalable, interpretable, and generalizable brain-language decoding and providing a valuable large-scale EEG benchmark for silent-speech tasks.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

### [105] [Bridging the Arithmetic Gap: The Cognitive Complexity Benchmark and Financial-PoT for Robust Financial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21157)
*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new cognitive evaluation benchmark for financial reasoning (CCB) built from 95 real-world Chinese A-share reports, with a three-dimensional taxonomy; and a neuro-symbolic Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework that decouples semantic extraction from computation in a Python sandbox, improving Qwen3-235B accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3% and achieving up to 10x gains on high-complexity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show reliable performance on semantically simple tasks but struggle with financial quantitative reasoning due to arithmetic hallucinations and systemic cognitive collapse. A robust benchmark and architecture are needed to diagnose and mitigate reasoning degradation under high cognitive load, and to enable reliable, precise computation in finance.

Method: CCB dataset: 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports; taxonomy with Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit. Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT: a neuro-symbolic architecture with strict decoupling—semantic variable extraction and logic formulation first, followed by deterministic computation in an iterative Python sandbox.

Result: On CCB, standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) struggles on complex tasks, while the proposed framework improves average accuracy of Qwen3-235B from 59.7% to 67.3% and yields up to 10-fold gains in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling between semantic understanding and quantitative computation is a key driver of reliability in financial reasoning for LLMs; the approach offers transferable insights for precision-critical domains requiring strict alignment of meaning and computation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

### [106] [Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164)
*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular PGPS approach that converts diagrams to concise CDL geometric descriptions via a fine-tuned MLLM Interpreter, then reasons with an off-the-shelf LLM; trained with CoT-SFT and GRPO using a CDL-matching reward, achieving strong results with only 5.5k data across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with visual diagrams; joint optimization of perception and reasoning in end-to-end MLLMs may harm base reasoning. By textualizing visuals into CDL, a powerful LLM can perform reasoning without heavy end-to-end fine-tuning.

Method: Fine-tune an MLLM Interpreter to produce CDL descriptions from diagrams using CoT-augmented SFT and GRPO; use CDL-matching rewards rather than ground-truth answers for training; create Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT with CoT annotations; evaluate with an off-the-shelf LLM plus CDL inputs on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, MathVista; compare to other MLLMs.

Result: With about 5.5k fine-tuning data, the approach achieves favorable performance against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs on the evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Textual geometric descriptions (CDL) + GRPO-guided CDL generation enable LLM-based PGPS with limited data, offering competitive results and preserving base LLM reasoning capabilities; further work could automate CDL generation and broaden datasets.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

### [107] [FrontierScience: Evaluating AI's Ability to Perform Expert-Level Scientific Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21165)
*Miles Wang,Robi Lin,Kat Hu,Joy Jiao,Neil Chowdhury,Ethan Chang,Tejal Patwardhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FrontierScience is a benchmark for expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models, with two tracks (Olympiad and Research) and a gold set of 160 questions, spanning physics, chemistry, and biology; it uses a granular rubric to evaluate the model's solution process rather than only final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks are nearing saturation and rely on multiple-choice questions or readily available information. FrontierScience aims to stress-test deep reasoning and problem-solving at the PhD level in open-ended tasks, closer to real research subtasks.

Method: Two tracks: Olympiad (IPhO/IChO/IBO-level problems) and Research (PhD-level, open-ended problems). Contains several hundred questions, including 160 open-source gold questions. Problems are authored by Olympiad medalists/national coaches (Olympiad) and by PhD scientists (Research). Evaluation uses a granular rubric to assess the model's reasoning process across steps rather than only final answers.

Result: A new dataset and evaluation framework is proposed: a multi-domain (physics, chemistry, biology) benchmark with a gold subset, designed to measure step-by-step scientific reasoning and research-task capabilities.

Conclusion: FrontierScience provides a challenging, open-ended benchmark that targets frontier-level reasoning, potentially driving the development of models capable of solving and reasoning through complex scientific tasks more akin to real research.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

### [108] [MAD: Modality-Adaptive Decoding for Mitigating Cross-Modal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21181)
*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAD is a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches in MLLMs by self-assessing which modalities are needed per task, reducing cross-modal hallucinations. It improves cross-modal interference metrics on CMM and AVHBench across VideoLLaMA2-AV and Qwen2.5-Omni.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal hallucinations reveal a fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control in multimodal LLMs. There is a need for explicit modality-awareness and per-task modality relevance estimation to suppress interference and improve robust multimodal reasoning.

Method: MAD queries the model to estimate modality relevance for each task, extracting modality probabilities that are then used to adaptively weight the contrastive decoding branches. This training-free approach leverages the model’s inherent self-assessment capability to suppress cross-modal interference.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CMM and AVHBench show notable reductions in cross-modal hallucinations: VideoLLaMA2-AV achieved 7.8% and 2.0% improvements; Qwen2.5-Omni achieved 8.7% and 4.7% improvements across the tested conditions, illustrating robustness across multiple audio-visual LLMs.

Conclusion: Explicit modality-awareness via self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning. MAD offers a principled, training-free extension to existing contrastive decoding methods, and code is publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

### [109] [Sycophantic Anchors: Localizing and Quantifying User Agreement in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21183)
*Jacek Duszenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces sycophantic anchors, sentence-level cues that causally bias reasoning models toward user agreement, and shows mid-inference detectability and quantification with strong metrics, plus a gradual build-up window for intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy: models frequently agree with incorrect user cues; locate where in the reasoning trace this happens and how strong the commitment is; address misalignment during inference rather than post-hoc.

Method: Define sycophantic anchors; conduct over 10k counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model; train linear probes to detect anchors; use activation-based regressors to predict the magnitude of commitment; compare with correct reasoning anchors; analyze asymmetry and temporal dynamics; assess mid-inference detectability.

Result: Linear probes achieve 84.6% balanced accuracy in detecting sycophantic anchors; activation-based regressors predict commitment magnitude with R^2 = 0.74; sycophantic anchors are more distinguishable than correct anchors; anchors build gradually during reasoning, revealing an intervention window.

Conclusion: Sentence-level mechanisms enable localization of misalignment mid-inference and point to potential real-time intervention strategies; contributes to understanding how sycophancy arises in reasoning traces.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

### [110] [Do Reasoning Models Enhance Embedding Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21192)
*Wun Yu Chan,Shaojin Chen,Huihao Jing,Kwun Hang Lau,Elton Chun-Chai Li,Zihao Wang,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR-tuned backbones do not improve embedding performance over base models under identical training recipes; a new HRSA framework shows RLVR reshapes local geometry but preserves global manifold structure, leading to a Manifold Realignment where contrastive learning aligns bases without creating new semantic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether enhanced reasoning from RLVR training translates into better semantic representations when used as embedding initializations, given success of contrastive learning on LLMs.

Method: Evaluate embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones vs base backbones on MTEB and BRIGHT using identical training recipes; develop Hierarchical Representation Similarity Analysis (HRSA) to decompose similarity into representation, geometry, and function levels; analyze local vs global manifold changes and effects of linear readout and contrastive alignment.

Result: Null effect: RLVR-initialized embeddings show no consistent performance gains over base embeddings. HRSA reveals irreversible local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate drift, while global manifold geometry and linear readout remain intact. Contrastive learning subsequently realigns representations, producing Manifold Realignment.

Conclusion: RLVR reshapes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than restructuring the landscape itself; unlike supervised fine-tuning, it does not yield fundamental improvements in embedding quality under the same training regime. HRSA provides a principled lens to understand how local vs global representation properties contribute to this effect.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

### [111] [When should I search more: Adaptive Complex Query Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21208)
*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO), a reinforcement learning framework for complex Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) query optimization that adaptively expands queries and fuses rank scores; uses Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) and Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) modules with Curriculum Reinforcement Learning to stabilize training; achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, with improved efficiency and broad compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world scenarios, user queries are often complex, requiring multiple parallel and sequential sub-queries. Existing RL approaches focus on single-query expansion, leading to an enormous search space and unstable training due to sub-query count decisions, merging/re-ranking, and reward design.

Method: ACQO comprises two core components: (1) Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into sub-queries, and (2) Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) that robustly aggregates retrieved results and provides stable reward signals. Training uses Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) in a two-stage strategy to gradually introduce harder queries and stabilize learning. The framework is designed to be compatible with various retrieval architectures.

Result: Empirical results show ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines. It also demonstrates improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: ACQO offers a generalizable, adaptive RL-based solution for complex query optimization in RAG systems, delivering improved performance, stability, and efficiency, and paving the way for scalable multi-subquery strategies in next-generation retrieval systems.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

*Paul He,Yinya Huang,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A symbolic verifier (DoVerifier) checks LLM-generated causal expressions for derivability from a causal graph using do-calculus and probability theory, improving semantic evaluation of causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal reasoning benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics (e.g., string similarity) that can miss semantically valid derivations or mislabel incorrect reasoning. A formal semantic verifier is needed to assess true causal reasoning.

Method: Introduce DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that determines whether an LLM-produced causal expression is derivable from a given causal graph using do-calculus rules and probability theory; validates hypotheses against the graph-derived expressions.

Result: DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, enabling recovery of correct answers that would be marked incorrect by surface metrics on synthetic and causal QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: A symbolic verification framework like DoVerifier provides a rigorous and informative method to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning, aligning evaluation with causal semantics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DRL-LLM integrated framework (Intelli-Planner) for participatory urban planning that uses demographic/geographic data and stakeholder preferences to generate high-level planning requirements, with a knowledge enhancement module and LLM-based satisfaction scoring; it outperforms traditional baselines and matches state-of-the-art DRL metrics while boosting stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current planning methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and offer limited stakeholder involvement. There is a need for participatory, data-driven planning that can incorporate diverse preferences at scale.

Method: Intelli-Planner combines deep reinforcement learning with large language models. It uses demographic, geographic data and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. A knowledge-enhancement module improves the policy network's decision-making during training. Evaluation combines a multi-dimensional system and LLM-based stakeholder satisfaction scoring.

Result: Across diverse urban settings, Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art DRL methods on objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with DRL is effective for functional-area planning, highlighting significant potential to advance participatory and optimized urban planning.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

TL;DR: Dual-encoding constraint-based causal discovery for categorical features, merged by majority voting; robust to categorical instability; validated on Titanic with results aligning with explainable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Categorical variables cause numerical instability in conditional independence tests, hindering reliable causal discovery and explainability in ML models.

Method: Apply constraint-based causal discovery using two complementary encodings of categorical features, then merge the resulting graphs via majority voting to produce a final causal structure.

Result: The approach yields causal graphs on the Titanic dataset that are consistent with established explainable methods.

Conclusion: A dual-encoding, ensemble-like strategy improves robustness of causal discovery for categorical data and supports interpretable ML explanations.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.

*Wolfgang Rohde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Runtime governance via a Governance Twin is proposed to preserve human relevance as decision-making moves to runtime in agentic AI; static, compliance-based governance is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional governance that relies on pre-defined rules and post-hoc accountability fails when AI systems can make opaque, rapid decisions at machine speed; humans risk becoming irrelevant participants in socially consequential AI-driven processes.

Method: Conceptual analysis introducing the Governance Twin as a runtime governance framework; argumentation and positioning within existing governance discourse.

Result: The paper argues that runtime governance is a strong candidate for preserving human relevance and that accountability, agency, and punishment must be rethought in this transition; the Governance Twin is presented as a candidate framework.

Conclusion: To sustain human relevance in AI-driven governance, runtime governance through the Governance Twin offers promise, but requires redefining accountability, agency, and punitive mechanisms and warrants further operational development.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

Motivation: Autonomous code agents expand the LLM attack surface by enabling prolonged interaction and self-directed behavior; system prompts guiding model behavior are increasingly at risk of extraction, necessitating defense research.

Method: Online exploration using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection with a hierarchical skill space (atomic probes and high-level orchestration). No handcrafted prompts, no labeled data, and no privileged access beyond standard user interaction. Evaluation on 41 black-box commercial models from multiple providers.

Result: The framework consistently recovers full or near-complete system prompts across diverse models, revealing recurring design and architecture-level vulnerabilities and demonstrating that system prompts are an emergent, weakly protected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Conclusion: System prompts represent a critical yet underprotected attack surface in contemporary agent architectures; defenses should address prompt leakage, access controls, and robust prompt-injection mitigations, informed by the demonstrated vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

### [117] [TIDE: Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution for LLM-Based Automated Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21239)
*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIDE decouples structural evolution from parameter tuning in automated heuristic design for combinatorial optimization by nesting a parallel island evolution with Tree Similarity Edit Distance for structure diversity and an inner LLM-guided parameter tuning loop, guided by a UCB scheduler; it achieves superior solution quality and efficiency across nine problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated heuristic design treats algorithm evolution as a single text-generation task, which conflates discrete structural choices with continuous parameter values, leading to uncalibrated constants and premature convergence due to simplistic similarity metrics.

Method: 1) Outer parallel island model that uses Tree Similarity Edit Distance to promote structural diversity; 2) Inner loop that couples LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for tuning numerical parameters; 3) UCB-based scheduler to prioritize high-yield prompt strategies and optimize resource allocation.

Result: Empirical evaluation across nine combinatorial optimization problems shows TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while also improving search efficiency and reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Decoupling structure from parameter tuning via a nested, UCB-guided, evolution-based framework enables more effective heuristic discovery, yielding higher-quality solutions with better resource efficiency.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

### [118] [Position: Certifiable State Integrity in Cyber-Physical Systems -- Why Modular Sovereignty Solves the Plasticity-Stability Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21249)
*Enzo Nicolás Spotorno,Antônio Augusto Medeiros Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modular, frozen regime-specific specialists blended with uncertainty awareness (HYDRA) to tackle plasticity-stability in CPS and enable verifiable, auditable state integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS exhibit non-stationary dynamics and strict reliability requirements. Fine-tuning base time-series models causes forgetting; spectral bias masks high-frequency faults and opacity hinders verification per safety standards.

Method: Propose HYDRA: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific experts whose outputs are blended by uncertainty-aware mechanisms. Emphasizes hierarchical disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, regime-conditional validity, and modular auditability for certification across the CPS lifecycle.

Result: Position paper outlining a conceptual framework. Expected benefits include reduced catastrophic forgetting, preserved high-frequency fault signaling, improved transparency, and a path toward certification under standards like ISO 26262 and IEC 61508.

Conclusion: HYDRA offers a certifiable, modular approach to robust state integrity in CPS by avoiding global parameter updates, enabling regime-conditioned validity and traceable, auditable disclaimers across lifecycle.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Drive-KD introduces layer-specific attention-guided distillation within a perception–reasoning–planning framework to create efficient autonomous driving VLMs via single-teacher and multi-teacher distillation, aided by asymmetric gradient projection to reduce cross-capability conflicts; achieves strong efficiency and competitive planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory and latency bottlenecks of large models and the limited transfer of capability to small models by enabling efficient, capability-aligned distillation for autonomous driving VLMs.

Method: Decompose autonomous driving into a perception–reasoning–planning triad. Use layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to build capability-specific single-teacher models. Unify these into a multi-teacher distillation framework and apply asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Validate across diverse model families and scales.

Result: Distilled InternVL3-1B uses ~42× less GPU memory and ~11.4× higher throughput, while achieving better overall performance than a pretrained 78B model on DriveBench, and surpassing GPT-5.1 on planning. Demonstrates strong generalization across model families and scales.

Conclusion: Capability-specific distillation with attention signals and asymmetric gradient projection can yield efficient, high-performing autonomous driving VLMs, offering practical guidance for scalable deployment across model sizes.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White-Op provides an interpretable, human-reasoning–driven framework for op-amp parameter design using LLMs, yielding reliable, interpretable designs with low prediction error across 9 topologies and preserving transistor-level functionality; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the opacity of AI-assisted circuit design by formalizing human reasoning into explicit steps; enable verifiable, interpretable parameter synthesis for op-amps.

Method: Iteratively introduce hypothetical constraints to determine pole/zero placements, formulate a closed-form optimization, solve programmatically, and verify via simulation; theory-simulation analysis guides refinement in a human-like hypothesis-verification-decision loop.

Result: Evaluated on 9 op-amp topologies; White-Op outperforms uninterpretable black-box baseline which fails on 5 topologies; achieves 8.52% theoretical prediction error; design functionality preserved after transistor-level mapping for all topologies; open-source at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of interpretable AI-guided analog design using structured human-like reasoning; improves reliability and interpretability alongside quantitative performance; suggests potential applicability to broader analog design tasks with appropriate verification.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

### [121] [Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21335)
*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNRE introduces a causal neuro-symbolic framework for explainable multi-behavior recommendation, modeling endogenous user logic and causal mediators to address confounding, via hierarchical preference propagation and adaptive neural-logic pathways, achieving superior performance and multi-level explainability on three large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a trade-off between recommendation performance and explainability. Current explainable approaches rely on external information and poorly generalize. Exploiting neuro-symbolic integration and endogenous user logic, enhanced by causal inference, can yield explainable and robust multi-behavior recommendations.

Method: CNRE uses hierarchical preference propagation to capture cross-behavior dependencies, models endogenous logic rules from preference strengths, and adaptively dispatches to neural-logic reasoning paths (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). It generates an explainable causal mediator to isolate effects from confounders, enabling explicit reasoning in a human-like decision process.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three large-scale datasets shows CNRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multi-level explainability from model design, decision process, to recommendation results.

Conclusion: Integrating causal inference with neuro-symbolic reasoning to model endogenous behavior logic yields improved performance and richer explanations for multi-behavior recommendations, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

*Jennifer Haase,Jana Gonnermann-Müller,Paul H. P. Hanel,Nicolas Leins,Thomas Kosch,Jan Mendling,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prompts explain a comparable portion of output variance as model choice for originality, while model choice dominates fluency; substantial within-LLM sampling variance (10-34%) means single-sample evaluations can conflate noise with genuine effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify how much of LLM output variance is attributable to prompts, model choice, and stochastic sampling, to guide evaluation practices and prompt design.

Method: Variance decomposition across 12 LLMs, 10 prompts, and 100 samples per prompt (N = 12,000). Analyzed two output metrics: originality (quality) and fluency (quantity).

Result: Originality: prompts explain 36.43% of variance; model choice explains 40.94% (comparable). Fluency: model choice explains 51.25% of variance; within-LLM variance explains 33.70%; prompts explain 4.22%. Within-LLM variance ranges from 10% to 34% across contexts.

Conclusion: Prompts are effective for steering output quality, but substantial within-LLM variance implies that single-sample evaluations are noisy. Robust evaluation should use multiple samples per prompt and per model to disentangle effects.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

### [123] [EHR-RAG: Bridging Long-Horizon Structured Electronic Health Records and Large Language Models via Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21340)
*Lang Cao,Qingyu Chen,Yue Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented framework (EHR-RAG) for long-horizon structured EHR data that preserves temporal structure, refines queries adaptively, and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence, outperforming strong LLM baselines (Macro-F1 +10.76%) across four tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon EHRs exceed typical LLM context windows; truncation or naive retrieval discards clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies, hindering reliable predictions.

Method: Three components: (1) Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics; (2) Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries and expand evidence coverage; (3) Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieve and reason over factual and counterfactual evidence.

Result: Across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks, EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that retrieval-augmented LLMs can effectively leverage structured EHR data for long-horizon clinical prediction, with designs that preserve temporal structure and enable broader, dual-path evidence reasoning.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

*Zhiyong Shen,Gongpeng Zhao,Jun Zhou,Li Yu,Guandong Kou,Jichen Li,Chuanlei Dong,Zuncheng Li,Kaimao Li,Bingkun Wei,Shicheng Hu,Wei Xia,Wenguo Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ostrakon-VL is an FSRS-tuned MLLM built on Qwen3-VL-8B; ShopBench is a new FSRS benchmark; QUAD data-curation pipeline; multi-stage training yields state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs at similar scales (60.1 ShopBench), with improved parameter efficiency and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSRS scenarios suffer from noisy, heterogeneous data and lack standardized, fine-grained benchmarks; there is a need for robust data-curation pipelines and unified evaluation to enable reliable deployment.

Method: Develop Ostrakon-VL using Qwen3-VL-8B as base; introduce ShopBench benchmark for FSRS; propose QUAD as a multi-stage multimodal instruction data-curation pipeline; apply a multi-stage training strategy; publicly release models and benchmark.

Result: Ostrakon-VL attains an average ShopBench score of 60.1, setting a new SOTA among open-source MLLMs with similar parameter counts; outperforms larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by 0.7 and the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by 4.8, indicating improved parameter efficiency and robustness for FSRS tasks.

Conclusion: The work presents a cohesive approach to data quality, standardized evaluation, and efficient multimodal learning for FSRS, offering reproducibility via public release and establishing a practical baseline for FSRS-oriented MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark and workflow enabling LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies; demonstrates that agent-driven, closed-loop, executable-code-based optimization can surpass baselines, shrink gaps between open-source and proprietary models, and self-correct failures in embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome bottlenecks in scaling embodied AI due to manual reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, and back-end heterogeneity by leveraging autonomous, software-like AI agents that can draft, debug, and refine policies using feedback from simulation environments.

Method: Introduce EmboCoach-Bench, a 32-task RL/IL benchmark with an executable-code interface. The workflow is closed-loop: agents draft solutions, deploy in simulation, receive environment feedback, debug, and optimize (e.g., physics-informed rewards, diffusion-policy architectures). Evaluate cross-model agentic workflows and compare to human-engineered baselines.

Result: Autonomous agents qualitatively exceed human-engineered baselines by 26.5% average success. Agentic workflows improve policy development and reduce performance gaps between open-source and proprietary models. Agents demonstrate self-correction, reviving task performance from near-failure through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of self-evolving embodied intelligence driven by autonomous, feedback-informed code generation and debugging, enabling scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DFS-based GUI task execution framework (BEAP-Agent) enables long-range backtracking across multi-level states, using Planner, Executor, and Tracker to recover from erroneous exploration; evaluated on OSWorld with 28.2% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents often fail when an exploration path goes wrong, lacking systematic backtracking for long-horizon tasks; this impedes reliability and robustness in automation.

Method: BEAP-Agent introduces a DFS-based architecture with three collaborative components—Planner, Executor, and Tracker—that support long-range, multi-level state backtracking and dynamic task tracking/updating during task exploration and execution.

Result: On the OSWorld benchmark, BEAP-Agent achieved 28.2% accuracy, demonstrating the proposed backtracking-based approach can effectively enable task exploration and recovery.

Conclusion:  BEAP-Agent fills a gap in systematic backtracking for GUI agents, offering a structured solution for long-horizon task exploration, albeit with room for performance improvements as indicated by the reported accuracy.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PLaT decouples latent planning from text grounding, modeling a deterministic latent planning trajectory and a separate decoder. It dynamically terminates reasoning, enabling inference-time search and greater reasoning diversity, at the cost of greedy accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and collapse of reasoning paths in discrete-token CoT and opaque end-to-end latent reasoning methods; enable scalable, dynamic, and transparent latent reasoning.

Method: Model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states and use a separate decoder to ground thoughts into text when needed. Decouple planning from verbalization to allow dynamic termination and optimize inference-time search.

Result: On mathematical benchmarks, PLaT trades off lower greedy accuracy for substantially higher reasoning diversity and scalability, indicating a broader, more robust solution space and a transparent foundation for inference-time search.

Conclusion: PLaT presents a novel latent-reasoning paradigm that separates planning from grounding, enabling dynamic termination and scalable inference-time search, with a trade-off between accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL), a model-agnostic framework that combines local Hebbian updates (via Oja's rule with competitive learning) with a global sign-based signal to steer updates, achieving competitive performance to backprop on large-scale tasks while preserving biological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome backpropagation's lack of biological plausibility and high computational cost by augmenting local Hebbian learning with a global objective signal, enabling scalable, task-aligned updates across networks.

Method: A model-agnostic framework combining: (1) a local component using Oja's rule with competitive learning for stable local updates; (2) a global component with a sign-based neuromodulatory signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian updates to align with global objectives; evaluated across diverse networks and datasets including ImageNet.

Result: Extensive experiments show GHL outperforms existing Hebbian methods and, on large-scale networks and complex datasets like ImageNet, achieves competitive results, significantly narrowing the gap with standard backpropagation.

Conclusion: GHL provides a scalable, biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation by fusing local plasticity with a global, sign-based guidance signal, achieving competitive performance on large tasks and broad network architectures.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

Method: Uses autonomous coding agents (ACAs) as first-class abstractions for API-like interaction; introduces coordination patterns, asymmetric validation loops between optimizer and simulator implementations, external memory, MBR decoding, self-consistency; sandboxed environments ensure executable code; iterative refinement of task specifications; evaluation on nine optimization benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of execution-aware agent architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Conclusion: Execution-aware, ACA-based architectures with engineered validation and repair enable robust, executable optimization models; NEMO demonstrates the viability and benefits of this approach and facilitates higher-level system construction around ACAs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

### [130] [TeachBench: A Syllabus-Grounded Framework for Evaluating Teaching Ability in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21375)
*Zheng Li,Siyao Song,Jingyuan Ma,Rui Li,Ying Zeng,Minghao Li,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A syllabus-grounded evaluation framework assesses LLM teaching by measuring student performance gains after structured, multi-turn instruction; instantiated on Gaokao data across subjects, revealing model- and domain-dependent teaching effectiveness with limited benefit from example problems; establishes teaching ability as a measurable LLM behavior dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where LLM teaching capability is underexplored and existing benchmarks emphasize problem-solving rather than knowledge-centered teaching; also to reduce information leakage and enable reuse of existing benchmarks by constraining teachers to structured content.

Method: Develop a syllabus-grounded framework that constrains teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, evaluates student performance after multi-turn instruction, and reuses existing benchmarks; instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects to compare teaching effectiveness across models and domains.

Result: Significant variation in teaching effectiveness across models and subjects (e.g., some models excel in mathematics; physics/chemistry pose greater challenges); incorporating example problems does not always improve teaching and may lead to overfitting to example-specific error corrections; overall, teaching ability emerges as a distinct, measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

Conclusion: Teaching ability is a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior; the proposed syllabus-grounded evaluation enables robust assessment and reuse of benchmarks, with implications for model development and evaluation across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

### [131] [DataCross: A Unified Benchmark and Agent Framework for Cross-Modal Heterogeneous Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21403)
*Ruyi Qi,Zhou Liu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataCross introduces a cross-modal benchmark and a cooperative agent framework to bridge structured and unstructured data analysis. It provides 200 end-to-end tasks across domains, a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, a modular DataCrossAgent with specialized sub-agents and structured workflow, and a ReAct-inspired reReAct mechanism for code generation and verification. Empirical results show a 29.7% factuality improvement over GPT-4o and robustness on hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between structured data analytics and unstructured, visually presented information (zombie data) that is locked in documents, which current agents fail to leverage.

Method: Define DataCrossBench with 200 tasks across finance, healthcare, etc., built via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline with three difficulty tiers for visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step reasoning. Propose DataCrossAgent, a divide-and-conquer, multi-sub-agent system with Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, Contextual Cross-pollination, and a reReAct mechanism for robust code generation and factual verification.

Result: DataCrossAgent achieves 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and demonstrates robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented zombie data for cross-modal analysis.

Conclusion: The framework enables unified analysis across heterogeneous data modalities and provides an evaluation benchmark, with improved factuality and robustness, enabling practical insight extraction from fragmented data sources.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

### [132] [System 1&2 Synergy via Dynamic Model Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21414)
*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Chong Tian,Xiyu Liu,Dingyu Yao,Chuanyu Qin,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAMI enables dynamic, query-specific control of reasoning depth via linear interpolation between Instruct and Thinking checkpoints, improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining efficiency, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System 1 vs System 2 cognitive modes interfere in unified LMs; existing work focuses on output control (length, latency) rather than how the model thinks; aim to modulate cognitive configuration (capability control) to improve efficiency and depth.

Method: Use dynamic parameter interpolation (linear interpolation) across pretrained Instruct and Thinking checkpoints without training; DAMI estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity λ(q) to set cognitive depth; training-based estimation via preference learning; zero-shot deployment uses confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

Result: On five math reasoning benchmarks, DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model with comparable efficiency; shows a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity.

Conclusion: DAMI provides a practical, training-free framework to combine System 1 efficiency with System 2 reasoning depth, via capability control rather than output control.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

### [133] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Negation handling in LLMs is fragile; negated prohibitions are often treated as affirmations across models, with significant variation and governance concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To audit model behavior under negation across ethical scenarios, quantify NSI, and propose governance tools to mitigate dangerous misinterpretation in high-stakes contexts.

Method: Evaluation of 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios under simple and compound negation, with deterministic decoding; measure agreement, identify failures; case studies; propose NSI and tiered certification.

Result: Open-source models comply with prohibitions poorly (77% under simple negation, 100% under compound). Commercial models better but still show substantial swings (19-128%). Model agreement drops from 74% to 62% under negation. Financial scenarios more fragile than medical. Results robust to decoding randomness. Case studies and governance proposals provided (NSI, certification).

Conclusion: Many models cannot reliably distinguish 'do X' from 'do not X'; without improvement, they should not autonomously decide in high-stakes contexts; need governance metrics and tiered certification to ensure safe deployment.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction-tuned LLMs show near-total resistance to emotional framing in high-stakes decisions, far exceeding human biases; a 162-scenario benchmark is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify robustness of LLMs to narrative framing in consequential tasks and compare with human susceptibility, addressing the gap between lexical prompt-sensitivity and normative decision biases.

Method: A controlled perturbation framework across healthcare, law, and finance; compare models and humans using effect size metrics (Cohen's h); test diverse instruction-tuned models; analyze framing vs formatting effects.

Result: Models exhibit near-zero framing effect (Cohen's h ≈ 0.003) while humans show substantial framing biases (Cohen's h ≈ 0.3–0.8); robustness persists across training paradigms; 110–300× greater resistance than humans.

Conclusion: Suggests logical-rule adherence can be decoupled from persuasive narratives; provides decision stability and potential to de-bias human judgment; dataset and code released for broader evaluation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address saturation and narrow task diversity in existing LLM benchmarks, and better reflect LLM performance in real industrial hardware-design workflows.

Method: Three tasks (Verilog generation, debugging, reference model generation) evaluated on 44 modules with complex hierarchies, 89 debugging cases, and 132 reference-model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation uses pass rates; baseline is Claude-4.5-opus. Automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation provided; code released at GitHub.

Dataset reveals challenges in AI-assisted chip design tasks; benchmarking framework and data-generation toolbox are provided.

Conclusion: Benchmark unveils substantial challenges for current LLMs in practical hardware-design tasks and offers tools to enhance future research, including automated data generation for training reference models; code availability facilitates reproducibility.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain.

### [136] [LION: A Clifford Neural Paradigm for Multimodal-Attributed Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21453)
*Xunkai Li,Zhengyu Wu,Zekai Chen,Henan Sun,Daohan Su,Guang Zeng,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces LION, a Clifford algebra-based decoupled GNN for multimodal-attributed graphs, implementing alignment-then-fusion through a modality-aware geometric manifold and adaptive holographic aggregation, achieving SOTA on 9 datasets across 3 graph and 3 modality tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural paradigms for multimodal graphs neglect graph context during modality alignment and lack adaptive fusion for multi-modality with topology priors, hindering performance and generalization.

Method: Proposes LION with (1) a modality-aware geometric manifold built on Clifford algebra enabling high-order propagation for modality interaction and alignment; (2) adaptive holographic aggregation leveraging geometric grade properties (energy and scale) with learnable parameters to fuse modalities; adopts a propagation-then-aggregation (decoupled) paradigm.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph tasks and 3 modality tasks.

Conclusion: LION provides a principled, geometry-informed approach to multimodal-attributed graphs, improving alignment and fusion, with strong empirical gains and potential generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [137] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topeax introduces a density-peak-based method to determine the number of clusters and combines lexical and semantic term weighting to improve topic clustering, outperforming Top2Vec and BERTopic with more robust behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text clustering approaches (Top2Vec, BERTopic) suffer from unreliable cluster discovery due to sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, and they use suboptimal term weighting (semantic distance vs word counts), leading to less coherent topics.

Method: Topeax detects cluster count from peaks in density estimates and integrates lexical and semantic indices for term importance to produce high-quality keywords.

Result: Empirically, Topeax achieves better cluster recovery and description than Top2Vec and BERTopic and shows reduced sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax offers a more robust and coherent topic clustering framework, addressing key weaknesses of existing methods.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

### [138] [MemOCR: Layout-Aware Visual Memory for Efficient Long-Horizon Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21468)
*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR uses adaptive visual memory layout to compress long interaction histories for long-horizon reasoning. It maintains a structured rich-text memory (headings, highlights), renders it as an image for the agent to consult, and is trained with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives to operate under tight context budgets. It outperforms text-based baselines on long-context multi-hop and single-hop QA under extreme budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning requires condensing growing histories into a limited context window. Text-only memories allocate equal token cost to all content, wasting budget on low-value details; thus there is a need for memory representations with variable information density that prioritize crucial evidence.

Method: Propose MemOCR, a multimodal memory system that stores structured rich-text memory and renders it as an image to guide memory access. The agent learns to allocate memory with adaptive information density via visual layout and is trained with reinforcement learning using budget-aware objectives that expose it to diverse compression levels.

Result: Empirical results show MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines on long-context multi-hop and single-hop QA benchmarks, achieving more efficient context utilization under extreme budgets.

Conclusion: Adaptive, multimodal memory with a visual layout and budget-aware RL can enhance long-horizon reasoning by prioritizing crucial evidence and aggressively compressing auxiliary details under tight context budgets.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScaleSim is a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations, enabling proactive prefetching and eviction with an abstraction called invocation distance, achieving up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based multi-agent simulations face severe GPU memory pressure as agent counts grow because each agent maintains private GPU-resident states (models, prefix caches, adapters). This hampers scalability; a memory-management solution that exploits workload properties is needed.

Method: Propose invocation distance as a unified abstraction to estimate the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests, and design ScaleSim around this abstraction to support proactive prefetching, priority-based eviction, and diverse agent-specific memory via a modular interface.

Result: Demonstrates memory efficiency and speedup, achieving up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks through prefetching and eviction strategies guided by invocation distance.

Conclusion: Invocation distance enables effective memory management for large-scale LLM simulations; ScaleSim provides a practical, scalable solution with performance gains.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

### [140] [The Effectiveness of Style Vectors for Steering Large Language Models: A Human Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21505)
*Diaoulé Diallo,Katharina Dworatzyk,Sophie Jentzsch,Peer Schütt,Sabine Theis,Tobias Hecking*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Activation steering can influence emotional tone in LLM outputs; first human evaluation shows reliable steering at moderate strength with good agreement to automatic scores; larger model (LlaMA-3) improves consistency; high inter-rater reliability; supports activation-based control as scalable for affective steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for lightweight, scalable alignment controls for LLMs that go beyond prompts and fine-tuning by directly modulating activations to shape affective outputs, and to validate this with human judgments.

Method: Human evaluation via crowd-sourced Ratings: over 7,000 ratings from 190 participants via Prolific, assessing perceived emotional intensity and overall quality. Analysis includes correlations between human and model-based quality (r), steering at moderate strength (λ≈0.15), comparisons across emotions (disgust, fear most affected; surprise least affected), model comparison Alpaca vs LlaMA-3, inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.71–0.87), and statistical significance (p<0.001).

Result: Moderate activation steering reliably amplifies target emotions while preserving comprehensibility; strongest effects for disgust and fear, minimal for surprise. Human-model quality correlation high (mean r=0.776). Model upgrade (Alpaca→LlaMA-3) yields more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions (p<0.001). Inter-rater reliability high (ICC 0.71–0.87).

Conclusion: Activation-based control is a scalable method to steer LLM behavior across affective dimensions, validated by robust human judgments and strong alignment with automatic quality scores, with larger models offering more reliable steering.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Lars Kotthoff,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces LLaMEA-SAGE, a feature-guided extension to LLaMEA that uses AST-derived code features and explainable AI to steer LLM-based automated algorithm design, achieving faster convergence and better performance on GECCO MA-BBOB benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fitness-only feedback in AAD via LLaMEA leaves valuable information in generated code untapped; leveraging code structure, complexity features, and surrogate modeling can guide generation more efficiently.

Method: Extract graph-theoretic/complexity features from generated algorithm ASTs; train a surrogate model over evaluated solutions; use explainable AI to identify influential features; translate these into natural-language mutation instructions to bias LLM generation; integrate into LLaMEA as LLaMEA-SAGE; evaluate on small and MA-BBOB benchmarks.

Result: Matches vanilla LLaMEA performance faster in a small test; outperforms state-of-the-art AAD on the MA-BBOB GECCO-MA-BBOB suite; demonstrates viability of code-derived signals to guide AAD.

Conclusion: Code-structure-informed guidance can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm design, reducing search effort and improving performance; bridges machine-generated code characteristics with human-understandable feedback.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

*Alireza Nadaf,Alireza Mohammadshahi,Majid Yazdani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAPSO is a modular, long-horizon framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization that treats synthesis as an operator within an optimization loop guided by evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses long-horizon failures in coding agents (state loss, brittle debugging, weak reuse) by integrating a git-native experimentation engine, a structured knowledge system, and a cognitive memory layer.

Method: Three tightly coupled components: 1) a git-native experimentation engine that isolates attempts as branches for reproducibility; 2) a knowledge system that ingests heterogeneous sources (repositories, playbooks, docs, papers, web results) and organizes them for retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints; 3) a cognitive memory layer maintaining an episodic store of reusable lessons from run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback to reduce errors and accelerate convergence.

Result: Evaluated on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization); reports end-to-end performance.

Conclusion: KAPSO demonstrates that long-horizon optimization for autonomous programming is feasible through integrated experimentation, knowledge, and memory components; code available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

### [143] [ARGORA: Orchestrated Argumentation for Causally Grounded LLM Reasoning and Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21533)
*Youngjin Jin,Hanna Kim,Kwanwoo Kim,Chanhee Lee,Seungwon Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARGORA introduces explicit argumentation graphs for multi-expert LLMs, reframing reasoning as causal graphs to identify necessary arguments, allow targeted edits, and align with external judgments; demonstrates competitive accuracy and corrective behavior across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite ensembles of expert opinions, existing systems obscure what arguments drive decisions; need transparent, verifiable reasoning and robustness to targeted perturbations.

Method: Construct explicit argumentation graphs from multi-expert discussions; cast as causal models; perform counterfactual edits by removing arguments; introduce a correction mechanism to align internal reasoning with external judgments; evaluate across benchmarks and an open-ended use case.

Result: Competitive accuracy; ARGORA resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than introducing new errors when experts disagree; provides causal diagnostics of decisive arguments; demonstrates corrective behavior.

Conclusion: ARGORA offers transparent, controllable reasoning for multi-expert LLMs, enabling identification of necessary vs. sufficient arguments and robust decision-making; potential for improved reliability and explainability in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

### [144] [ShardMemo: Masked MoE Routing for Sharded Agentic LLM Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21545)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Yue Xiu,Mengying Kou,Yuliang Zheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShardMemo is a budgeted, tiered memory service for agentic LLMs that partitions memory into per-agent state, sharded evidence with local ANN indexes, and a versioned skill library, enabling scalable, cost-aware routing with notable accuracy and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized memory indexes and rigid partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel multi-agent execution scale; a tiered, shard-aware design with scope-before-routing aims to improve throughput, accuracy, and budget adherence.

Method: Propose Tier A/B/C memory architecture; Tier B uses shard-local ANN indexes with scope-before-routing through eligibility constraints; treat shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts routing over eligible shards; probe up to B_probe shards via Top-B_probe or adaptive Top-P; apply cost-aware gating across shard families; router trained from evidence-to-shard supervision.

Result: Empirical gains across tasks: LoCoMo shows +5.11 to +6.82 F1 over GAM; under fixed budget (B_probe=3), +6.87 F1 over cosine-to-prototype routing; retrieval work reduced (VecScan 521→414, -20.5%); p95 latency 95→76 ms. HotpotQA long-context: F1 of 63.41/61.88/57.95 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. ToolBench: Tier C yields Precision@3 0.97 and StepRed 1.94 (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity).

Conclusion: ShardMemo demonstrates that budgeted, tiered, shard-aware memory enables scalable long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent coordination with improved accuracy and reduced retrieval costs, suggesting practical viability for agentic LLM systems.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

### [145] [Meta Context Engineering via Agentic Skill Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21557)
*Haoran Ye,Xuning He,Vincent Arak,Haonan Dong,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta Context Engineering (MCE) introduces a bi-level, co-evolutionary framework that replaces static context-harvest CE with a meta-level agent that evolves CE skills through targeted crossovers and a base-level agent that builds and tests flexible context artifacts, yielding consistent gains over state-of-the-art CE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases and rigidity in manually crafted CE workflows by enabling adaptive, transferable, and scalable context optimization through co-evolution of skills and artifacts.

Method: A bi-level system where a meta-level agent performs agentic crossover and deliberative search over CE history to refine skills, while a base-level agent executes skills and optimizes context as flexible files/code, evaluated offline and online across five domains.

Result: MCE achieves 5.6–53.8% relative improvements over leading CE methods (mean ~16.9%), with better context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in context usage and training.

Conclusion: Bi-level co-evolution of CE skills and artifacts yields robust, transferable context optimization, surpassing static CE heuristics in diverse domains and settings.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

### [146] [Chain Of Thought Compression: A Theoritical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21576)
*Juncai Li,Ru Li,Yuxiang Zhou,Boxiang Ma,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical framework (Order-r Interaction) to explain why learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps (implicit CoT) is hard due to exponential decay of high-order dependencies, introduces NatBool-DAG to test irreducible reasoning, and proposes ALiCoT to align latent token distributions with reasoning states, achieving substantial speedups (54.4x) with performance comparable to explicit CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the computational inefficiency of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by elucidating why compressing intermediate reasoning is difficult, and to develop a practical, token-efficient alternative.

Method: (1) Theoretical analysis introducing Order-r Interaction to characterize high-order dependency learning signals; (2) proof of exponential decay barriers indicating irreducible problems when skipping steps; (3) construction of NatBool-DAG benchmark to enforce irreducible reasoning and remove semantic shortcuts; (4) development of ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT) that aligns latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states to overcome signal decay; (5) empirical evaluation comparing ALiCoT against explicit CoT.

Result: The authors establish a theoretical decay barrier for high-order logic in learning intermediate steps, validate the barrier using the NatBool-DAG benchmark, and demonstrate that ALiCoT can achieve a 54.4x speedup with performance comparable to explicit CoT by aligning latent representations with reasoning states.

Conclusion: High-order logical dependencies pose irreducible learning barriers for implicit CoT; aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states (ALiCoT) can overcome signal decay, enabling efficient, token-lean reasoning without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

### [147] [Depth-Recurrent Attention Mixtures: Giving Latent Reasoning the Attention it Deserves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21582)
*Jonas Knupp,Jan Hendrik Metzen,Jeremias Bohn,Georg Groh,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dreamer: a modular depth-recurrent attention framework that combines sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse-expert attention to overcome hidden-size bottlenecks and enable scalable, efficient depth recurrence. It achieves substantial token-efficiency; matches or exceeds SOTA FLOPs/parameters/memory while using smaller tokens and shows high expert-diversity across depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth-recurrent models suffer from unfair baselines, underutilized depth, and a constant hidden-size bottleneck that limits multi-step latent reasoning. There is a need for a parameter- and compute-efficient, depth-aware attention framework with flexible depth recurrence.

Method: Introduce Dreamer, a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It decouples scaling dimensions, enables attention along depth to mitigate hidden-size bottlenecks, and provides depth-recurrent modeling with efficient hardware characteristics. The framework supports FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines.

Result: On language reasoning benchmarks, Dreamer requires 2–8x fewer training tokens to reach the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA. It also matches or surpasses ~2x larger SOTA models when given the same training tokens. Additionally, it reveals higher expert selection diversity across depths (2–11x) than SOTA MoEs.

Conclusion: Dreamer offers a scalable, efficient path for depth-recurrent reasoning by decoupling depth from hidden size and leveraging mixed attention, achieving strong token efficiency and richer depth-wise knowledge usage.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

### [148] [Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATP-Latent uses a conditional VAE to supervise latent tokens and reinforcement learning with a coherence reward, enabling active latent planning for dense CoT reasoning and achieving higher accuracy with fewer tokens on LLaMA-1B across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent CoT methods rely on imitating a single language label. Multiple valid CoT expressions exist, so passive imitation can yield suboptimal and inconsistent latent representations, causing a training-testing gap. An active planning approach over the latent space is needed to learn better latent reasoning policies.

Method: Model latent-token supervision as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to yield a smoother latent space. Use reinforcement learning guided by an auxiliary coherence reward based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens to steer the latent policy.

Result: On four benchmarks using LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent achieves +4.1 percentage points in accuracy and -3.3% in token usage compared with advanced baselines.

Conclusion: Active latent planning via a conditional VAE and coherence-guided RL yields more robust latent reasoning policies and improved efficiency, as demonstrated on four benchmarks; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

*Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan,Harikrishnan P M,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SBST for IDP validation: maximize distinct failure types under budget; diverse SBST solvers; find solver complementarity; portfolio-based SBST recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IDP systems must validate under limited budgets; need to uncover diverse failure interactions across document configurations rather than a single worst-case.

Method: Formalize as combinatorial search over document configurations with risk features; benchmark evolutionary, swarm, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum search strategies under equal budgets; analyze exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap.

Result: Solvers uncover distinct failure modes; cross-temporal analysis shows persistent solver-specific discoveries; no single strategy dominates; union of solvers recovers failure space; solver complementarity observed.

Conclusion: Portfolio-based SBST is advantageous for robust IDP validation; use multiple solvers to accelerate discovery within budget.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

### [150] [RecNet: Self-Evolving Preference Propagation for Agentic Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21609)
*Bingqian Li,Xiaolei Wang,Junyi Li,Weitao Li,Long Zhang,Sheng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecNet is a self-evolving, agent-based recommender system that uses LLMs to propagate real-time user/item preference updates across a network of router agents, with forward propagation and backward optimization inspired by multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sparsity and noisiness of explicit interactions and to capture real-time mutual influences among users and items, enabling proactive rather than reactive preference updates.

Method: Two-phase architecture: forward phase with centralized preference routing via router agents and a personalized preference reception via a message buffer and a rule-based filter memory; backward phase with feedback-driven propagation optimization using a multi-agent RL-like framework and LLM-based credit assignment for module-level optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across scenarios show RecNet effectively models and propagates preferences, improving personalization metrics and demonstrating self-evolution of propagation strategies.

Conclusion: RecNet enables continuous, real-time, personalized propagation of preferences through self-evolving agent networks, advancing recommender systems toward proactive adaptation.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

### [151] [Semantic Content Determines Algorithmic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618)
*Martiño Ríos-García,Nawaf Alampara,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WhatCounts reveals semantic sensitivity in LLM counting: counting algorithms are not truly content-agnostic, and LLM outputs vary with the semantic type of the input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To isolate and quantify semantic sensitivity in LLMs by testing counting in an atomic, content-free setup, separating semantic effects from reasoning complexity or prompt variation.

Method: An atomic counting task using an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps. Compare performance across semantic types (e.g., cities vs chemicals; names vs symbols). Use controlled ablations to rule out confounds; assess the impact of small, unrelated fine-tuning; include an agentic example to illustrate broader implications.

Result:  Frontier LLMs exhibit over 40% accuracy variation solely based on what is being counted. Ablations rule out confounds; the semantic gap persists and shifts with minor fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement exact algorithms but approximate them, with the approximation being argument-dependent.

Conclusion: Semantic meaning of inputs embeds hidden dependencies in LLM functions beyond counting; this likely extends to other LLM operations, implying that input semantics can influence a wide range of model outputs and tasks.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR:  ScholarGym provides a deterministic, tool-augmented LLM evaluation environment for deep research workflows in academia, separating planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment to enable reproducible, fine-grained analysis on a static corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  To address non-determinism from live APIs that hinders reproducibility and cross-system comparisons in evaluating tool-augmented LLM workflows.

Method:  Build a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval; decouple workflow into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment; supply 2,536 expert-ground-truth queries; enable controlled, repeatable experiments across diverse backbone models.

Result:  Demonstrates how reasoning, planning, and selection strategies interact over iterative refinement; provides insights into component interactions and the impact of deterministic evaluation on reproducibility.

Conclusion:  ScholarGym enables reproducible, component-wise evaluation of deep research workflows for academic literature, offering a controlled benchmark with grounded truth and a large static corpus for systematic analysis.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

*Ahmed Y. Radwan,Christos Emmanouilidis,Hina Tabassum,Deval Pandya,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SONIC-O1 is a fully human-verified benchmark for multimodal LLMs assessing temporally grounded, real-world tasks across 13 domains (4,958 annotations) with demographic metadata; it reveals notable performance gaps in temporal localization, modest MCQ gains between model families, and demographic disparities, enabling reproducible, socially robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a high-quality, temporally grounded benchmark to evaluate multimodal LLMs in real-world sequential audio–video settings beyond static image understanding, and to examine fairness across demographic groups.

Method: Constructed a 4,958-annotation dataset spanning 13 domains with human verification; tasks include open-ended summarization, multiple-choice questions, and temporal localization with rationales; evaluated both closed- and open-source MLLMs and analyzed performance across demographics; released project, dataset, and leaderboard for reproducibility.

Result: Large temporal localization gap (≈22.6%) between best closed-source and open-source models; MCQ accuracy gap is smaller; performance declines across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities; SONIC-O1 is released as an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded, socially robust multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: SONIC-O1 provides a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark for temporally grounded multimodal understanding and social robustness in MLLMs, highlighting strengths and limitations of current models and guiding future research toward real-world, fairer temporally-aware multimodal AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

### [154] [TCAP: Tri-Component Attention Profiling for Unsupervised Backdoor Detection in MLLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21692)
*Mingzu Liu,Hao Fang,Runmin Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP) detects backdoor samples in Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service for Multimodal LLMs by analyzing attention across system instructions, vision inputs, and user text; employing Gaussian Mixture Model profiling and EM-based vote aggregation to filter poisoned data, with robust performance across architectures and attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor risks in Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service for Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and limitations of existing defenses, which are often supervised or fail to generalize across trigger types and modalities; a general, unsupervised, cross-modal defense is needed.

Method: TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into three components (system instructions, vision inputs, user textual queries). It then identifies trigger-responsive attention heads using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling and isolates poisoned samples via Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based vote aggregation. The approach is unsupervised and attack-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods show consistently strong performance, establishing TCAP as a robust and practical backdoor defense for MLLMs.

Conclusion: TCAP provides a general, unsupervised defense against backdoors in FTaaS for MLLMs by profiling tri-component attention, enabling reliable detection of poisoned samples across modalities and trigger types.

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

### [155] [FBS: Modeling Native Parallel Reading inside a Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21708)
*Tongxi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Transformer variant, Fovea-Block-Skip (FBS), adds a trainable feedback loop with Parafovea-Attention Window, Chunk-Head, and Skip-Gate to enable content-adaptive foresight and chunked compute, improving quality-efficiency without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference is strictly token-by-token autoregressive and fails to incorporate content-adaptive foresight, chunk-aware compute allocation, and train-test consistency for preview/skimming. The goal is to improve the quality–efficiency trade-off without increasing model size by injecting human-reading-like strategies into the Transformer.

Method: Introduce Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer (FBS) with three modules: Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW) enabling a trainable loop in attention, Chunk-Head (CH) for chunk-level processing, and Skip-Gate (SG) to adaptively skip tokens. These components create a causal, trainable loop that allows content-aware foresight during inference while preserving parameter count.

Result: On diverse benchmarks, FBS achieves a better quality–efficiency trade-off without adding parameters, and ablation shows PAW, CH, and SG are complementary and jointly contribute to gains.

Conclusion: The three modules form a synergistic combination that delivers more efficient yet higher-quality inference for Transformers by integrating content-aware foresight, chunked processing, and adaptive skipping without increasing model size.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

*Kaixiang Wang,Yidan Lin,Jiong Lou,Zhaojiacheng Zhou,Bunyod Suvonov,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-mem introduces Episodic Context Reconstruction for LLM agents, preserving uncompressed memory contexts within a hierarchical multi-agent system to improve reasoning and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent destructive de-contextualization from memory preprocessing that compresses long-horizon dependencies, enabling robust System-2-like reasoning by maintaining intact contextual traces.

Method: A heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents retain uncompressed memory segments, a central master orchestrates global planning, and segments are activated to allow local reasoning to extract context-aware evidence before aggregation rather than passive retrieval.

Result: On the LoCoMo benchmark, E-mem attains over 54% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75 percentage points, while reducing token cost by over 70%.

Conclusion: E-mem demonstrates that episodic context reconstruction can improve reasoning accuracy and efficiency for long-horizon tasks, offering a promising alternative to memory preprocessing.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DropoutTS is a model-agnostic dropout-based robustness plugin for deep time series, using sample-adaptive dropout computed from reconstruction residuals via spectral sparsity to suppress noise while preserving detail, with negligible overhead and no architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy real-world data; existing robustness methods prune data or require costly prior quantification, often sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness.

Method: Sample-Adaptive Dropout (DropoutTS) leverages spectral sparsity to quantify instance-level noise from reconstruction residuals and maps this noise to adaptive dropout rates. It selectively suppresses spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity and is designed as a plug-in with no architectural modifications.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show improved robustness and backbone performance, with negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: DropoutTS provides effective robustness for deep time series models as a model-agnostic plugin, with minimal overhead and no architectural changes; the authors release code at the provided repository.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: History-aware reference via Epistemic Context Learning (ECL) lets small LLMs infer peer reliability from interaction history, enabling them to outperform much larger baselines and boosting frontier models toward near-perfect performance; trust modeling correlates with final answer quality and the approach generalizes across MA configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness issues in multi-agent systems where agents follow misleading peers due to sycophancy and poor assessment of peer reliability.

Method: Formalize the history-aware reference learning problem by incorporating historical peer interactions as input; develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL) that conditions predictions on explicit peer profiles built from history; further optimize with reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards.

Result: ECL enables small models (e.g., Qwen 3-4B) to outperform a history-agnostic baseline that is eight times larger (Qwen 3-30B) by identifying reliable peers; frontier models achieve near-perfect (100%) performance; ECL generalizes across MA configurations; trust modeling by LLMs correlates with final answer quality.

Conclusion: Estimating peer reliability from interaction history is more effective than assessing peer reasoning quality; ECL provides robust improvements in multi-agent settings and reveals a strong link between trust modeling accuracy and answer quality.

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

TL;DR: SCOUT decouples exploration from exploitation by using lightweight scouts to cheaply explore nonlinguistic environments, bootstrapping the LLM via supervised fine-tuning and RL. It yields strong performance (0.86 avg on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) with substantial efficiency gains (~60% GPU hours) compared to proprietary baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle on unseen, high-dimensional nonlinguistic tasks due to the expensive exploration required to collect environment dynamics. The bottleneck is exploration cost rather than distribution mismatch, motivating a decoupled, scalable exploration strategy.

Method: Introduce scouts (e.g., small MLPs) to rapidly probe environment dynamics and generate trajectories. Use these trajectories to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the LLM, followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning to activate latent world knowledge.

Result: SCOUT enables Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct to achieve an average score of 0.86, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60) while reducing GPU hours by ~60%.

Conclusion: Decoupling exploration via lightweight probes from exploitation in LLMs improves sample efficiency and performance on unseen, nonlinguistic tasks, demonstrating that scalable exploration can bootstrap powerful LLMs for such domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

*Ruian Tie,Wenbo Xiong,Zhengyu Shi,Xinyu Su,Chenyu jiang,Libo Wu,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD) is proposed to generalize downscaling across GCMs without paired data by using a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis and Unified Coordinate Guidance, achieving better 99th percentile metrics and reconstructing events like tropical cyclones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to GCMs due to unpaired training data and domain gaps relative to reanalysis; current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradients with large scaling factors.

Method: Introduce ZSSD, a zero-shot statistical downscaling framework that uses a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Employ Unified Coordinate Guidance to mitigate vanishing gradients and ensure consistency with large-scale fields across varying GCMs.

Result: ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and can reconstruct complex weather events (e.g., tropical cyclones) across heterogeneous GCMs.

Conclusion: ZSSD provides a robust zero-shot downscaling approach that leverages physical priors and coordinate guidance to generalize across GCMs and improve extreme-event fidelity.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend conceptual spaces to temporally realized, goal-directed concepts and enable interpretable recognition in sequential decision domains; support learning/knowledge evolution.

Method: Define strategy concepts as geometric regions in interpretable quality dimensions; encode chess games as trajectories in this space; analyze directional movement toward strategy regions; incorporate dual-perspective interpretations to capture differing viewpoints.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated: movement patterns align with expert commentary; confirms trajectory-based concept recognition and applicability to sequential decision tasks; supports extension to knowledge evolution/learning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Extends conceptual spaces to temporally realized, goal-directed concepts; establishes a foundation for broadly applicable sequential decision-making and for learning/refinement of abstract concepts over time.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioAgent Bench: a benchmark dataset and evaluation suite for AI agents in bioinformatics pipelines, examining end-to-end tasks and robustness; compares frontier closed-source and open-weight models; finds reliable final artifacts but vulnerabilities to perturbations; privacy implications; dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardize and automate evaluation of AI agents on bioinformatics workflows, enabling stress testing, automatic scoring, and privacy-aware benchmarking across models.

Method: Curate end-to-end bioinformatics tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts specifying concrete output artifacts; evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses; employ an LLM-based grader for pipeline progress and outcome validity; conduct robustness tests with controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, prompt bloat).

Result: Frontier agents can complete multi-step pipelines without elaborate scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably; robustness tests reveal failure modes under perturbations, indicating high-level pipeline correctness does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning; closed-source models may be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints, making open-weight models preferable despite lower completion rates.

Conclusion: Public release of the dataset and evaluation suite enables broader benchmarking; highlights the need to improve step-level reasoning and perturbation resilience; privacy considerations influence model choice in sensitive bioinformatics contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

TL;DR: LLM-centered, video-based endotracheal suctioning recognition framework with explainable feedback and anomaly-aware student support; shows 15–20% gains over baselines in accuracy and F1; aims to enhance nursing education and patient safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of automated recognition and feedback for endotracheal suctioning training, especially in home and educational settings with limited supervision, where conventional ML/DL approaches underperform.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with a central LLM performing spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis on video data; enables natural-language feedback generation. Includes a pilot student-support module based on anomaly detection and XAI to provide interpretable guidance highlighting correct actions and improvements.

Result: Experimental results indicate the approach outperforms baseline models with approximately 15–20% gains in both accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, improving training efficiency, and enhancing patient safety through automated recognition and natural-language feedback.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented, heterogeneous computing resources across edge hierarchies hinder individual LLM agents from performing complex reasoning; there is a need for distributed collaboration among LLMs to exploit edge resources efficiently in 6G settings.

Method: Deploy multiple LLMs on mobile devices and tiered edge servers, assign each a distinct functional role, and integrate three optimization modules: real-time perception, dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution. Introduce a role affinity scheduling algorithm to dynamically assign LLM roles across the edge hierarchy, matching computational demands to available resources.

Result: Through case studies and performance evaluations in diverse 6G scenarios, CORE improves system efficiency and task completion rates; results are validated on a real-world edge platform, showing robust performance in operational environments.

Conclusion: CORE demonstrates a practical, scalable approach to collaborative AI at the edge, enabling rapid, efficient multi-agent LLM reasoning across distributed resources in 6G networks.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

*Francesca Filice,Edoardo De Rose,Simone Bartucci,Francesco Calimeri,Simona Perri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a comprehensive benchmarking framework for ECG-expert Foundation Models that adds representation-level analysis (SHAP, UMAP) to performance benchmarks, evaluated across diverse cross-continental datasets and data-scarcity settings to assess generalizability of embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that existing benchmarks focus on downstream performance, by evaluating how generalizable the embeddings produced by ECG-expert FMs are, ensuring safe and effective deployment in error-sensitive healthcare settings.

Method: Develops a benchmark methodology that combines traditional performance evaluation with representation-level analysis using SHAP and UMAP; applies it to several ECG-expert FMs pretrained with state-of-the-art techniques across multiple datasets with varying availability and cross-continental splits.

Result: The protocol yields rich insights into the embedded representation patterns and generalizability of ECG-expert FMs, revealing aspects not captured by performance alone.

Conclusion: The benchmarking framework enables deeper understanding of the representational structure of ECG-expert FMs and their generalizability, supporting more responsible and robust use in ECG interpretation.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decision-centric simulation framework links forecasting to inventory management in automotive aftermarket, showing that forecast accuracy alone does not guarantee better operational performance; it enables evaluating models by operational KPIs via a closed-loop simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecast accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE) may not reflect the impact on inventory KPIs (cost, service level). There is a need to evaluate forecasting models within a realistic inventory management context to understand trade-offs and improve model selection.

Method: Develop a decision-centric simulation software framework with three components: (i) a synthetic spare-parts demand generator, (ii) a flexible forecasting module for arbitrary models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that uses forecasts to compute KPIs in a closed-loop setup.

Result: Demonstrates that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not always translate to better operational performance; models with similar statistical error can cause different cost-service trade-offs. The framework reveals how forecast aspects affect inventory outcomes and provides guidance for model selection.

Conclusion: The framework operationalizes the demand-forecasting–inventory-management linkage and shifts evaluation from predictive accuracy to operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

*Jinhao Pan,Chahat Raj,Anjishnu Mukherjee,Sina Mansouri,Bowen Wei,Shloka Yada,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowBias is a lightweight, inference-time debiasing method that strengthens, rather than suppresses, bias-related knowledge by identifying bias-knowledge neurons through attribution-based analysis on a small set of bias-knowledge questions and selectively enhancing them—achieving strong debiasing with minimal impact on general capability without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debiasing LLMs with suppression (parameter, prompt, or neuron-level edits) often yields brittle, data-inefficient solutions that degrade overall capabilities. There is a need for a data-efficient, generalizable method that preserves general performance while reducing biased outputs.

Method: Identify neurons encoding bias knowledge using attribution-based analysis on a small set of bias-knowledge questions. At inference time, selectively enhance these neurons (no retraining). This lightweight approach strengthens the bias-knowledge pathways to reduce biased behavior.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs show consistent state-of-the-art debiasing with minimal utility degradation. The method is data-efficient (requires only a handful of yes/no questions) and does not require retraining; data and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: KnowBias demonstrates that debiasing can be achieved by strengthening bias-knowledge representations rather than suppressing biased behavior, yielding robust, generalizable, and data-efficient improvements with preserved general capabilities across biases and demographics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

Motivation: Addresses long-horizon, sequential decision-making in web tasks with sparse, delayed rewards; existing WebPRMs are coarse, brittle, and poorly interpretable.

Method: Introduces WebArbiter, a reasoning-first WebPRM with two-stage training: reasoning distillation to acquire principled reasoning, then reinforcement learning to align verdicts with correctness. The model generates structured justifications that end with a preference verdict and identifies the action most conducive to task completion. Evaluation uses WebPRMBench and WebArena-Lite for reward-guided trajectory search.

Result: WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline (GPT-5) by 9.1 points on WebPRMBench. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robustness and practical value for complex web tasks, provides a comprehensive WebPRMBench benchmark, and advances state-of-the-art in reward-model-based web navigation.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

### [170] [Making Models Unmergeable via Scaling-Sensitive Loss Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21898)
*Minwoo Jang,Hoyoung Kim,Jabin Koo,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trap^2 is an architecture-agnostic protection framework that embeds protection into fine-tuning updates via weight scaling, preserving standalone use but degrading under weight re-scaling common in merging, to prevent unauthorized model merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model hubs enable recombination of released weights, creating a governance gap where safety alignment or licensing terms can be bypassed. Existing defenses are architecture-specific and post-hoc, failing to provide consistent protection across architectures and release formats.

Method: Trap^2 encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning. It uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process, so protection is architecture-agnostic and independent of adapters vs full models. Released weights remain usable standalone, but re-scaling during merging reduces their effectiveness.

Result: Protection that preserves standalone usefulness while degrading under typical re-scaling merges, thereby undermining unauthorized merging. Architecture-agnostic and compatible with adapters or full-model releases.

Conclusion: Trap^2 closes the governance gap by providing a lightweight, architecture-agnostic defense against unauthorized recombination of model components through weight scaling, addressing limitations of architecture-dependent post-hoc defenses.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

### [171] [From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cognitively-inspired two-stage post-training framework (CoMT for abstract meta-knowledge and CCRL for confident task adaptation) improves generalization and efficiency vs standard SFT+RL across multiple models/benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories, conflating abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. Humans solve problems by first acquiring abstract, generalizable strategies and then adapting them to instances; aligning training with this two-stage process can reduce error cascades and improve generalization.

Method: Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) uses supervised learning to capture abstract reasoning patterns (meta-knowledge) without solving specific tasks; Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) optimizes adaptation with confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps to prevent overconfident errors and improve execution reliability.

Result: Experiments over four models and eight benchmarks show improvements of 2.19% (in-distribution) and 4.63% (out-of-distribution); training time reduced by 65–70% and token consumption by 50%.

Conclusion: Aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields better generalization and efficiency, demonstrating the viability of a two-stage, cognitively-inspired post-training paradigm.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

### [172] [ProRAG: Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21912)
*Zhao Wang,Ziliang Zhao,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProRAG introduces a process-supervised RL framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation to tackle reward sparsity and process hallucinations by providing step-level feedback through an MCTS-based Process Reward Model and a four-stage training pipeline that blends supervised warmup, process rewards, and RL with dual-granularity signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional outcome-only RL struggles with long-horizon tasks in RAG due to sparse rewards and poor credit assignment; process-aware methods lack on-policy exploration to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes, leading to process hallucinations and inefficient optimization.

Method: ProRAG comprises four stages: (1) supervised policy warmup to instill structured reasoning; (2) build an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning; (3) PRM-guided reasoning refinement to align policy with process preferences; (4) process-supervised RL with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism that aggregates step-level rewards with global outcomes during online learning.

Result: On five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, ProRAG achieves superior performance compared with strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, especially on complex long-horizon tasks; results validate the benefit of fine-grained process supervision and integrated step-level feedback.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, on-policy process supervision via a PRM-guided, dual-granularity RL framework can effectively mitigate process hallucinations and reward sparsity in RAG, enabling more accurate, efficient, and robust long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG.

*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Tianyi Hu,Shijie Wang,Zixuan Yang,Meizhi Zhong,Xiaochi Wei,Yan Gao,Yi Wu,Yao Hu,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JADE introduces joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic, multi-turn retrieval-augmented workflows, enabling co-adaptation between planner and executors via a shared backbone and outcome-based rewards, yielding performance gains over decoupled designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG pipelines either optimize components within fixed architectures or dynamic plans with frozen executors, leading to a strategic-operational mismatch where sophisticated planning cannot realize gains due to unadapted executors; this limits efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: JADE models the system as a cooperative multi-agent team under a single shared backbone, enabling end-to-end learning with outcome-based rewards to jointly optimize planning and execution and promote co-adaptation between planners and executors.

Result: Empirical results show JADE converts disjoint modules into a synergistic system, achieving notable performance improvements through joint optimization and providing a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness via dynamic workflow orchestration.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with JADE mitigates decoupled optimization limitations, aligning planning and execution to unlock improved performance in dynamic, multi-turn workflows.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent RL framework (SCMA) uses a Segmentation Agent and a Scoring Agent to apply an importance-weighted length penalty, reducing reasoning overhead while improving accuracy in Large Reasoning Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference overhead from redundant reasoning in large models degrades interactivity; simplistic length penalties conflict with preserving essential reasoning steps.

Method: Propose Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA) with two specialized agents (Segmentation and Scoring) that decompose reasoning into chunks and assess their significance, collaboratively shaping an importance-weighted penalty to train a Reasoning Agent.

Result: SCMA reduces response length by 11.1% to 39.0% and increases accuracy by 4.33% to 10.02% across model scales; ablations and qualitative analysis show emergent beneficial behavior and improved performance over vanilla RL.

Conclusion: A coordinated MARL framework effectively trims redundant reasoning without sacrificing, and often improving, accuracy, indicating a robust approach to reducing inference overhead in LRMs.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

*Jon Chun,Kathrine Elkins,Yong Suk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgenticSimLaw introduces a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework for transparent, auditable high-stakes decision making, evaluated on recidivism prediction and outperforming chain-of-thought prompting across many configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle opacity, fragility, and governance gaps in single-agent LLM reasoning by enabling auditable, controllable, and transparent deliberations in high-stakes tasks.

Method: Courtroom-style orchestration with prosecutor, defense, and judge, 7-turn structured debate, private reasoning strategies, full interaction logs; evaluation on NLSY97 recidivism data against chain-of-thought prompts across ~90 model/strategy combos.

Result: Structured multi-agent debate yields more stable, generalizable performance with stronger accuracy–F1 correlation; provides complete transcripts, fine-grained control, and behavior profiling; results and code to be released under MIT license.

Conclusion: Addresses organization, observability, and responsibility challenges in LLM-based multi-agent systems; generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and oversight; enables governance-ready reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains. Data, results, and code will be available on github.com under the MIT license.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeR2 is a controlled sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning from retrieval to measure true reasoning on novel science; it uses four regimes, two-phase validation, and a fixed 2023–2025 paper library to enable interpretable error attribution and reveal headroom in foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-to-end RAG benchmarks conflate retrieval, tool use, and memorization with reasoning, obscuring true multi-step scientific reasoning. A controlled, reproducible benchmark is needed to isolate reasoning difficulty and diagnose failures in LM-based research.

Method: Introduce four regimes (Instruction-only, Concepts, Related-only, Full-set) to separate access to evidence from reasoning. Use two-phase validation to prevent parametric leakage. Provide a frozen document library of recent theoretical papers with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Evaluate diverse state-of-the-art foundation models on multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusions, with regime gaps to attribute errors (retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss).

Result: Significant variation across models and substantial headroom remain. Some models exhibit mode-switch fragility (performing worse with Full-set than Instruction-only), while others show structural concept misuse (correct concept naming but failure to execute them as procedures).

Conclusion: DeR2 offers a principled, interpretable framework to diagnose and quantify retrieval versus reasoning limitations in LM-based science reasoning, highlighting both model fragility and opportunities for targeted improvements and more robust evaluation.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolWeaver encodes tools as hierarchical sequences to replace monolithic IDs, enabling logarithmic vocabulary growth, better generalization, and learning of collaborative tool relationships from dense shared codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-based tool-use pipelines and LLMs suffer from limited semantic understanding of tools and poor scalability; mapping each tool to a unique token causes vocabulary explosion and semantic bottlenecks, hindering generalization across tools and their relationships.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical tool-tokenization scheme that weaves intrinsic tool semantics with extrinsic co-usage patterns to form structured codes. These codes are integrated into the LLM via a generative alignment stage, guiding the model to produce hierarchical code sequences when selecting tools.

Result: On a benchmark of ~47,000 tools, ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved scalability, generalization, and semantic awareness for tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, semantically-informed tool codes enable scalable learning of tool relationships and improved tool usage by LLMs, providing a robust foundation for large-scale, tool-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

### [178] [How do Visual Attributes Influence Web Agents? A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21961)
*Kuai Yu,Naicheng Yu,Han Wang,Rui Yang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAF is a controlled evaluation pipeline that quantifies how visual webpage attributes influence web-agent decision-making. It identifies background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity as strong influencers, while font styling, text color, and image clarity have weaker effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited systematic understanding of how benign visual attributes affect web-agent behavior; prior work focuses on robustness to adversarial attacks or textual attributes. A controlled, semantic-preserving variant-generation approach is needed to isolate visual factors.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (i) variant generation ensuring semantic equivalence while altering visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction simulating human-like scrolling and clicking; (iii) validation using Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to measure impact, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites, and 4 representative web agents.

Result: From experiments, background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity strongly influence agent actions; font styling, text color, and item image clarity show minor effects; the findings enable ranking of visual factors by their influence on decision-making.

Conclusion: VAF provides a quantitative, controlled methodology to study visual factors in web-agent decision-making, enabling more robust agent and page design in benign settings and guiding future research on perceptual biases and layout effects.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

### [179] [The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21967)
*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Domain-model design affects energy use in classical planners; across 5 domains and 5 planners, 32 variants each show energy differences that do not always align with runtime, suggesting energy-aware domain design can improve Green AI in planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglected energy efficiency dimension in automated planning (Green AI) by exploiting the modular separation of domain models and planners to study how domain features affect energy consumption.

Method: Introduce a domain model configuration framework to systematically vary features (element ordering, action arity, dead-end states). Evaluate 5 benchmark domains with 5 state‑of‑the‑art planners, analyzing energy and runtime across 32 variants per domain.

Result: Domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners; energy consumption does not always correlate with runtime, indicating distinct energy behavior and planner sensitivity to domain features.

Conclusion: Domain design is a viable lever to reduce energy use in automated planning; energy-aware domain modeling should be explored further, as energy and runtime can diverge and planners respond differently to domain features.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

### [180] [Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972)
*Shuo Liu,Tianle Chen,Ryan Amiri,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAAC-based CoLLM methods for decentralized LLM collaboration; compares centralized vs decentralized critics; performance depends on horizon and reward density; Decentralized critics offer parallelism but can struggle with convergence in long/horizon sparse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on predefined centralized execution protocols; address high variance of Monte Carlo fines; enable decentralized, parallel LLM collaboration using actor-critic MARL.

Method: Introduce two MAAC approaches: CoLLM-CC with a centralized critic and CoLLM-DC with decentralized critics. Analyze when and why MAAC helps; evaluate across writing, coding, and game-playing domains; compare with Monte Carlo baselines.

Result: CoLLM-DC and Monte Carlo methods can match CoLLM-CC in short-horizon/dense-reward settings; both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks; Monte Carlo requires more samples; CoLLM-DC struggles to converge in those tougher settings; code available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Centralized critic (CoLLM-CC) offers stronger performance in challenging long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, while decentralized critics (CoLLM-DC) enable decentralization and sample efficiency in favorable settings but may converge issues in hard tasks; results highlight trade-offs between decentralization, convergence, and sample efficiency in MAAC-based LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

### [181] [Mind the Gap: How Elicitation Protocols Shape the Stated-Revealed Preference Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21975)
*Pranav Mahajan,Ihor Kendiukhov,Syed Hussain,Lydia Nottingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SvR (stated-revealed) preference correlation in LMs is highly sensitive to elicitation protocol; neutrality and abstention alter correlation, while abstention in revealed preferences can destroy it; system-prompt steering shows limited reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how elicitation design (allowing neutrality/abstention, abstention in revealed prefs, system prompt steering) impacts the alignment between what LMs say they value and what they actually choose in tasks, across many models.

Method: Systematic experimental study across 24 LMs comparing stated-preference elicitation with and without neutrality/abstention; compute Spearman correlations between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences; explore abstention in revealed prefs; test system-prompt steering on AIRiskDilemmas.

Result: Allowing neutrality during stated elicitation substantially increases ρ by excluding weak signals; permitting abstention in stated prefs further improves or maintains ρ for some settings but abstention in revealed prefs drives ρ toward zero or negative due to high neutrality rates; system-prompt steering using stated prefs does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

Conclusion: SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent; methods must account for indeterminate preferences. Current forced-choice elicitation risks conflating genuine preferences with elicitation artifacts; robust assessment requires incorporating indeterminacy signals (neutrality/abstention) and careful design of revealed-preference tasks.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

### [182] [VERSA: Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21981)
*Geonhee Jo,Mingu Kang,Kangmin Lee,Minho Lee,Pascal Bauer,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VERSA is a state-transition–based verification framework for soccer event streams that detects and corrects logical inconsistencies, improving data reliability and downstream VAEP performance; applied to Bepro K League 1 2024 data with 18.81% inconsistencies and improved cross-provider consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-stream data quality issues cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., ordering, missing events), undermining analytics; a formal verification framework is needed to ensure data integrity for reliable downstream tasks.

Method: Propose VERSA, a verification framework built on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences; automatically detects and corrects anomalous patterns in the event stream; evaluate on real-world data (K League 1 2024 from Bepro); quantify inconsistencies, cross-provider consistency, and downstream impact on VAEP.

Result: Found 18.81% of events with logical inconsistencies in Bepro-supplied K League 1 (2024); VERSA improves cross-provider consistency and yields more robust performance for the VAEP player-contribution task after data refinement.

Conclusion: Verification via a state-transition model significantly enhances the reliability of soccer event data and improves downstream analytics like VAEP; approach supports unified representation across heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

### [183] [Liquid Interfaces: A Dynamic Ontology for the Interoperability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21993)
*Dhiogo de Sá,Carlos Schmiedel,Carlos Pereira Lopes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Liquid Interfaces propose ephemeral, intention-driven interfaces and the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP) to enable adaptive, context-aware coordination among autonomous agents; the work provides a formal model, governance considerations, and a reference architecture to demonstrate feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional software architectures rely on static interfaces and deterministic contracts, which impede adaptive, probabilistic, context-dependent agent reasoning. There is a need for runtime, semantic negotiation that yields ephemeral interfaces to support flexible coordination.

Method: Formalize the coordination model; develop the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP) governing intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and ephemerality under semantic uncertainty; discuss governance implications; present a reference architecture to demonstrate practical feasibility.

Result: A formal model and protocol for ephemeral, intention-based interactions; governance considerations; and a reference architecture showing practical feasibility for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in contemporary agent-based software systems.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

### [184] [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22001)
*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) to explain memory-related bottlenecks in large-scale AI inference, revealing the memory capacity wall and motivating disaggregated, heterogeneous architectures and agent-hardware co-design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic roofline analyses miss memory capacity constraints that become critical for agentic AI workloads with long-context caches. There is a need for metrics that capture the interplay of memory footprint and bandwidth across diverse workflows and model types.

Method: Define and apply two metrics, OI and CF, across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model families (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization). Analyze how long context KV caches influence memory-bound decoding and argue for disaggregated serving, specialized accelerators, and system-level heterogeneity; hypothesize agent-hardware co-design with multiple accelerators and memory disaggregation via high-bandwidth I/O.

Result: OI/CF explain regimes not captured by traditional roofline, showing that memory capacity and bandwidth dominate in many agentic workloads, especially with long-context KV caches. Observations support disaggregated serving and heterogeneous architectures, including prefill/decode accelerators, broader networking, and optical I/O, as foundations for scalable inference.

Conclusion: Encourage agent-hardware co-design with multiple accelerators per system and high-bandwidth, large-capacity memory disaggregation to adapt to evolving OI/CF, charting a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large-scale agentic AI inference.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### [185] [CAR-bench: Evaluating the Consistency and Limit-Awareness of LLM Agents under Real-World Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22027)
*Johannes Kirmayr,Lukas Stappen,Elisabeth André*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAR-bench evaluates reliability of multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant; introduces Hallucination and Disambiguation tasks; baseline results reveal major reliability gaps in consistency, uncertainty handling, and policy adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks emphasize task completion under idealized conditions, but real-world, user-facing applications involve incomplete/ambiguous requests and intrinsic uncertainty. There is a need for self-aware, policy-compliant agents that can manage uncertainty in dialogue and tool use.

Method: An environment with an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Multi-turn interactions assess consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness. Hallucination tasks test limit-awareness under missing tools/information; Disambiguation tasks require clarification or internal information gathering.

Result: Baseline results show sizable gaps between occasional and consistent success across tasks. Even frontier LLMs achieve <50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information in Hallucination tasks, highlighting reliability and self-awareness deficiencies.

Conclusion: CAR-bench reveals critical reliability and self-awareness gaps in current LLM agents operating in realistic, tool-using, multi-turn scenarios; findings point to directions for improving consistency, uncertainty handling, policy adherence, and tool-use governance.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

### [186] [Routing the Lottery: Adaptive Subnetworks for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22141)
*Grzegorz Stefanski,Alberto Presta,Michal Byra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RTL proposes adaptive tickets—multiple specialized subnetworks for heterogeneous data, routing inputs to the appropriate subnetwork to improve performance with far fewer parameters; reveals subnetwork collapse and introduces a similarity score for diagnosing oversparsification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning's Lottery Ticket Hypothesis shows sparse winning tickets exist but typically assumes a single universal ticket, ignoring data heterogeneity. There is a need for modular, context-aware pruning that aligns subnetworks with different data contexts.

Method: Introduce Routing the Lottery (RTL); learn multiple adaptive tickets for distinct contexts (classes, semantic clusters, environments); incorporate a routing mechanism to select the suitable subnetwork; analyze subnetwork similarity; identify subnetwork collapse under aggressive pruning.

Result: RTL outperforms single- and multi-model baselines across tasks and datasets in balanced accuracy and recall; uses up to 10x fewer parameters than independent models; subnetworks are semantically aligned with their contexts; introduce a label-free diagnosis tool (subnetwork similarity score).

Conclusion: Pruning can be framed as structuring model capacity to match data heterogeneity, enabling modular, context-aware networks and more efficient deployment.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

### [187] [Optimizing Agentic Workflows using Meta-tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22037)
*Sami Abuzakuk,Anne-Marie Kermarrec,Rishi Sharma,Rasmus Moorits Veski,Martijn de Vos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AWO identifies and composes recurring tool-call patterns into meta-tools to optimize agentic AI workflows, reducing LLM usage and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI workflows incur high latency, cost, and hallucination risk due to iterative reasoning and numerous tool invocations; there is a need to improve efficiency and reliability.

Method: Analyze workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls; transform these sequences into deterministic, composite meta-tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation, bypassing intermediate reasoning steps when possible.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two agentic AI benchmarks shows up to 11.9% reduction in LLM calls and up to 4.2 percentage-point gains in task success rate.

Conclusion: Meta-tools reduce intermediate reasoning, lower operational cost, shorten execution paths, and improve robustness, without sacrificing—and possibly improving—task performance.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

### [188] [Defining Operational Conditions for Safety-Critical AI-Based Systems from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22118)
*Johann Christensen,Elena Hoemann,Frank Köster,Sven Hallerbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven, kernel-based method to define the Operational Design Domain (ODD) after data collection, enabling certification of AI systems in safety-critical contexts by equating the learned ODD with the original hidden ODD; validated via Monte Carlo simulations and an aviation use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODD descriptions are difficult to obtain for complex, real-world systems, yet certification requires a precise, verifiable ODD. A posteriori, data-driven ODDs can fill gaps when expert-based ODDs are incomplete.

Method: Proposes a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation to define the ODD from data post hoc. Validates with Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation collision-avoidance case. Establishes conditions under which two ODDs are equal, showing data-driven ODD can equal the underlying hidden ODD.

Result: Demonstrates that the data-driven ODD can be equal to the original ODD of the data. The approach supports certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI systems via Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD.

Conclusion: A Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD framework enables certification of data-driven safety-critical AI systems by deriving and validating a posteriori ODDs from data and proving conditions for ODD equivalence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

*Lakshya Gupta,Litao Li,Yizhe Liu,Sriram Ganapathi Subramanian,Kaheer Suleman,Zichen Zhang,Haoye Lu,Sumit Pasupalak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WoW introduces a realistic enterprise environment and benchmark revealing dynamics blindness in frontier LLMs; effective enterprise agents require grounded world modeling to infer hidden state transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise systems exhibit hidden workflows, limited observability, and cascading side effects across large databases. Existing benchmarks assess surface-level task completion and fail to capture core enterprise dynamics.

Method: Develop World of Workflows (WoW), a ServiceNow-based, rule-rich environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows; accompany with WoW-bench, a 234-task benchmark to evaluate constrained task completion and dynamics modeling in enterprise contexts.

Result: Two main findings: (1) Frontier LLMs struggle to predict invisible, cascading side effects, leading to silent constraint violations; (2) reliable performance in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling and mental simulation of hidden state transitions when feedback is scarce.

Conclusion: WoW advocates a new paradigm centered on explicit learning of system dynamics for reliable enterprise agents; authors provide a GitHub resource to set up and evaluate WoW.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

TL;DR: Agent-RRM introduces structured feedback signals for agentic reasoning and explores three integration strategies, with Reagent-U achieving notable gains on GAIA and WebWalkerQA across 12 benchmarks; resources released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparsity and late feedback in reward signals that hinder intermediate reasoning quality in agentic RL.

Method: Proposes Agent Reasoning Reward Model with three components: explicit reasoning trace, focused critique, overall score. Evaluates three integration strategies: Reagent-C, Reagent-R, Reagent-U across 12 benchmarks.

Result: Reagent-U yields substantial performance gains; GAIA 43.7%, WebWalkerQA 46.2% (presumably accuracy). Code/models/datasets released.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning feedback improves agentic RL; unified feedback integration is most effective; releases enable reproducibility.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.

*Rongzheng Wang,Yihong Huang,Muquan Li,Jiakai Li,Di Liang,Bob Simons,Pei Ke,Shuang Liang,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASH introduces a dynamics-aware, convergence-guided LHD framework with Profiled Library Retrieval to improve efficiency and adaptation across heterogeneous distributions, achieving >3x runtime speedups and >90% reduction in adaptation costs while outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LHD approaches rely on endpoint (final-quality) evaluation and require costly re-adaptation when instance distributions shift. There is a need to incorporate convergence dynamics and reusable solvers to improve efficiency and robustness.

Method: Co-optimizes solver search strategies and runtime schedules under a convergence-aware metric. It uses Profiled Library Retrieval to archive specialized solvers during evolutionary search, enabling warm starts for diverse/heterogeneous instances.

Result: Empirical results on four combinatorial optimization problems show runtime improvements exceeding 3x and superior solution quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines across problem scales. Profile-based warm starts preserve accuracy under distribution shifts and reduce LLM adaptation costs by more than 90%.

Conclusion: DASH provides a scalable, convergence-aware framework for LLM-driven heuristic design, combining dynamic solver/search optimization with reusable, profiled solvers to boost efficiency and robustness across problem distributions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

*Atik Faysal,Mohammad Rostami,Reihaneh Gh. Roshan,Nikhil Muralidhar,Huaxia Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP) biases multimodal pretraining toward a designated target modality at fine-tuning time by increasing masking difficulty, loss weighting, and decoder capacity for that modality, without changing the shared encoder or adding supervision, improving downstream performance in masked modeling on wireless signal constellation diagrams; model-agnostic and broadly applicable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many deployments, a single modality dominates downstream tasks. Uniform multimodal pretraining may under-prepare representations for this important modality. FIP aims to align pretraining with downstream modality requirements.

Method: FIP increases three aspects for the target modality during masked modeling: (1) higher masking difficulty, (2) stronger loss weighting, and (3) increased decoder capacity for the target modality. These changes apply to the target modality only, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision, making the approach model-agnostic.

Result: Applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance without extra data or compute. It is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Conclusion: FIP offers a simple, effective, and generalizable strategy to bias multimodal pretraining toward the modality that matters at fine-tuning time, improving downstream performance while preserving training efficiency and compatibility.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

### [193] [A generative machine learning model for designing metal hydrides applied to hydrogen storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20892)
*Xiyuan Liu,Christian Hacker,Shengnian Wang,Yuhua Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal-discovery–driven, lightweight generative ML framework expands metal hydride candidates beyond existing databases, yielding six new formulas/structures (four DFT-validated) from 450 samples, accelerating hydrogen storage materials discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current materials databases lack comprehensive hydride coverage, restricting discovery of optimal hydrogen storage materials; a scalable method to explore unexplored chemical space is needed.

Method: Combine causal discovery with a lightweight generative ML model; train on 450 samples (270/90/90), generate 1,000 candidates, rank/filter, identify novel formulas/structures, and validate via density functional theory (DFT) for four promising cases.

Result: Identified six previously unreported candidates; four pass DFT validation and show strong potential for experiments; demonstrates a scalable, time-efficient path for expanding hydrogen storage datasets.

Conclusion: The framework can accelerate discovery of metal hydrides and help overcome database limitations; further work includes experimental validation and exploration of generalizability to broader chemistries.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

### [194] [Is Parameter Isolation Better for Prompt-Based Continual Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20894)
*Jiangyang Li,Chenhao Ding,Songlin Dong,Qiang Wang,Jianchao Zhao,Yuhang He,Yihong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prompt-sharing continual learning framework with a global prompt pool, task-aware gated routing, and a history-aware modulator; it dynamically decouples tasks and improves efficiency, outperforming static prompt allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, per-task prompt allocations waste parameters and isolate knowledge, hindering cross-task knowledge transfer and efficient utilization.

Method: Construct a global pool of prompts; employ a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts for each task to enable dynamic decoupling and collaborative feature optimization; introduce a history-aware modulator that uses cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, mitigating inefficient parameter usage and forgetting.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in both effectiveness and efficiency across continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic prompt sharing with gating routing and history-aware modulation provides better parameter utilization and resilience against forgetting compared to fixed, task-isolated prompt allocations.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: A new initialization strategy for predictive coding networks preserves iterative progress across samples, substantially speeding convergence and improving final performance in supervised and unsupervised tasks, addressing computational efficiency gaps with backprop.


<details>

Motivation: Energy-based, predictive coding networks are promising but computationally heavy due to iterative inference. Initialization can influence convergence speed; bridging predictive coding with backprop requires efficiency gains.

Method: Introduce a novel initialization technique that preserves the iterative progress from previous training samples when starting inference for a new sample, effectively warm-starting the dynamics of predictive coding networks.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: Initialization-aware training can reconcile predictive coding with backprop-like efficiency, offering a practical path to scalable energy-based learning and faster convergence.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TwinWeaver converts longitudinal patient histories into text to enable unified event prediction with LLMs; Genie Digital Twin (GDT) trained on 93k patients across 20 cancer types improves forecasting accuracy (lower MASE) and risk stratification (higher C-index), and generalizes to out-of-distribution trials, with an interpretable reasoning extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting clinical events from sparse, multi-modal clinical time series is difficult; a scalable framework is needed to leverage large language models for longitudinal oncology data.

Method: Serialize longitudinal clinical histories into text using TwinWeaver, then apply LLM-based prediction and forecasting on GDT across multiple tasks (event prediction, survival/progression/therapy-switching risk). Evaluate using MASE and C-index; test zero-shot/generalization to clinical trials; provide an interpretable clinical reasoning extension.

Result: GDT achieves median MASE of 0.87 vs 0.97 for strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001); average C-index 0.703 across tasks vs 0.662 baseline; zero-shot median MASE 0.75-0.88 and C-index 0.672 vs 0.648 baseline; demonstrates generalization to unseen trials and an interpretable framework.

Conclusion: TwinWeaver offers a scalable, transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling with LLMs, enabling improved forecasting, risk stratification, and generalization across oncology tasks.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noisy but Valid: a principled hypothesis-testing framework to certify LLM safety under imperfect judges by calibrating judge error rates and applying a variance-corrected threshold to large judge-labeled data, achieving finite-sample validity and improved power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable certification of LLM safety is hindered by judge imperfections (noise, bias). Existing Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is black-box and lacks explicit modeling of judge behavior. A principled method that accounts for judge reliability is needed.

Method: Calibrate the judge using a small human-labeled set to estimate True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). Derive a variance-corrected critical threshold and apply it to a large judge-labeled dataset. Provide finite-sample Type-I error control despite calibration uncertainty. Frame as diagnostic that models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Compare with PPI.

Result: Theoretical guarantees under finite-sample settings, showing conditions where noisy testing yields higher power than direct evaluation. Empirical validation on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech, and SafeRLHF corroborates theory. Introduces the Oracle Gap—the performance gap between practical methods and the hypothetical oracle with perfectly known judge parameters. Delivers interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifies how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification level.

Conclusion: Presents the first systematic treatment of imperfect-judge evaluation, enabling interpretable assessment of judge reliability, quantifying the cost of estimation, and clarifying the trade-offs among evaluation tools for LLM safety certification.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

*Anni Zhao,Ayca Ermis,Jeffrey Robert Vitt,Sergio Brasil,Wellingson Paiva,Magdalena Kasprowicz,Malgorzata Burzynska,Robert Hamilton,Runze Yan,Ofer Sadan,J. Claude Hemphill,Lieven Vandenberghe,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noninvasive ICP estimation via a hybrid ML framework combining subspace system identification and ranking-constrained optimization; achieves ~32% within 2 mmHg and ~34% within 2–6 mmHg on test data, suggesting feasibility but requiring further validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate, noninvasive, bedside ICP monitoring to replace or supplement invasive methods in acute brain injury, addressing critical care needs and patient safety.

Method: Build cerebral hemodynamics models with subspace system identification using ABP, CBv, and R-R signals; learn a convex, ranking-constrained nonlinear mapping from signal features to ICP estimation errors; evaluate on randomly split training/testing cohorts.

Result: On testing data, 31.88% of entries have estimation error ≤ 2 mmHg; 34.07% have error between 2 and 6 mmHg; overall demonstration of feasibility, with a substantial portion of cases achieving clinically acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach shows feasibility for noninvasive mean ICP estimation; requires comprehensive external validation, comparison with existing methods, and refinement for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

*Steve Hanneke,Shay Moran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Complete tetrachotomy for universal agnostic rates in binary classification; rates depend on simple combinatorial structures of the concept class; four regimes: e^{-n}, e^{-o(n)}, o(n^{-1/2}), or arbitrarily slow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the theory from the realizable setting to the agnostic setting with distribution-free optimal rates; identify the structural determinants of rate regimes.

Method: Theoretical analysis of excess error convergence under universal (distribution-free) settings; classify concept classes using combinatorial structures; derive the four-rate dichotomy/ tetrachotomy and map classes to regimes; generalize prior realizable-case results.

Result: Establishes a complete four-way classification (tetrachotomy) of optimal universal convergence rates for excess error in agnostic binary classification and identifies simple combinatorial structures that determine the regime for a given class.

Conclusion: Advances fundamental understanding of learnability limits in agnostic binary classification and provides a structural framework to predict the rate regime for a given concept class, guiding both theory and potential algorithm design.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [200] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learns the projection step of Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) for monotone optimization via Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, replacing costly bisection with a learned radial inverse predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: POA-style global solvers require explicit objective/constraint functions, which may be data-driven. The work aims to enable data-driven, fast projection by integrating learned models that respect monotonicity and homogeneity, reducing compute while maintaining feasibility and quality.

Method: Develop HM-RI networks that enforce monotonicity and homogeneity to predict the radial inverse projection; provide a theoretical characterization showing HM-RI corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid monotone constraint set under mild conditions; introduce relaxed monotonicity to ease training; integrate the predictor into POA and evaluate on indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimization.

Result: Significant speed-ups over direct function estimation while preserving solution quality; HM-RI-based predictions outperform baselines that do not exploit monotone structure; effective across multiple monotone optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Learning-augmented POA with structure-aware projection yields fast, reliable solutions for monotone optimization and illustrates the value of embedding problem structure into neural predictors for optimization subroutines.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

*Abdullah Akgül,Gulcin Baykal,Manuel Haußmann,Mustafa Mert Çelikok,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A formal abstraction unifies model-based, distributional, and model-free RL with active inference, enabling AI to reap active inference's benefits within a distributional RL framework without modeling transition dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic optimal control suffers from two intertwined challenges: efficient sensory-state organization and long-horizon action planning. RL addresses only planning and tends to be sample-inefficient; active inference explains how brains handle both, but AI usage has been limited to extensions of model-based approaches.

Method: Introduce a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free paradigms and integrate active inference into the distributional RL framework without requiring explicit transition dynamics modeling.

Result: A theoretical unification that makes active inference advantages accessible within distributional RL, eliminating the need for explicit transition dynamics modeling while covering multiple RL paradigms.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled bridge between active inference and RL, offering a path toward more sample-efficient, long-horizon control in complex environments.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Globally pre-trained encoder for child development enabling few-shot ML in SDG 4.2.1 with diverse UNICEF data; strong cross-country generalization and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data bottleneck for ML in new countries by providing a general-purpose encoder trained on a large, diverse dataset to improve performance with limited local data.

Method: Train a pre-trained encoder on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. Use the encoder in a downstream classifier; evaluate AUC at small (N=50) and moderate (N=500) sample sizes, and in zero-shot deployment to unseen countries. Compare to cold-start gradient boosting and apply a transfer-learning bound to explain diversity-driven generalization.

Result: With N=50, AUC=0.65 (95% CI: 0.56–0.72); gradient boosting AUC=0.61 (8–12% advantage for the encoder). With N=500, AUC=0.73. Zero-shot AUCs up to 0.84 in unseen countries.

Conclusion: Pre-trained encoders enable feasible ML-based SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings; diverse training data underpins strong few-shot generalization, supported by a transfer-learning bound.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

### [203] [Top-k on a Budget: Adaptive Ranking with Weak and Strong Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20989)
*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-oracle top-k identification framework leveraging a fast noisy weak oracle with confidence intervals and a costly strong oracle. Introduces ACE and ACE-W adaptive certification strategies that concentrate high-fidelity queries on boundary items, achieving near-optimal strong-query bounds tied to near-tie mass m(·) around the top-k threshold under weak uncertainty ε_max.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact valuations are expensive; reduce reliance on a costly strong oracle by exploiting a fast, noisy weak oracle with confidence intervals. Establish baseline STC bounds, derive lower bound, and develop adaptive algorithms (ACE, ACE-W) to minimize high-fidelity queries while preserving accuracy.

Method: 1) Screen-then-certify (STC) baseline analyzed under jointly valid weak confidence intervals with radius ε_max; bound on strong calls: ≤ m(4ε_max). 2) Prove a conditional Ω(m(ε_max)) lower bound for any algorithm with same weak uncertainty. 3) ACE: adaptive certification focusing strong queries on boundary items, attaining the same asymptotic bound with practical reductions in strong calls. 4) ACE-W: fully adaptive two-phase method allocating weak budget adaptively before ACE to further reduce strong costs.

Result: Upper bound: STC uses at most m(4ε_max) strong calls. Lower bound: any algorithm has Ω(m(ε_max)) strong calls under the same weak uncertainty. ACE achieves the same O(m(4ε_max)) bound but with fewer strong calls in practice. ACE-W further reduces strong costs by adaptively allocating the weak budget prior to ACE.

Conclusion: Adaptive certification strategies (ACE, ACE-W) nearly match the information-theoretic lower bound for strong-query complexity under a fixed weak uncertainty model, efficiently trading weak versus strong oracle usage by concentrating high-fidelity queries on boundary items and optimally allocating weak budget. This framework is practically beneficial for top-k identification when exact valuations are expensive.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

### [204] [The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994)
*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Architecture-conditioned scaling laws reveal that optimal depth and width scale differently with compute: D* ~ C^0.12 and W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width grows ~2.8x faster than depth; a critical depth D_crit ~ W^0.44 exists beyond which deeper models can worsen loss (Depth Delusion). Empirically validated across 30 transformers (17M–7B params) with R^2 = 0.922; at 7B scale, a 64-layer model underperforms a 32-layer model by 0.12 nats, confirming nontrivial depth-width tradeoffs at production scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scaling laws assume architecture is interchangeable; this work asks how depth and width interact with data and parameters to shape loss, and whether there exist architecture-aware scaling laws that predict optimal configurations.

Method: Propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws and fit them to empirical data. Derive optimal depth D* ~ C^0.12 and width W* ~ C^0.34; identify a critical depth D_crit ~ W^0.44 where additional layers increase loss; validate across 30 transformer architectures (17M–7B params) trained on representative high-compute samples; report fit quality (R^2).

Result: Width grows 2.8x faster than depth; existence of Depth Delusion where beyond D_crit adding layers raises loss; high predictive accuracy with R^2 = 0.922 across architectures; at 7B scale, 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, illustrating persistent depth-width tradeoffs at production scale.

Conclusion: Architecture-aware scaling laws are necessary; optimal depth-width configurations depend on compute and data; blindly stacking depth can harm performance beyond a critical point; results provide practical design guidance for scaling transformers.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADE introduces end-to-end, budget-constrained benchmarking of autonomous materials discovery pipelines via closed-loop simulations, enabling ablations and scaling analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static predictive tasks and sub-tasks, neglecting the iterative, adaptive, resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows; there is a need for standardized, end-to-end evaluation of autonomous materials discovery pipelines.

Method: Define MAD E as a simulation framework where an agent proposes candidates, evaluates them via a constrained oracle, and refines decisions to search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a convex hull. The framework uses a modular architecture with interchangeable components (generative models, filters, planners), enabling workflows from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use. Evaluation compares efficacy and efficiency against baselines, and supports ablations and scalability studies across families of systems.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated through systematic experiments across multiple system families. Ablation studies reveal the contributions of individual components, and scaling analyses illustrate how methods perform as system complexity grows, enabling comparative benchmarking.

Conclusion: MADE provides a flexible, reusable benchmark for end-to-end, adaptive materials discovery pipelines, supporting component-wise analysis, ablation studies, and scalability assessments, and promoting reproducible evaluation of autonomous discovery workflows.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarks place the solver in the evaluation loop for IR/OR problems, enabling verifiable feedback and iterative repair; domain-specific RLVR training improves performance beyond frontier APIs; curriculum training reduces ID→OOD bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OR/LLM benchmarks treat problem solving as one-shot translation and ignore the diagnostic loop of debugging infeasible models. There is a need for process-aware evaluation with verifiable feedback to train models to perform iterative repair.

Method: Introduce ORDebug (5k+ problems, 9 error types; iterative repairs trigger solver re-run and IIS recomputation) and ORBias (2k newsvendor instances, 1k ID/1k OOD; measure deviation from closed-form policies). Evaluate 26 models on 12k+ samples; train with domain-specific RLVR; apply curriculum training for bias mitigation.

Result: Domain-specific RLVR improves an 8B model to 95.3% recovery vs 86.2% (gain 9.1%), 62.4% diagnostic accuracy vs 47.8% (gain 14.6%), and 2.25x fewer steps to resolution (1.7× faster). ORBias shows curriculum reduces ID→OOD bias drift by 9.6% and halves systematic bias from 20.0% to 10.4% (48% reduction).

Conclusion: Process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scaling alone, illustrating the value of iterative, feedback-driven benchmarks for OR-LMM collaboration.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

*Young Kyung Kim,Oded Schlesinger,Qiangqiang Wu,J. Matías Di Martino,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OATTA introduces a gradient-free recursive Bayesian test-time adaptation using a learned temporal transition prior and a likelihood-ratio gate to exploit temporal dynamics in streaming inputs, yielding consistent accuracy gains (up to 6.35%) across diverse modalities while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA methods treat test-time streams as independent samples, neglecting supervisory signals from temporal structure. Exploiting temporal dynamics can provide complementary information for adaptation under distribution shift.

Method: Formulate TTA as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task. Use a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine predictions. Introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) to revert to the base predictor when temporal evidence is weak or absent, ensuring safety in weakly structured streams. The module is lightweight and model-agnostic.

Result: Empirical evaluation across image classification, wearable/physiological signals, and language sentiment analysis shows universal applicability and consistent improvement over baselines, with accuracy gains up to 6.35%.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal dynamics provides a distinct, orthogonal signal to traditional order-agnostic TTA, and OATTA offers a low-overhead, plug-in module that enhances pre-trained models without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%.

### [208] [Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21021)
*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Conditional Denoising Model (CDM) to learn the geometry of the physical solution manifold via denoising; uses a time-independent fixed-point inference to project noisy states onto the equilibrium manifold; achieves higher data and parameter efficiency than physics-consistent baselines and acts as a strong implicit regularizer without using governing equations during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate modeling often trades data-fitting accuracy against physical consistency. Soft physics losses may fail to strictly enforce governing equations, and post-hoc corrections do not learn the underlying geometry. There is a need for a method that intrinsically learns the solution manifold and projects estimations onto it.

Method: CDM trains a conditional denoising network that restores clean states from noisy ones, thereby learning a vector field pointing toward the valid solution subspace. A time-independent formulation converts inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. The model is trained with a denoising objective and does not rely on explicit governing equations during training.

Result: Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines.

Conclusion: The denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer. Even without exposure to the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses, offering a robust geometry-learning approach for physics-consistent surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

### [209] [SIGMA-PPG: Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture for PPG Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21031)
*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Yang Jiao,Yi Pan,Xiao Hu,Manuela Ferrario*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative, priors-informed masked model for PPG (SIGMA-PPG) that uses prior-guided adversarial masking and vector-quantized semantic consistency to improve robustness and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals are inherently redundant and noisy; standard masked models yield trivial solutions; contrastive methods lack morphological precision. A model that incorporates statistical priors and preserves physiologic waveform structure is needed.

Method: SIGMA-PPG introduces a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism driven by a reinforcement-learning-based teacher that uses statistical priors to craft challenging learning paths and avoid overfitting to noise. It also enforces semantic consistency via vector quantization so physiologically identical waveforms map to shared codebook indices, increasing semantic density and reducing redundant features.

Result: Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data; achieves superior average performance relative to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG demonstrates stronger, more robust representations for PPG across diverse tasks, due to priors-informed masking and semantic codebook constraints; code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

### [210] [Predict-Project-Renoise: Sampling Diffusion Models under Hard Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21033)
*Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Gilles Louppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained diffusion sampling with Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) enforces hard constraints during generation, improving physical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based neural emulators may violate physical laws or observational constraints; a sampling-time mechanism to guarantee constraint satisfaction is needed for scientific applications.

Method: Define a constrained forward diffusion that only diffuses within the feasible constraint set, producing constrained marginals. Introduce Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR): an iterative sampler that denoises, projects onto the feasible set, and renois es to sample from constrained marginals.

Result: PPR reduces constraint violations by >10x across 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting, improves sample consistency, and better matches the true constrained distribution versus baselines.

Conclusion: A principled framework for hard-constraint enforcement in diffusion-based emulators, with PPR showing strong cross-domain effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

### [211] [Thinking in Frames: How Visual Context and Test-Time Scaling Empower Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21037)
*Chengzu Li,Zanyi Wang,Jiaang Li,Yi Xu,Han Zhou,Huanyu Zhang,Ruichuan An,Dengyang Jiang,Zhaochong An,Ivan Vulić,Serge Belongie,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Video-generation-based visual reasoning uses intermediate frames as reasoning steps, enabling strong zero-shot generalization in Maze Navigation and Tangram puzzles; visual context acts as explicit control, and longer generated videos at test time improve spatial-temporal planning in unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of vision-language models in fine-grained spatial understanding and planning by introducing an intermediate, controllable visual representation (video frames) that can bridge initial and solved states.

Method: Formulate visual reasoning as a video-generation process that outputs intermediate frames between the initial state and the solution. Evaluate in two regimes: (i) Maze Navigation (sequential discrete planning with low visual change) and (ii) Tangram Puzzle (continuous manipulation with high visual change). Assess zero-shot generalization, use of visual context for control, and test-time video-length scaling.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Robust zero-shot generalization across unseen data without task-specific fine-tuning; (2) Visual context (icons/shapes) provides explicit control, maintaining visual consistency and robust planning; (3) Visual test-time scaling; longer generated videos improve zero-shot generalization to complex spatial-temporal paths.

Conclusion: Video generation is a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning, not merely a media tool, capable of supporting planning in spatial-temporal tasks through intermediate reasoning frames.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

### [212] [Test-Time Adaptation for Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21048)
*Yiqiao Liao,Farinaz Koushanfar,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework for unsupervised NCO that warm-starts partially relaxed trained parameters to blend generalization and instance-specific optimization, achieving better solutions with minimal cost on MVC and Max Clique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between generalization-based solvers and instance-specific optimization in unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO); generalization models offer inductive bias but poor warm starts, while instance-specific models adapt well but miss learned structure and risk poor optima.

Method: TACO applies strategic warm-starting by partially relaxing trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation at test time. It is model-agnostic and can be applied to existing generalizable NCO solvers.

Result: Outperforms naïve fine-tuning of a trained generalizable model and from-scratch instance-specific optimization; achieves better solution quality with negligible additional computational cost. Demonstrated on canonical CO problems (Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique) with robustness across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic CO scenarios.

Conclusion: TACO provides a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO, delivering effective adaptation with low overhead and strong empirical performance across varied problem settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

*Seungki Hong,Kyeongwon Jeong,Taekwang Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Snowball is a digital, scalable Ising machine with all-to-all couplings that uses dual-mode MCMC spin selection and asynchronous updates to speed up convergence; achieves 8x time-to-solution improvement on FPGA-based benchmark relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three practical bottlenecks in Ising machines: restrictive hardware topologies requiring embedding, destabilizing naive parallel spin updates, and limited coupling precision that hinders mappings and solution quality.

Method: Design and implement Snowball: a fully digital, all-to-all coupled Ising machine with dual-mode MCMC spin selection (two probabilistic update modes) and asynchronous spin updates. Supports wide, configurable coupling precision. Implemented on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card for acceleration.

Result: Prototype demonstrates an 8× reduction in time-to-solution compared to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Conclusion: Digital, scalable, all-to-all Ising machines with advanced spin-selection and asynchronous updates can achieve substantial time-to-solution improvements, thanks to greater precision and better convergence. The approach shows promise for practical deployment in combinatorial optimization tasks.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

*Zhuoyan Li,Aditya Bansal,Jinzhao Li,Shishuang He,Zhuoran Lu,Mutian Zhang,Qin Liu,Yiwei Yang,Swati Jain,Ming Yin,Yunyao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoupled, human-in-the-loop framework where LLMs propose feature transformations and an explicit utility/uncertainty model guides selection, augmented by selective human feedback; improves performance and reduces cognitive load in tabular feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have been used as black-box optimizers for feature engineering, but their operation-utility estimates are poorly calibrated, causing wasted exploration. Introducing a principled selection mechanism and human-in-the-loop feedback aims to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) LLMs generate a diverse set of candidate feature transformation operations; (2) a utility/uncertainty model evaluates and selects among candidates for implementation; (3) selectively incorporate human expert preferences to refine selection, especially in early rounds; experimental evaluation on synthetic and real user studies across tabular datasets.

Result: Demonstrates improved feature engineering performance across various tabular datasets and reduces users’ cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

Conclusion: Decoupling proposal from selection and incorporating human preferences within a calibrated utility framework yields more effective feature transformations and more efficient human-LLM collaboration in tabular learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

### [215] [Signal from Structure: Exploiting Submodular Upper Bounds in Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21061)
*Alexandre Larouche,Audrey Durand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SUBo-GFN introduces submodular upper bounds to train Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), enabling much higher data efficiency by generating training samples for unseen compositional objects. It leverages optimism in uncertainty to bound rewards and demonstrates improved distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real submodular tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data efficiency and coverage of the reward landscape in GFlowNets when rewards exhibit submodular structure, enabling better exploration of the compositional space.

Method: Derive submodular upper bounds on unseen compositions and use them within an Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty framework to train a GFlowNet (SUBo-GFN). Analyze bounds’ probability and coverage, and empirically validate on synthetic and real submodular tasks, comparing data efficiency and sample quality against classical GFNs.

Result: SUBo-GFN achieves orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same reward-query budget, with strong distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on both synthetic and real submodular tasks.

Conclusion: Exploiting submodular structure via upper bounds and optimistic learning substantially improves GFlowNet data efficiency and performance for submodular objectives.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

### [216] [Textual Equilibrium Propagation for Deep Compound AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21064)
*Minghui Chen,Wenlong Deng,James Zou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEP (Textual Equilibrium Propagation) introduces a local learning paradigm for long-horizon LLM-based pipelines to avoid exploding/vanishing gradients from global text feedback. It uses a two-phase process (free phase with local critics reaching equilibrium, and nudged phase with bounded prompt edits) to align local prompt optimization with global goals, improving accuracy and efficiency as system depth increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global textual backpropagation methods suffer depth-scaling issues: textual gradients explode or vanish as the pipeline depth grows, making optimization inefficient and error-prone.

Method: TEP employs a two-phase local learning scheme. In the free phase, local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts to equilibrium. In the nudged phase, proximal prompt edits are applied with bounded intensity, using forward signaling of task-level objectives rather than backward gradient chains. This enables local optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without backpropagation through the entire pipeline.

Result: Empirically, TEP improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods (e.g., TextGrad) on long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use datasets, with gains that grow with depth while preserving black-box LLM practicality.

Conclusion: TEP provides a scalable, depth-friendly alternative to global textual backpropagation, mitigating gradient-related issues and reducing computation, thereby enabling deeper, more capable compound AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey on OOD generalization in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), organizing approaches by fixed-task vs heterogeneous-task generalization, and outlining evaluation protocols and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphs are central to many domains, but graph learning models struggle to generalize under distribution shifts caused by changes in structure, semantics, modalities, or task formulations. GFMs trained on diverse graphs aim to provide robust, general representations.

Method: Review and synthesize recent GFMs literature with a unified OOD problem setting, categorize methods by their support for fixed-task and cross-task generalization, summarize OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives, and discuss evaluation protocols and future directions.

Result: The paper claims to be the first survey specifically addressing OOD generalization in GFMs, consolidating current approaches and their OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives.

Conclusion: Provides a structured overview of challenges, taxonomies of methods, evaluation practices, and open research directions for fostering OOD robustness in GFMs.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

*Shivam Patel,William Cocke,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOCUS creates low-dimensional, geometry-aware embeddings of LLMs by an attention-based forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores, enabling new model onboarding and robust routing without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manage and harness a large, dynamic pool of LLMs by compactly representing each model’s capabilities so that routing, comparison, and selection can occur efficiently and without retraining.

Method: An attention-based encoder generates deterministic embeddings from query encodings and per-model evaluation scores; a correctness predictor uses embeddings plus query encodings to improve routing on unseen queries; no retraining of models is required when adding new models to the pool.

Result:  LOCUS achieves up to 4.8x fewer query evaluations to produce informative embeddings; the embedding space is geometrically meaningful with proximity reflecting model similarity, enabling clustering, model comparison, portfolio selection, and proxies for unavailable models.

Conclusion: LOCUS provides an efficient, model-agnostic embedding framework for large model pools that supports scalable onboarding, accurate routing for unseen queries, and versatile downstream tasks without retraining existing models.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MapPFN is a prior-data fitted network pretrained on synthetic, causal perturbation data and used with in-context learning to predict perturbation effects in unseen biological contexts without gradient updates, matching performance of models trained on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create treatment-effect estimators that adapt to unseen biological contexts by leveraging interventional evidence at inference time, addressing the limitation that current methods cannot generalize beyond their training data.

Method: Pretrain a PFN on synthetic perturbation data generated from a prior over causal perturbations (in silico gene knockouts). At inference, given a set of experiments, use in-context learning to map observed experiments to post-perturbation distributions without gradient-based optimization.

Result: MapPFN can identify differentially expressed genes and achieves performance comparable to models trained on real single-cell data, despite being trained only on simulated knockouts.

Conclusion: Pretraining on synthetic causal perturbations enables a context-adaptive perturbation estimator that leverages in-context learning at inference time, reducing the need for retraining with real data while remaining competitive with models trained on real data.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data.

*Minjae Kwon,Josephine Lamp,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safe RL policies often fail under distribution shift in a diabetes management setting; test-time shielding with learned dynamics models restores safety and yields 13–14% Time-in-Range gains for strong baselines, across eight algorithms and multiple patient groups. Provides GlucoSim benchmark and code for studying safety under shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between training-time safety guarantees and deployment under distribution shift in safety-critical control. Diabetes management is a safety-critical testbed for RL; need mechanisms to preserve safety across diverse patients.

Method: Evaluate eight safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator (GlucoSim) to identify a safety generalization gap. Propose test-time shielding that filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models. Assess across three diabetes types and three age groups. Metrics include Time-in-Range, clinical risk index, and glucose variability.

Result: Found a safety generalization gap: training-time constraints are often violated on unseen patients. Test-time shielding recovers safety across algorithms and populations. Time-in-Range gains of 13–14% achieved for PPO-Lag and CPO; reductions in clinical risk index and glucose variability. Benchmarked across eight algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups.

Conclusion: The proposed shielding approach is effective across diverse safe-RL methods and patient populations, suggesting a robust path to safe deployment under distribution shift. The GlucoSim platform provides a public benchmark to study safety under shift in safety-critical control; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

### [221] [TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135)
*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TRACE for continuous transitions between causal mechanisms, modeling transitions as convex mixtures of atomic mechanisms; demonstrates identifiability and superior trajectory recovery (up to 0.99 correlation) over discrete-switching baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often evolve smoothly rather than switching abruptly between discrete causal regimes; existing methods fail to capture gradual transitions and jointly identifying latent variables and their mixing trajectory.

Method: Formulates transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms with time-varying mixing coefficients. Introduces TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts where each expert learns an atomic mechanism; during training, and at test time, it recovers the continuous mechanism trajectory, including intermediate states unseen during training.

Result: Theoretically, latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are identifiable. Empirically, TRACE recovers mechanism trajectories with high fidelity (up to 0.99 correlation) on synthetic and real data, outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enables joint identifiability and practical recovery of continuous mechanism transitions in temporal causal representations, generalizing to intermediate states and improving robustness beyond discrete-switching models.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

*Kevin Han,Haolin Cong,Bowen Deng,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic cutoff for MLIPs induces sparsity by limiting per-atom neighbors, enabling substantial memory and speed gains with minimal accuracy loss across 4 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the bottlenecks of MLIP inference time and memory consumption by relaxing the fixed cutoff, enabling scalable molecular dynamics with accurate potentials.

Method: Introduce a dynamic cutoff per atom to enforce a target number of neighbors, producing a sparser atom graph. Apply this approach to four state-of-the-art MLIPs (MACE, Nequip, OrbV3, TensorNet) and evaluate on materials and molecular datasets.

Result: Achieves ~2.26x reduction in memory and ~2.04x faster inference, with minimal accuracy drop compared to fixed-cutoff models across tested systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic cutoff is a viable route for scalable MLIP-based MD, preserving accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains; open-source implementations included.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

### [223] [Mobility-Embedded POIs: Learning What A Place Is and How It Is Used from Human Movement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21149)
*Maria Despoina Siampou,Shushman Choudhury,Shang-Ling Hsu,Neha Arora,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ME-POIs fuse mobility-derived usage signals with text-based POI embeddings via temporally contextualized visits and contrastive alignment, plus a cross-scale propagation to alleviate long-tail sparsity; yields superior POI representations across five map-enrichment tasks, showing POI function is crucial for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current POI representations rely on static textual metadata (identity) or trajectory context (movement patterns) but largely ignore function—how places are actually used. Function is a missing, essential signal for robust, general representations of POIs in real-world contexts.

Method: 1) Start from language-model-derived POI embeddings (identity). 2) Integrate large-scale human mobility data. 3) Encode each visit as temporally contextualized embeddings. 4) Use contrastive learning to align visit embeddings with learnable POI representations, capturing cross-user and temporal usage patterns. 5) Address long-tail sparsity by propagating temporal visit patterns from nearby frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales.

Result: ME-POIs augmented embeddings consistently outperform text-only and mobility-only baselines across five proposed map enrichment tasks. Notably, mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on some tasks, highlighting the importance of POI function in representations.

Conclusion: Incorporating POI function through mobility-augmented, temporally contextualized embeddings yields more accurate and generalizable POI representations, suggesting future work should integrate usage signals with identity signals for richer map understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

### [224] [Can Neural Networks Learn Small Algebraic Worlds? An Investigation Into the Group-theoretic Structures Learned By Narrow Models Trained To Predict Group Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21150)
*Henry Kvinge,Andrew Aguilar,Nayda Farnsworth,Grace O'Brien,Robert Jasper,Sarah Scullen,Helen Jenne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks trained to perform a fixed group operation can learn latent, reusable algebraic structure; some properties emerge in representations, enabling simple classifiers to detect subgroups, but fundamental notions like the identity element may remain elusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond AI-era answer-extraction in mathematics and assess whether narrow ML models trained on a specific algebraic task acquire broader mathematical structure that a researcher or another AI could extract.

Method: Train neural networks to predict group operations (e.g., modular arithmetic, composition of permutations) and evaluate their internal representations. Use a suite of tests targeting group-theoretic concepts (identity, commutativity, subgroups). Attempt to extract abstract properties via linear probes/classifiers without explicit labels for the abstract concepts.

Result: Models develop representations that encode some algebraic properties, including hints of commutativity in modular arithmetic. Linear classifiers can reliably distinguish elements of certain subgroups despite no subgroup labels in the data. However, the concept of the identity element is not extractable from the representations in these experiments.

Conclusion: Even small neural networks can distill nontrivial abstract structure from new mathematical objects, suggesting a pathway to using ML to assist mathematical discovery, though some fundamental notions may remain inaccessible to current linear probing approaches.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

### [225] [Learning to Advect: A Neural Semi-Lagrangian Architecture for Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21151)
*Carlos A. Pereira,Stéphane Gaudreault,Valentin Dallerit,Christopher Subich,Shoyon Panday,Siqi Wei,Sasa Zhang,Siddharth Rout,Eldad Haber,Raymond J. Spiteri,David Millard,Emilia Diaconescu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARADIS introduces a physics-inspired decomposition of weather dynamics into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks operating on latent variables. Advection is implemented via Neural Semi-Lagrangian transport on the sphere with differentiable interpolation; diffusion is modeled by depthwise-separable spatial mixing; local sources and vertical interactions are captured by pointwise channel interactions. The architecture achieves state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost on ERA5 benchmarks, matching or exceeding 0.25-degree baselines such as ECMWF HRES and GraphCast with a 1-degree model trained in under a GPU month.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of monolithic neural weather models in handling long-range advection and other physical processes by introducing inductive biases through a modular, physics-inspired decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction components to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Decompose latent state into three blocks: (1) advection via Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator on the sphere with differentiable trajectory interpolation; (2) diffusion-like processes via depthwise-separable spatial mixing; (3) local source terms and vertical interactions via pointwise channel interactions. End-to-end training on ERA5-based benchmarks using a 1-degree grid; compare against traditional and ML baselines including ECMWF HRES and GraphCast; training cost reported as under one GPU-month.

Result: The PARADIS model delivers state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost, achieving performance that meets or exceeds 0.25-degree baselines such as ECMWF HRES and GraphCast on ERA5 benchmarks with a 1-degree configuration.

Conclusion: A modular, physics-inspired architecture with explicit advection, diffusion, and reaction components can deliver competitive weather forecasting performance at lower training costs, validating the value of embedding physical inductive biases in neural weather models.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

### [226] [A Federated Generalized Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Mixture Models with an Unknown Number of Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21160)
*Michael Ibrahim,Nagi Gebraeel,Weijun Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGEM introduces a federated EM-based clustering method for unknown K across clients with heterogeneous local cluster sets; it uses uncertainty sets around local component maximizers to infer overlaps and the global number of clusters, with convergence guarantees and isotropic-GMM specialization for efficiency; empirically competitive with centralized EM and superior to existing federated clustering baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering under a federated setting where the global number of clusters K is unknown and local data exhibit heterogeneous, potentially overlapping cluster structures. The goal is a privacy-preserving, distributed algorithm with principled inference of global components.

Method: Each client runs local EM to estimate local components, constructs an uncertainty set around each local maximizer, and the server aggregates these to learn overlaps between clients and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. The isotropic GMM setting is analyzed to derive tractable per-iteration computations.

Result: The approach comes with probabilistic convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. For isotropic GMMs, the method yields low-complexity, scalable updates. Numerical experiments show FedGEM achieves performance comparable to centralized EM and outperforms existing federated clustering methods.

Conclusion: FedGEM provides a principled framework for federated clustering with an unknown global K, enabling convergence guarantees and practical efficiency, particularly under isotropic GMMs, while showing competitive empirical performance against both centralized and federated baselines.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

### [227] [Efficient Simple Regret Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21167)
*Shuai Liu,Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Botao Hao,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First simple-regret guarantees for stochastic contextual logistic bandits; achieves near-optimal rates in dimension d and horizon T with leading term independent of κ; introduces tractable deterministic and randomized algorithms (Thompson Sampling variants) and validates empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend simple-regret guarantees from linear to logistic contextual bandits, remove dependence on a condition-number-like κ, and provide practical, tractable algorithms with empirical validation.

Method: Leverage ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis to design algorithms for logistic bandits; derive simple-regret bounds tilde O(d/√T); introduce a Thompson Sampling variant achieving tilde O(d^{3/2}/√T); extend to logistic setting with same rates; analyze tractability for finite action sets; provide randomized vs deterministic variants.

Result: Simple regret bounds tilde O(d/√T) with leading term independent of κ; randomized Thompson Sampling achieves tilde O(d^{3/2}/√T); extension to logistic case preserves rates and κ-independence; finite-action tractable; experiments corroborate theory.

Conclusion: Presents the first simple-regret guarantees for stochastic contextual logistic bandits, with practical, lower-cost randomized algorithms, and empirical validation; results bridge the gap between linear models and logistic contexts in the simple-regret regime.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

*Fernando Palafox,Jingqi Li,Jesse Milzman,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unifying, model-agnostic framework for information-gathering costs in active learning of unknown dynamical systems, based on Massey’s directed information; shows mutual information is a special case and links it to linearized Bayesian information gain; validated on linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active information gathering aims to accelerate learning of system dynamics, but existing approaches embed bespoke costs tied to specific models and planners. A general, decoupled cost is desirable to compare methods fairly and understand fundamental information requirements.

Method: Develop a general information-gathering cost using Massey’s directed information that relies only on Markov dynamics with additive noise. Explicitly expose causal dependencies among parameters, beliefs, and controls to decouple design choices (dynamics model, belief update, observation model, planner). Demonstrate that mutual information costs from prior work are a special case within this framework and derive a connection to information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation.

Result: The framework subsumes existing mutual-information-based costs as a special case, provides theoretical justification for MI-based active learning through a link to Bayesian information gain, and demonstrates practical utility with experiments across linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent dynamical systems.

Conclusion: A universal, model-agnostic cost for information gathering is established, enabling principled comparisons of active learning strategies. It clarifies when MI-based criteria align with true information gain and supports broader applicability across diverse dynamical settings.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

*Augusto Santos,Teresa Santos,Catarina Rodrigues,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a representation-learning pipeline for early detection of emergent phenomena by tuning a one-parameter family of estimators (powers of covariance/precision) and classifying the learned features, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on seizures and churn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent phenomena in complex systems stem from hidden causal interactions. Detecting them early requires uncovering latent structure when the data-generating process is unknown and partially observed, enabling interpretable and predictive insights.

Method: Learn an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators based on powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix, then use a supervised classifier on this representation. The authors establish structural consistency for the estimator family.

Result: Empirical validation shows competitive performance on seizure detection and churn prediction. The optimal covariance power also exhibits identifiability and captures structural signatures, aligning predictive accuracy with interpretable structure.

Conclusion: The framework integrates prediction and explainability, revealing how to tune into underlying causal structure driving critical events and providing a principled, interpretable approach suitable for early-warning tasks.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC2L-GAD: Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning for graph anomaly detection; combines information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual augmentation to produce anomaly-preserving positives and hard negatives; reduces computation ~65% while maintaining detection quality; strong results on nine benchmarks including GADBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address label scarcity and severe class imbalance in graph anomaly detection; fix two limitations of graph contrastive learning: semantic inconsistency from random augmentations and trivial negatives from naive sampling; leverage counterfactual reasoning to generate informative positives/negatives.

Method: Use active information-theoretic node selection to identify structurally complex nodes; generate counterfactual augmentations that preserve anomalies; create anomaly-preserving positives and hard normals; limit counterfactual generation to a strategically chosen subset to save cost.

Result: Cost reduced ~65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation; detection quality preserved; competitive or superior to SOTA baselines on nine datasets; notable gains on anomalies with complex attribute-structure interactions (e.g., GADBench real-world financial graphs).

Conclusion: AC2L-GAD demonstrates effective, scalable graph anomaly detection via principled counterfactual reasoning, offering a practical solution for label-scarce, imbalanced graph settings.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

TL;DR: A novel EA foundation model with parallel encoding guided by seed pairs, combining local anchor-aware propagation and a merged relation graph with a learnable matcher to boost cross-graph alignment and unseen KG generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EA models suffer from limited transferability; adapting GFMs to EA is impeded by a reasoning horizon gap due to long-range dependencies in sparse, heterogeneous KGs; the approach seeks to leverage local anchors and global structure to enable scalable, zero-shot alignment.

Method: Two parallel encoding streams initialized from seed EA pairs; anchor-conditioned message passing; merged relation graph to capture global dependencies; learnable interaction module for matching; inference is shortened by local proximity guidance; evaluated on unseen KGs.

Result: Experiments show strong generalizability to unseen KGs and superior performance over baselines, validating the proposed EA foundation model.

Conclusion: The parallel-encoding EA foundation model effectively mitigates the reasoning horizon gap, achieving transferable alignment across unseen KGs and offering a scalable framework for EA in conjunction with graph foundation models.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) provides post-hoc, deterministic bias correction for diffusion/flow models, preserving sampling trajectories while improving fidelity and coverage; achieves state-of-the-art MNIST FID with 1-NFE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality in high dimensions; want effective bias correction without noise injection or multi-step resampling, via post-hoc refinements.

Method: Two refinement stages: (1) latent-space alignment for approximately invertible generators, (2) data-space refinement with lightweight augmentations; corrections are deterministic and keep the original ODE trajectory, avoiding perturbations to sampling dynamics; no additional noise or resampling required.

Result: Consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FFHQ-256; MNIST FID improves from 3.95 to 1.46 with 1-NFE; maintains sample diversity.

Conclusion: BFR offers an efficient, effective bias correction framework compatible with flow/diffusion models, enabling strong performance with minimal extra computation; potential broader applicability; (limitations not detailed in abstract).

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cross-subject SSVEP-BCI framework that combines Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA), Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) with adversarial pre-training and dual-ensemble pseudo-label refinement, plus Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL); achieves state-of-the-art results across Benchmark and BETA datasets, robust to varying signal lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP-based BCIs suffer from strong inter-subject variability and high annotation costs, limiting generalization. Cross-subject domain adaptation with self-training and contrastive learning can improve transferability with fewer labels.

Method: FBEA exploits frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. CSST comprises PTAL (adversarial alignment of source and target distributions) and DEST (refined pseudo-labels via dual ensembles). TFA-CL enhances feature discriminability across multiple augmented time–frequency views.

Result: Extensive experiments on Benchmark and BETA datasets show state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: The integration of FBEA, CSST, and TFA-CL effectively mitigates cross-subject variability and labeling demands in SSVEP-BCIs, achieving superior generalization and potential applicability to related EEG-based BCIs.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the underexplored issue of how GDL/TDL features diffuse and align during training on graphs, proposing a formal topological framework to model local feature agreements via cellular sheaves.

Method: Develops a cellular sheaf theoretic model on graphs (nodes/edges) to encode feature data and edge weights; defines measures of local alignment/harmonicity; tracks feature diffusion and aggregation; introduces a multiscale extension inspired by TDA to capture hierarchical interactions across scales.

Result: Provides a topological characterization of GDL/TDL architectures and their learned signals; yields qualitative insights for tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection; sets up a framework for future empirical and theoretical studies on training dynamics.

Conclusion: A topological data analysis-inspired, sheaf-theoretic framework to study feature diffusion in graph-based deep learning, enabling joint geometric/topological analyses of architectures and learned signals and guiding future research.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

### [235] [Temporal Context and Architecture: A Benchmark for Naturalistic EEG Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21215)
*Mehmet Ergezer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Long-context EEG decoding yields higher accuracy across architectures; S5 achieves peak accuracy with ~20x fewer parameters than CNN, but trade-offs in robustness (over-confident OOD errors) versus EEGXF's conservative uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding and how different architectures fare under robustness challenges (OOD inputs, cross-frequency shifts, cross-subject generalization).

Method: Benchmark five architectures (CNN, LSTM, stabilized EEG Transformer EEGXF, S4, S5) on a 4-class decoding task using the HBN movie-watching dataset. Vary segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization.

Result: Longer context improves accuracy; at 64s, S5 ≈ 98.7%±0.6, CNN ≈ 98.3%±0.3. S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. S5 shows stronger cross-subject accuracy but more over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts but less calibrated in-distribution.

Conclusion: There is a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 is attractive for parameter-efficient peak accuracy, while EEGXF is preferable when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

### [236] [Soft Quantization: Model Compression Via Weight Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21219)
*Daniel T. Bernstein,Luca Di Carlo,David Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing short-range attractive couplings during training yields a soft, mixed-precision weight quantization that outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, using only two extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient model compression by inducing fast discretization of weight distributions through training-time couplings; provide a tool to study the compression-generalization trade-off in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Method: Add short-range attractive couplings between weights during training to rapidly discretize the weight distribution and define a soft quantization objective with two new hyperparameters; compare against histogram-equalized PTQ on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10.

Result: Soft quantization achieves favorable accuracy/compression trade-offs compared to histogram-equalized PTQ and supports a mixed-precision compression regime with only two additional hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Training-time weight couplings offer a viable path to soft, mixed-precision quantization and enable a new framework for examining the compression-generalization trade-off in deep networks.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based trajectory forecaster (PHDME) that uses a GP-dPHS prior to enable physics-informed learning under sparse observations and incomplete physics, culminating in an amortized sampler with split conformal uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecast dynamical systems under data scarcity and partial physical knowledge; enforce physical structure without full governing equations.

Method: 1) Learn energy-based port-Hamiltonian system via Gaussian process distributed PHS (GP-dPHS) from limited data. 2) Use GP-dPHS to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training. 3) Include a physics residual loss guided by the PHS. 4) Train diffusion model as amortized sampler/forecaster. 5) Apply split conformal calibration to quantify uncertainty.

Result: Improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system; provides uncertainty statements.

Conclusion: PHDME integrates port-Hamiltonian priors with diffusion models in a data-scarce regime, enabling reliable forecasting with calibrated uncertainty; particularly suited for complex, nonlinear dynamics with incomplete equations.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

*Luwei Sun,Dongrui Shen,Jianfe Li,Yulong Zhao,Han Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theory to approximate ratio-type density functionals f1/f2, where f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginals, within diffusion-based generative models, using SignReLU neural networks to derive L^p approximation bounds and rates; specialized to DDPMs to bound excess KL risk and decompose it into approximation and estimation errors, yielding finite-sample generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional generative modeling often requires modeling a conditional density as a ratio f1/f2. This ratio-structured objective in a diffusion-model context lacks rigorous approximation theory and finite-sample guarantees. The work aims to establish a neural-approximation framework with SignReLU activations to handle the piecewise-linear structure of the ratio functionals and provide generalization bounds.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for approximating ratio-type functionals with deep nets using SignReLU activations that exploit piecewise structure; prove L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates under standard regularity assumptions. Specialize to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by constructing a SignReLU-based estimator for the reverse process and deriving upper bounds on the excess KL risk between generated and true distributions, decomposed into approximation and estimation errors.

Result: Establishes L^p approximation bounds and convergence rates for ratio-type functionals with SignReLU nets; provides a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the DDPM reverse process; derives excess KL risk bounds and decomposes them into approximation and estimation errors, yielding finite-sample generalization guarantees for diffusion-based generative models.

Conclusion: The work links ratio-type density functionals to neural estimation in diffusion models, delivering concrete approximation guarantees and finite-sample generalization results via SignReLU networks, thereby informing theory and practice of diffusion-based generative modeling.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

*Yiju Guo,Tianyi Hu,Zexu Sun,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LENS introduces token-level interference removal to RLVR, purifying prompts to improve rollout efficiency and then transferring successes to train on noisy prompts; achieves faster convergence and higher performance than GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address exploration inefficiency in RLVR under limited rollout budgets by identifying non-difficulty-related failures caused by interference tokens in prompts.

Method: Purify prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens, then use successful rollouts from this purification to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling learning to ignore interference in realistic prompting settings.

Result: LENS outperforms GRPO with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6x speedup in experiments.

Conclusion: Pruning interference tokens is a critical driver of rollout efficiency in RLVR and suggests a new research direction focusing on prompt-level interference mitigation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

### [240] [Conditional Generative Framework with Peak-Aware Attention for Robust Chemical Detection under Interferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21246)
*Namkyung Yoon,Sanghong Kim,Hwangnam Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Peak-aware CGAN generates conditioned GC-MS signals to augment data for AI-based discrimination under interference, achieving high similarity to real spectra and fewer false alarms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GC-MS reliability degrades with interfering substances causing nonspecific peaks, drift, and noise. Limited experimental data hampers robust AI discrimination.

Method: Introduce a peak-aware mechanism to emphasize characteristic GC-MS peaks; encode chemical/solvent information into a latent vector; train a conditional GAN to generate spectra matching experimental conditions and simulated indirect substance scenarios; evaluate with synthetic and real-like datasets.

Result: Generated spectra achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation >0.9 with target signals, preserve peak diversity, and reduce discrimination false alarms.

Conclusion: The peak-aware CGAN framework can improve GC-MS reliability under interference by producing realistic conditioned spectra for AI discrimination, potentially reducing the need for extensive real experiments.

Abstract: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EGAM extends GAM by updating both node and edge embeddings via multi-head dot-product attention, using an autoregressive encoder–decoder trained with policy-gradient RL and a designed baseline; it matches or surpasses existing NCO methods on routing tasks, with strong performance on highly constrained problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAM only aggregates node features, potentially underutilizing edge information and struggling with highly constrained routing graphs. A more expressive attention mechanism and edge-aware representations could improve performance without labeled data.

Method: Propose Extended Graph Attention Model (EGAM) that updates node and edge embeddings with multi-head dot-product attention; uses autoregressive encoder–decoder architecture; trained with policy-gradient reinforcement learning using a specially designed baseline.

Result: EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems; shows exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, demonstrating robustness on complex graph structures.

Conclusion: EGAM effectively extends GAM to edge-aware, more expressive routing solvers, offering strong performance without labeled data and handling difficult constraint regimes better than prior GAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

*Yisheng Zhong,Zhengbang Yang,Zhuangdi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUET uses distillation from a prompt-steered teacher to train a student that forgets undesirable knowledge while preserving general knowledge, yielding strong forgetting with high utility and far better data-efficiency than prior unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remove undesirable knowledge from LLMs without retraining from scratch, addressing computational cost and catastrophic forgetting of tuning-based methods, and vulnerability of in-context unlearning to prompt manipulation.

Method: Train a student model to imitate a prompt-steered teacher that refuses undesirable knowledge, via distillation, to preserve general knowledge while erasing undesired content.

Result: On benchmarks with enriched evaluation protocols, DUET achieves better forgetting and utility preservation and is orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Conclusion: DUET presents a practical, data-efficient distillation-based unlearning paradigm that blends the strengths of tuning-free and in-context approaches, improving trustworthy AI by removing unwanted knowledge while preserving general capabilities.

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD) fuses diffusion models with first-principles constraints by adding Laplace-based residual supervision and multi-layer physical conditioning, yielding physics-consistent generation with improved accuracy and generalization across ODEs, PDEs, and algebraic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable physics-compliant generative modeling by integrating explicit physical constraints into diffusion-based learning, addressing the purely data-driven limitation in engineering and scientific problems.

Method: Use a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise training; a conditional embedding module injects physical information into the denoising network at multiple diffusion steps, making guidance consistent throughout the process.

Result: Extensive experiments on vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow, and plasma dynamics show PILD improves accuracy, stability, and generalization versus existing physics-informed and diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: PILD offers a concise, modular framework broadly applicable to problems governed by ODEs, PDEs, and algebraic/inequality constraints, effectively enforcing physics during diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools for modeling complex data distributions, yet their purely data-driven nature limits applicability in practical engineering and scientific problems where physical laws need to be followed. This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zenith is a scalable, efficient ranking architecture for recommender systems that captures multi-granularity feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead, leveraging Token Fusion and Token Boost to scale high-dimensional Prime Tokens; deployed to TikTok Live and yields modest CTR AUC gains and notable engagement improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to model complex feature interactions while scaling model capacity without incurring high inference latency; prior work underexplored efficient token-level handling.

Method: Zenith uses few high-dimensional Prime Tokens and introduces Token Fusion and Token Boost modules to increase token heterogeneity and balance computational efficiency; designed for scalability in live recommender scenarios.

Result: In an online A/B test on TikTok Live, Zenith achieved +1.05% CTR AUC and -1.10% Logloss; and approximately +9.93% improvements in Quality Watch Session per user and +8.11% in Quality Watch duration per user.

Conclusion: Zenith demonstrates a practical, scalable approach to feature interaction modeling that improves ranking performance and user-engagement metrics with low runtime overhead.

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

### [245] [TimeSliver : Symbolic-Linear Decomposition for Explainable Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21289)
*Akash Pandey,Payal Mohapatra,Wei Chen,Qi Zhu,Sinan Keten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeSliver combines raw time-series data with a symbolic abstraction to create a representation where each temporal segment linearly contributes to the final prediction, enabling faithful, segment-level attribution. It outperforms gradient/attention-based attribution methods and maintains predictive accuracy close to state-of-the-art across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate the need for faithful, comprehensive temporal attribution in time-series classification by addressing limitations of post-hoc gradient/feature-based attributions (reference-state sensitivity, poor cross-dataset generalization) and the questionable faithfulness of attention-based temporal attribution.

Method: Introduce TimeSliver, a deep learning framework that jointly encodes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction into a representation where each element linearly encodes a temporal segment's contribution to the prediction, yielding per-time-point importance scores; evaluate on 7 synthetic/real-world multivariate datasets for attribution performance and on 26 UEA benchmarks for predictive performance.

Result: TimeSliver achieves an 11% improvement over other temporal attribution methods on 7 datasets and attains predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmarks.

Conclusion: TimeSliver provides a strong, explainable framework for general time-series classification that preserves temporal structure and delivers faithful, segment-level attribution without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

*Changyu Li,Dingcheng Huang,Kexuan Yao,Xiaoya Ni,Lijuan Shen,Fei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PG-TMT: a physics-guided tri-branch transformer for reliable prognostics in rotating machinery; combines physics-aligned representations, EVT-calibrated decision rules, and hysteresis for calibrated, interpretable early warnings; shows improvements in precision-recall under imbalance and cross-domain transfer with leakage-free streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable early warning signals under nonstationary operation, domain shifts, and severe class imbalance while keeping false alarms low; existing methods often lack physics grounding or calibrated decision rules for deployment.

Method: Tri-branch encoder: (1) depthwise-separable conv stem for micro-transients, (2) Tiny-Mamba state-space branch for near-linear long-range dynamics, (3) lightweight local Transformer for cross-channel resonances; analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping tying attention to fault-order bands with a band-alignment score; EVT-based healthy-score exceedances with on-threshold false-alarm control and dual-threshold hysteresis; leakage-free streaming with right-censoring for datasets (CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY) and an industrial pilot; evaluation on precision-recall AUC, ROC AUC, mean time-to-detect, cross-domain transfer.

Result: PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC under imbalance, competitive or better ROC AUC, shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, and strong cross-domain transfer; provides calibrated, interpretable early warnings.

Conclusion: Physics-aligned representations combined with EVT-calibrated decision rules yield deployment-ready, interpretable PHM warnings with calibrated false-alarm control and robust cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

*Anders Gjølbye,Ida Kargaard,Emma Kargaard,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLS-SVD under random entrywise missing data in a high-dimensional spiked setting: masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix with signal attenuated by sqrt(rho); a BBP-type phase transition dictates when the top singular vectors recover latent directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlaps; validation via simulations and semi-synthetic experiments across aspect ratios, signal strength, and missingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify the recoverability and theoretical limits of PLS-SVD when data are incomplete, providing a precise phase diagram and overlap formulas.

Method: Model as a proportional high-dimensional spiked model with independent, entrywise missing-at-random masking. Normalize the masked cross-covariance and treat it as a spiked rectangular random matrix with effective signal scaled by sqrt(rho). Derive BBP-type phase transition and closed-form asymptotic overlaps; validate with simulations and semi-synthetic experiments across aspect ratios and missingness levels.

Result: Masked signal strength is attenuated by sqrt(rho); a sharp BBP-type phase transition governs recoverability: below threshold, leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative; above threshold, they align with latent directions with computable asymptotic overlaps. Simulations and semi-synthetic experiments corroborate the phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness.

Conclusion: The work characterizes PLS-SVD performance under missing data, linking detectability to rho and aspect ratio, and providing theoretical benchmarks and practical guidance for incomplete multimodal data; it also prompts extensions to non-MCAR missingness and finite-sample analyses.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

Motivation: Address the theoretical gap in dataset distillation by formalizing optimal distillation around information capture (informativeness) and sample effectiveness (utility).

Method: Two components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples; (2) utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm; integrated into a distillation framework to balance informativeness and utility.

Result: Empirical results show a 6.1 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18, indicating strong performance gains. 

Conclusion: Presents a principled framework that connects information-theoretic notions with practical sample selection for dataset distillation, offering improved performance and a path toward architecture-aware distillation; scalability and approximation of Shapley Values may be practical considerations.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

### [249] [Achieving $\varepsilon^{-2}$ Dependence for Average-Reward Q-Learning with a New Contraction Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21301)
*Zijun Chen,Zaiwei Chen,Nian Si,Shengbo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimal sample complexity tilde-O(epsilon^-2) for synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning in average-reward MDPs via lazy dynamics and an instance-dependent seminorm that induces one-step contraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of contraction in average-reward MDPs and limitations of existing analyses that rely on strong contraction or discounting/episodic reductions; obtain non-asymptotic, near-optimal learning guarantees under practical assumptions.

Method: Introduce lazified dynamics (state-stay probability) and construct an instance-dependent seminorm. Prove that the lazified Bellman operator is a one-step contraction under this seminorm and analyze both synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning.

Result: Establishes optimal tilde-O(epsilon^-2) sample complexity (up to log factors) for learning under the lazy dynamics, matching lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The approach shows that contractivity can be recovered via a data-dependent seminorm under lazy dynamics, enabling optimal non-asymptotic learning rates for average-reward MDPs without requiring strong prior assumptions or discounting/episodic reductions.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

*Wei-Di Chang,Mikael Henaff,Brandon Amos,Gregory Dudek,Scott Fujimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Search in model-based RL is not a plug-and-play substitute for learned policies; mitigating distribution shift during planning is more crucial than model or value accuracy, enabling state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the standard view that long-horizon predictions and compounding errors are the main obstacles to model-based RL; investigate the actual bottleneck and the conditions under which search helps or hurts.

Method: Empirical analysis of search-based planning in model-based RL across multiple benchmarks, with ablations to identify techniques that mitigate distribution shift and enable effective search.

Result: Contrary to common belief, search can harm performance even with highly accurate models; improving distribution shift mitigation yields state-of-the-art results; the authors also identify key techniques for enabling effective search.

Conclusion: Mitigating distribution shift is more important than maximizing model or value function accuracy; leveraging proper techniques to control shift allows search to be beneficial, redefining the role of planning in model-based RL.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

### [251] [Transferable Graph Condensation from the Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21309)
*Huaming Du,Yijie Huang,Su Yao,Yiying Wang,Yueyang Zhou,Jingwen Yang,Jinshi Zhang,Han Ji,Yu Zhao,Guisong Liu,Hegui Zhang,Carl Yang,Gang Kou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TGCC is a transferable graph dataset condensation method that uses causal-invariant features to enable cross-task and cross-domain transfer, via spatial-domain causal interventions, enhanced condensation, and spectral-domain contrastive learning; it reports up to 13.41% gains in cross-task/domain scenarios and state-of-the-art on most single-task datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph dataset condensation methods assume downstream tasks align with the original dataset and task, which limits cross-task/cross-domain transfer. Preserving domain-invariant, causally relevant knowledge could enable condensed datasets to generalize across tasks and domains.

Method: 1) Extract domain causal-invariant features from the graph's spatial domain via causal interventions. 2) Perform enhanced condensation to capture both structural and feature information. 3) Use spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning to inject causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, preserving original causal information.

Result: Experimental evaluation on five public datasets and a novel FinReport dataset shows TGCC achieving up to 13.41% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios, and attaining state-of-the-art performance on 5 of 6 datasets in the single-dataset, single-task setting.

Conclusion: TGCC provides effective and transferable condensed graphs that retain causal information, enabling robust cross-task and cross-domain transfer while remaining competitive in standard single-task scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

*Xiaozhuang Li,Xindi Tang,Fang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-reinforcement learning framework called GAT-PEARL combines a graph attention network (GAT) with PEARL to enable rapid adaptation of autonomous electric taxi fleet policies to dynamic charging network layouts, improving generalization and efficiency in Chengdu data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the mismatch between static charging-network assumptions in many RL studies and the real-world dynamic, uncertain charging availability. Seeks rapid adaptation to changing infrastructure without retraining.

Method: Integrates GAT for robust spatial representations of infrastructure layouts, capturing spatiotemporal relations; uses PEARL-like probabilistic embeddings to enable quick inferrence-based adaptation in actor-critic RL, forming a meta-RL framework that adapts to different charging network layouts without retraining.

Result: In simulations with real Chengdu data, GAT-PEARL outperforms conventional RL baselines, generalizes to unseen infrastructure layouts, and achieves higher overall operational efficiency under dynamic charging conditions.

Conclusion: GAT-PEARL provides a practical, adaptable policy for AET fleet management in dynamic charging environments, demonstrating strong generalization and sample-efficient adaptation without retraining.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, the effective management of Autonomous Electric Taxi (AET) fleets faces a critical challenge in environments with dynamic and uncertain charging availability. While most existing research assumes a static charging network, this simplification creates a significant gap between theoretical models and real-world operations. To bridge this gap, we propose GAT-PEARL, a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework that learns an adaptive operational policy. Our approach integrates a graph attention network (GAT) to effectively extract robust spatial representations under infrastructure layouts and model the complex spatiotemporal relationships of the urban environment, and employs probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic reinforcement learning (PEARL) to enable rapid, inference-based adaptation to changes in charging network layouts without retraining. Through extensive simulations on real-world data in Chengdu, China, we demonstrate that GAT-PEARL significantly outperforms conventional reinforcement learning baselines, showing superior generalization to unseen infrastructure layouts and achieving higher overall operational efficiency in dynamic settings.

### [253] [Distributionally Robust Classification for Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21315)
*Seonghwi Kim,Sung Ho Jo,Wooseok Ha,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributionally robust unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework that accounts for uncertainty in both covariate and conditional label distributions. It yields a practical, scalable algorithm applicable to multi-source and single-source UDA, with strong gains when target unlabeled data are scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA assumes some alignment between source and target distributions, but real-world shifts include changes in feature distribution and label-conditional behavior. When target data are scarce and source correlations are spurious, standard UDA can fail. A framework that explicitly models uncertainty in both the covariate and conditional distributions aims to improve generalization under such shifts.

Method: Define ambiguity sets over the source-target covariate distribution and over the conditional label distribution. Formulate a distributionally robust objective that seeks good performance under worst-case plausible shifts. Develop an efficient optimization algorithm that can be integrated with existing UDA methods, and adapt the framework to both multi-source and single-source settings.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse distribution shift scenarios show consistent improvements over strong baselines, with the largest gains when target unlabeled data are extremely scarce. Ablation studies illustrate the contribution of robustness to both covariate and conditional distribution uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed distributionally robust framework provides a versatile and practical advancement for UDA, bridging multi-source and single-source settings. It improves resilience to scarce target data and distribution shifts while remaining compatible with existing UDA approaches. Future work could explore alternative ambiguity sets and scalability to larger datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

*Aoyu Pang,Maonan Wang,Zifan Sha,Wenwei Yue,Changle Li,Chung Shue Chen,Man-On Pun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) uses a unified optimization model and deep RL with V2X to coordinate vertiport selection and air-taxi routing with ground transport, improving door-to-door efficiency. Code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in systematic, integrated routing for air-ground mobility; current literature lacks a unified framework considering real-time traffic and passenger decision-making.

Method: Develop a unified optimization model for simultaneous air and ground strategy selection, capturing dynamic multimodal networks and real-time traffic; implement a UAGMC framework leveraging deep reinforcement learning and V2X for vertiport selection and dynamic air taxi routing.

Result: Demonstrates a 34% reduction in average travel time over proportional allocation methods; improves overall travel efficiency; provides insights into multimodal integration; code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Foundational contribution toward intelligent urban mobility through coordinated air and ground modes, with potential for extension to more realistic scenarios and broader uptake.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate urban congestion by utilizing low-altitude airspace, thereby reducing pressure on ground transportation networks. To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

### [255] [An introductory Generalization of the standard SVMs loss and its applications to Shallow and Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21331)
*Filippo Portera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a new convex loss for SVMs applicable to classification and regression, with dual formulations and empirical tests on small datasets. Claims potential generalization gains by leveraging pattern correlations within the loss and demonstrates some improvements, including experiments with shallow and deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization of SVM-like losses by incorporating pattern correlations into the loss function, and to provide dual formulations to study optimization properties; extend exploration to neural network applications.

Method: Formulates a new convex loss for SVMs, derives the corresponding dual problems for binary classification and regression, and conducts experiments on several small datasets to evaluate generalization compared to standard losses. Also reports some results when integrating the loss with shallow and deep neural networks.

Result: The loss yields generalization performance that is at least as good as standard losses, with several instances showing improvements. The study is limited by small dataset sizes due to scalability challenges of SVMs.

Conclusion: Pattern-correlated convex loss for SVMs appears promising for improving generalization and can be extended to neural networks; however, larger-scale validation is needed to confirm scalability and robustness beyond small data regimes.

Abstract: We propose a new convex loss for SVMs, both for the binary classification and for the regression models. Therefore, we show the mathematical derivation of the dual problems and we experiment them with several small data-sets. The minimal dimension of those data-sets is due to the difficult scalability of the SVM method to bigger instances. This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures.

### [256] [Memorization Control in Diffusion Models from Denoising-centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21348)
*Thuy Phuong Vu,Mai Viet Hoang Do,Minhhuy Le,Dinh-Cuong Hoang,Phan Xuan Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion model memorization can be mitigated by a denoising-centric timestep sampling strategy that shifts learning toward later denoising steps, controlling memorization via the width of a confidence interval to balance memorization and distributional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memorization remains a risk in diffusion models; traditional fixes are data- or model-centric and treat the model as a standalone predictor. A denoising-centric view can reveal how learning dynamics across denoising steps contribute to memorization and generalization.

Method: Analyse how uniform timestep sampling yields unequal learning contributions due to differing signal-to-noise ratios across denoising steps, leading to memorization bias. Propose a configurable timestep sampling strategy that controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. Introduce a tunable confidence-interval width to directly trade off memorization and generalization.

Result: Empirical results on image and 1D signal generation show that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps reduces memorization and improves alignment with the training data distribution, validating the method's generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Denoising-trajectory-aware timestep sampling provides a general and effective mechanism to regulate memorization in diffusion models, applicable across modalities and capable of achieving tunable generalization via confidence-interval width adjustments.

Abstract: Controlling memorization in diffusion models is critical for applications that require generated data to closely match the training distribution. Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

*Minghao Yang,Ren Togo,Guang Li,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-rank & Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R) for mixture-of-experts; reshapes routing space to low-rank, uses Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to bound Lipschitz and stabilize routing, plus multi-anchor routing; shows improved routing stability, expert specialization, and performance in language and vision MoEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring in traditional linear routers which impair routing discriminability and stable expert specialization.

Method: Propose L2R: 1) expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space; 2) SIPS to bound Lipschitz behavior of routing functions; 3) parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing to enhance expressiveness. Empirical validation on large-scale language MoE and ImageNet vision MoE.

Result: L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance in both language and vision MoE settings.

Conclusion: L2R provides a unified routing framework that reshapes routing space and scoring geometry, improving MoE routing quality and suggesting broad applicability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale neural networks by conditionally activating a small subset of experts, where the router plays a central role in determining expert specialization and overall model performance. However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance.

### [258] [Factored Causal Representation Learning for Robust Reward Modeling in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21350)
*Yupei Yang,Lin Yang,Wanxi Deng,Lin Qu,Fan Feng,Biwei Huang,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a causal, factored reward model for RLHF that separates embedding into causal and non-causal factors; constrains the reward head to the causal component and uses an adversarial head (with gradient reversal) to discourage non-causal encoding of reward, leading to more robust reward models and better RLHF performance, with reduced reward hacking (e.g., length, sycophancy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often latch onto spurious, non-causal features that correlate with human labels, enabling reward hacking and misalignment. A causal, factored representation aims to ensure reward prediction relies only on factors causally related to human preferences.

Method: Decompose the model's contextual embedding into two components: causal factors sufficient for reward prediction and non-causal factors capturing reward-irrelevant attributes. Constrain the reward head to depend only on the causal component. Train an adversarial head to predict reward from non-causal factors and apply gradient reversal to discourage non-causal factors from encoding reward-relevant information.

Result: Empirical evaluation on mathematical and dialogue tasks shows more robust reward models and consistent improvements in downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses indicate reduced reward hacking related to length and sycophantic bias.

Conclusion: A causally aware, factored reward model with an adversarial mechanism against non-causal information improves robustness and RLHF effectiveness, mitigating reward hacking and aligning model behavior more closely with human preferences.

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analytical framework for sizing Attention/FFN bundles in rA-1F LLM decoding. Derives closed-form optimal A/F ratio under probabilistic workload with nonstationary Attention and stable FFN work; validated by trace-calibrated simulator; yields near-optimal throughput and reduced idle time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance sensitivity of Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) to provisioning; enable independent scaling of memory (Attention) and compute (FFN) resources for efficient LLM decoding.

Method: Develop a tractable analytical model of AFD in an rA-1F topology with nonstationary Attention workload (growing context tokens, random-length requests) and stable FFN workload; derive closed-form rules for the optimal Attention/FFN (A/F) ratio using probabilistic workload assumptions; validate the theory with a trace-calibrated AFD simulator.

Result: Derived closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance. Simulation shows theory matches optimum within 10% across workloads and consistently reduces idle time.

Conclusion: Sizing AFD bundles using the derived A/F ratio rules enables near-optimal throughput and improved resource utilization; the framework provides practical guidance for scalable AFD deployments.

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

*Joshua Hang Sai Ip,Georgios Makrygiorgos,Ali Mesbah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EI-GN extends Expected Improvement by optimizing a gradient-aware auxiliary objective to probe regions near high performance and approaching first-order stationarity; shows improved performance on BO benchmarks and in control policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EI tends to be overly exploitative and can miss regions near stationary points. Incorporating gradient information via gradient-enhanced surrogates enables principled gradient inference and guides sampling toward regions with high potential and near-stationarity.

Method: Introduce EI-GN, an acquisition that applies the improvement principle to a gradient-norm objective. Utilize gradient observations to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models, derive a tractable closed-form EI-GN, and ensure consistency with the improvement-based framework; optimize efficiently.

Result: Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks show consistent improvements over standard baselines. Demonstrates applicability to control policy learning problems via gradient-informed sampling.

Conclusion: EI-GN is a principled extension of EI that leverages gradient information to balance exploration and exploitation, steering samples toward high-performing, near-stationarity regions within the improvement framework; suitable for gradient-enhanced BO and policy learning tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a principled approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being one of the most widely used acquisition functions. Despite its empirical success, EI is known to be overly exploitative and can converge to suboptimal stationary points. We propose Expected Improvement via Gradient Norms (EI-GN), a novel acquisition function that applies the improvement principle to a gradient-aware auxiliary objective, thereby promoting sampling in regions that are both high-performing and approaching first-order stationarity. EI-GN relies on gradient observations used to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models that enable principled gradient inference from function evaluations. We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework. Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks demonstrate that EI-GN yields consistent improvements against standard baselines. We further demonstrate applicability of EI-GN to control policy learning problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mean-field interpretation of Transformer forward pass shows the perceptron block induces atomic, localized critical points on the unit sphere under Wasserstein gradient-flow dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a theoretical framework to understand Transformer dynamics by mapping the forward pass to an interacting-particle system on the unit sphere; investigate how the perceptron block shapes the energy landscape and critical points in a mean-field setting.

Method: Model the forward pass as a system of interacting particles on the unit sphere; interpret depth as time; relate to gradient flows of an explicit energy in certain weight regimes; establish a mean-field (infinite context) limit via Wasserstein gradient flows; analyze the impact of the perceptron block on the energy landscape.

Result: In certain weight settings, the dynamics coincide with gradient flow of an explicit energy; critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

Conclusion: The perceptron block leads to sparse, localized critical points in the mean-field, Wasserstein-gradient-flow framework, offering geometric insight into Transformer representations and the role of normalization.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

### [262] [Rethinking Federated Graph Foundation Models: A Graph-Language Alignment-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21369)
*Yinlin Zhu,Di Wu,Xianzhi Zhang,Yuming Ai,Xunkai Li,Miao Hu,Guocong Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGALA aligns pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in a federated setting to overcome semantic-structural orthogonality and knowledge loss from quantization, using unsupervised contrastive learning in a continuous embedding space and prompt-tuning for efficient adaptation; it achieves strong, multi-domain performance gains without full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedGFM approaches rely on vector-quantized backbones that introduce irreversible knowledge loss and struggle with data heterogeneity and communication constraints across distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. A principled alignment between PLMs and GNNs in a continuous space is needed to preserve semantic-structural integrity and enable robust knowledge transfer.

Method: FedGALA employs unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNN encoders with frozen PLMs in a shared continuous embedding space, reducing orthogonality between graph semantics and language semantics. It then uses a communication-efficient prompt-tuning mechanism to steer these aligned encoders and PLMs for downstream tasks, avoiding full-parameter fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multi-domain datasets and multiple tasks shows FedGALA outperforms competitive baselines, with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Conclusion: FedGALA effectively reconciles semantic-structural orthogonality in federated graph foundation models, mitigates data heterogeneity and communication constraints, and demonstrates robust transfer of general knowledge through alignment and prompt-based adaptation.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

### [263] [DA-SPS: A Dual-stage Network based on Singular Spectrum Analysis, Patching-strategy and Spearman-correlation for Multivariate Time-series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21381)
*Tianhao Zhang,Shusen Ma,Yu Kang,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DA-SPS is a two-stage multivariate time-series forecasting model that separately processes the target variable and extraneous variables. It uses SSA to decompose the target, LSTM and P-Conv-LSTM to capture trend/seasonality, and a correlation-based filter plus L-Attention to process extraneous variables, with final fusion yielding state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and a private real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multivariate time-series models often ignore the impact of extraneous variables on the target and underutilize diverse temporal patterns. There is a need to selectively filter relevant extraneous variables and extract complex sequence information across time patterns to improve forecast accuracy.

Method: Two-stage architecture: TVPS (target variable processing) applies Singular Spectrum Analysis to the target sequence, then LSTM and P-Conv-LSTM with a patching strategy to extract trend- and seasonality-related features. EVPS (extraneous variables processing) filters extraneous variables via Spearman correlation with the target and processes them with an L-Attention module combining LSTM and attention mechanism. Final prediction is obtained by weighted summation and linear mapping of TVPS and EVPS outputs.

Result: On four public datasets, the proposed DA-SPS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Its effectiveness is further validated on a private real-world dataset containing laptop motherboard test-item information.

Conclusion: DA-SPS effectively handles extraneous variables and leverages diverse time-pattern information to improve forecasting accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

*Hui Ma,Qingzhong Li,Jin Wang,Jie Wu,Shaoyu Dou,Li Feng,Xinjun Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sim-MSTNet uses sim2real with synthetic data and bi-level optimization to address data scarcity and task imbalance in multi-task spatiotemporal network traffic forecasting, employing attention-based cross-task sharing and dynamic loss weighting, achieving SOTA results on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve generalization in multi-task network traffic forecasting under limited real data and task imbalance/negative transfer across service types.

Method: 1) Use a simulator to generate synthetic traffic data (sim2real pipeline). 2) Apply domain randomization and bi-level optimization to align synthetic and real distributions via sample weighting and model training. 3) Incorporate attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge across tasks. 4) Employ dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives. 5) Evaluate on two open-source datasets against state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets show that Sim-MSTNet outperforms baselines, with improved accuracy and generalization across tasks/services.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles data scarcity and negative transfer in multi-task traffic forecasting, demonstrating enhanced performance and generalization; potential applicability to broader multi-task spatiotemporal forecasting domains.

Abstract: Network traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent network operations, but existing techniques often perform poorly when faced with limited data. Additionally, multi-task learning methods struggle with task imbalance and negative transfer, especially when modeling various service types. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sim-MSTNet, a multi-task spatiotemporal network traffic forecasting model based on the sim2real approach. Our method leverages a simulator to generate synthetic data, effectively addressing the issue of poor generalization caused by data scarcity. By employing a domain randomization technique, we reduce the distributional gap between synthetic and real data through bi-level optimization of both sample weighting and model training. Moreover, Sim-MSTNet incorporates attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge between tasks and applies dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives. Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets show that Sim-MSTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced accuracy and generalization.

### [265] [Intrinsic Reward Policy Optimization for Sparse-Reward Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21391)
*Minjae Cho,Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes IRPO: a policy optimization method using multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize extrinsic return without pretraining subpolicies; uses a surrogate policy gradient for sparse rewards; shows improved performance and sample efficiency; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In sparse-reward RL, exploration is difficult. Intrinsic rewards can guide exploration but prior approaches either miscredit intrinsic signals or require costly subpolicies. A method that directly optimizes extrinsic performance via intrinsic rewards without subpolicy pretraining is desirable.

Method: IRPO forms a surrogate policy gradient combining multiple intrinsic rewards to yield a richer learning signal than the true gradient. It avoids pretraining subpolicies and provides theoretical analysis of the optimization problem. Evaluated in discrete and continuous domains; code released.

Result: IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in both discrete and continuous tasks; formal analysis of the optimization problem; code available.

Conclusion: IRPO provides a principled framework to leverage intrinsic rewards for direct extrinsic optimization, addressing credit assignment and sample efficiency issues without subpolicy pretraining; supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning as an agent relies on trial and error to learn an optimal policy. However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mgineer117/IRPO.

### [266] [Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21418)
*Qian Wan,Ziao Xu,Luona Wei,Xiaoxuan Shen,Jianwen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiPO is a reinforcement-learning-based framework for large reasoning models that learns to model task difficulty and integrate it into policy optimization, reducing overthinking and unnecessary tokens while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often overthink due to reward-driven preferences after post-training and lack of task-difficulty awareness, leading to inefficient reasoning; existing fixes focus on prompts or training but ignore difficulty-aware resource allocation.

Method: Proposes a difficulty modeling module based on the model’s own reasoning (self-reasoning), integrated into a reinforcement learning loop to modulate generation preferences. Introduces a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward that penalizes lengthy reasoning while accounting for reasoning quality and output format. The approach requires less manual annotation and formalizes task complexity.

Result: The model learns to spontaneously reflect task difficulty, achieving substantial reductions in redundant tokens (overthinking) with no loss (or minimal loss) in task performance due to thought compression.

Conclusion: Incorporating task difficulty signals into RL-based training enables LRMs to adapt inference effort to problem complexity, improving efficiency without sacrificing effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

### [267] [Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21419)
*Qing Jin,Chaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for diffusion/flow matching with arbitrary prediction targets, showing when x-prediction is optimal based on data geometry; introduces k-Diff to learn the optimal target k from data; empirically improves image generation across latent and pixel spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work shifts from predicting noise or velocity to direct data (x) in high-dimensional settings. A formal explanation for when and why the optimal target depends on data properties is lacking, hindering principled target selection.

Method: Propose a generalized prediction formulation that encompasses ε-, v-, and x-prediction as special cases. Derive an analytical link between data geometry (ambient vs intrinsic dimension) and the optimal target. Introduce k-Diff, a data-driven framework to learn the optimal prediction parameter k without estimating intrinsic dimension. Validate via extensive experiments in latent-space and pixel-space image generation across architectures and scales.

Result: The theory identifies ambient dimensionality as the key factor governing the optimal target. k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines, demonstrating improved generative performance across diverse architectures and data scales.

Conclusion: A principled, automated approach to target selection in diffusion/flow models is established. The generalized framework explains when x-prediction is superior and provides a practical method (k-Diff) to learn the optimal target from data, enhancing generation quality without explicit dimension estimation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

### [268] [ConceptMoE: Adaptive Token-to-Concept Compression for Implicit Compute Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21420)
*Zihao Huang,Jundong Zhou,Xingwei Qu,Qiyang Min,Ge Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptMoE introduces dynamic concept-level token merging to allocate compute adaptively, achieving efficiency and accuracy gains over standard MoE on language and vision-language tasks, including continual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models allocate uniform compute across tokens; some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. Adaptive compute allocation at the token/concept level could improve efficiency and performance.

Method: A learnable chunk module partitions token sequences by inter-token similarity into concept representations, compressing sequences to a target ratio R before processing in a concept model. The architecture remains MoE-based, enabling controlled evaluation by reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs and total parameters to isolate architectural benefits. Evaluations span language pretraining, long-context understanding, and multimodal benchmarks; continual training with layer looping is also considered.

Result: Across tasks, ConceptMoE yields consistent gains over standard MoE: +0.9 points in language pretraining, +2.3 points in long-context understanding, and +0.6 points in multimodal benchmarks. During continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points. Efficiency gains include reductions in attention computation up to R^2 and KV cache up to R; at R=2, prefill speedups reach 175% and decoding speedups up to 117% on long sequences.

Conclusion: The approach requires minimal architectural changes and can be integrated into existing MoE frameworks. Adaptive concept-level processing improves both effectiveness and efficiency, with practical applicability demonstrated in continual training and notable runtime improvements.

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

### [269] [Lossy Common Information in a Learnable Gray-Wyner Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21424)
*Anderson de Andrade,Alon Harell,Ivan V. Bajić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-channel, learnable codec that splits shared (common) and task-specific information across two vision tasks, guided by Gray-Wyner theory; introduces lossy common information and an objective balancing tradeoffs; empirical results show reduced redundancy and improved performance across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overlapping information across tasks leads to redundancy; conventional codecs ignore shared content. A principled framework (Gray-Wyner) motivates separating common and task-specific signals to improve efficiency in multi-task vision representations.

Method: Develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across tasks. Define and optimize for lossy common information to balance tradeoffs. Compare three codec architectures in two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks.

Result: Redundancy is substantially reduced and independent coding is consistently outperformed across the evaluated tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bringing Gray-Wyner theory into modern ML enables practical gains in multi-task representation learning by explicitly modeling and exploiting shared information across tasks.

Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.

*Hang Ni,Weijia Zhang,Fei Wang,Zezhi Shao,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADI advances multi-modal LLMs for time-series understanding by enforcing patch-level cross-modal alignment, disentangled interaction of modality-common and modality-unique semantics, and critical-token highlighting, achieving robust and superior reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal integration in time-series MLLMs is hampered by fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, hindering localized interpretation and reasoning.

Method: (1) Patch-level Alignment: enforce fine-grained, physically grounded correspondence across modalities; (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction: decompose modality-common semantics into compact discrete latent codes and synergize purified modality-unique information; (3) Critical-token Highlighting: emphasize informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

Conclusion: MADI effectively enables fine-grained cross-modal alignment and disentangled interaction to improve temporal reasoning in multi-modal LLMs.

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

### [271] [Accurate Network Traffic Matrix Prediction via LEAD: an LLM-Enhanced Adapter-Based Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21437)
*Yu Sun,Yaqiong Liu,Nan Cheng,Jiayuan Li,Zihan Jia,Xialin Du,Mugen Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-basedTM forecasting framework (LEAD) that converts traffic matrices to images, uses a frozen LLM with adapters and dual-conditioning to guide prediction, achieving state-of-the-art RMSE on Abilene and GEANT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TM forecasting under stochastic, non-linear, bursty network dynamics is essential for proactive traffic engineering and edge AI, but discriminative models suffer from over-smoothing and limited uncertainty, especially under bursts; existing methods struggle with computation and latency constraints in 6G contexts.

Method: Traffic-to-Image: convert TM to RGB images for global dependencies; Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter to capture temporal semantics efficiently; Dual-Conditioning Strategy to steer diffusion for dynamic TM; evaluation on Abilene and GEANT.

Result: On Abilene: RMSE reduced by 45.2% vs best baseline; one-step RMSE 0.1098, 20-step 0.1134. On GEANT: RMSE 0.0258 at 20 steps, 27.3% below best baseline.

Conclusion: LEAD demonstrates strong performance gains by combining vision-based TM representation with LLM-guided diffusion, suggesting a viable path for accurate, uncertainty-aware TM forecasting under stringent latency.

Abstract: Driven by the evolution toward 6G and AI-native edge intelligence, network operations increasingly require predictive and risk-aware adaptation under stringent computation and latency constraints. Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a "Traffic-to-Image" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a "Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline.

*Francesco Zola,Lucia Muñoz,Andrea Venturi,Amaia Gil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAEs trained on synthetic graphs of money-laundering-like patterns; GAE-GCN most robust across patterns; GAEs trained unsupervised via reconstruction error; synthetic data mitigates real-data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome scarcity and privacy constraints of labeled illicit-finance graphs by using parametrized synthetic data to study whether GAEs can learn and distinguish topological patterns associated with illicit activity.

Method: Generate seven illicit-pattern synthetic graphs with parametrized generators preserving structural realism. Train three GAEs (GCN, SAGE, GAT) without labels, using reconstruction error as the learning signal. Compare reconstruction performance across patterns.

Result: GAE-GCN provides the most consistent reconstruction across patterns; GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT are competitive only on a subset of patterns.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation learning on synthetic data is a viable path toward AI-assisted detection of illicit behaviors, helping to mitigate data access limitations.

Abstract: Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets.

### [273] [SAGE: Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21452)
*Yu Xie,Xing Kai Ren,Ying Qi,Hu Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE is proposed to overcome tokenization constraints and gradient issues in OneRec-like LLM-recommender systems by (i) decoupling sequence-level signals to avoid token-level variance and reward collapse, and (ii) introducing asymmetric adaptive dynamics with a Boost Factor for cold-start items and an entropy-aware penalty to maintain diversity, achieving cold-start unblock and stable performance without sacrificing GBPO stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient reuse of open-source LLM architectures in recommender systems without building a separate token vocabulary, and to address the Symmetric Conservatism in OneRec's GBPO that inhibits updates for cold-start items and risks diversity collapse in high-noise settings.

Method: Introduce SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution) with two core components: (1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling that uses a geometric mean importance ratio combined with decoupled multi-objective advantages to remove token-level variance and mitigate Reward Collapse; (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics that defines a dynamic gradient manifold with a Boost Factor to amplify updates for high-potential cold-start items and an Entropy Aware Penalty to prevent information cocoons and encourage exploration.

Result: Theoretical analyses and empirical experiments show that SAGE effectively unlocks cold-start traffic, preserves recommendation diversity, and maintains numerical stability comparable to GBPO, while improving overall performance.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a unified optimization framework for list-wise generative recommendations that simultaneously improves cold-start dynamics and diversity without sacrificing stability, addressing key weaknesses in OneRec/GBPO and enabling easier reuse of open-source LLM architectures.

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cognitive-level simulation in LLM role-play by addressing lack of high-quality reasoning traces and aligned reward signals, enabling inner-thought-like reasoning while maintaining safety and alignment.

Method: Propose dual-layer thinking; curate reasoning-augmented data via reverse engineering; define human-aligned principles and reward models; train HER models based on Qwen3-32B with supervised learning and RL.

Result: Significant performance gains: +30.26 on CoSER, +14.97 on Minimax Role-Play Bench over Qwen3-32B baseline; robust validation across experiments.

Conclusion: Release datasets, principles, and models; demonstrate feasibility of cognitive simulation in LLM role-play and set resources for future research.

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Motivation: Address inefficiencies of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dynamic routing (hardware inefficiency, auxiliary losses) and the lack of contextual information in pure tokenizer embeddings by introducing a new, scalable sparsity axis in decoder layers.

Method: Introduce L^3 with static token-based routing that aggregates a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way; two main components: (1) systems-friendly architecture for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, (2) information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm to balance speed and quality.

Result: Trained transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters; L^3 substantially outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in language modeling and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: L^3 opens a new sparsity axis for decoder layers by leveraging token-based embeddings with context-aware aggregation, enabling efficient memory–compute trade-offs and practical scalability.

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

### [276] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Near-complete minimax regret characterization for partial-feedback online learning under set realizability; introduces PFLdim and PMSdim; shows deterministic vs randomized separations, and intractability outside realizability; extends to set-valued learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Because language generation and similar tasks have multiple valid outputs but only a single reference, there is partial feedback; we need new complexity notions beyond standard Littlestone dimension to understand learnability.

Method: Define Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) via a collection version space and an auxiliary dimension; develop Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) for randomized learners; derive tight minimax regret bounds; establish inseparability results under conditions (finite Helly number, nested-inclusion label structure); extend to set-valued online learning; compare to realistic/agnostic variants.

Result: PFLdim exactly characterizes deterministic learnability and minimax regret; PMSdim gives tight bounds for randomized learners; proves broad conditions for deterministic vs randomized inseparability; resolves Raman et al. open question for set-valued learning; shows potential linear regret outside set realizability even for |H|=2, indicating information-theoretic intractability without realizability.

Conclusion: Pushes beyond traditional realizability with new complexity measures; clarifies when partial-feedback learning is feasible; highlights necessity of noise-sensitive measures; implications for language generation and related domains; suggests future work on extending these measures and exploring more general feedback models.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

*Guillaume Lauga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework for non-convex composite optimization with convergence guarantees, unifying Graphical Lasso solvers and delivering large iteration-efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited theoretical understanding of non-convex optimization and provide a unifying, convergent framework for BCD methods applicable to large-scale problems, notably sparse precision matrix estimation.

Method: Introduce a flexible BCD framework that supports variable-metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternating minimization; show that the framework encompasses graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC solvers.

Result: Prove convergence guarantees for the non-convex setting and demonstrate substantial practical efficiency, achieving up to 100-fold reductions in iterations to reach high-quality estimates in sparse precision matrix estimation.

Conclusion: A broadly applicable, convergent BCD framework for non-convex composite optimization that not only unifies major Graphical Lasso solvers but also delivers significant computational speedups in practice.

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

### [278] [PPI-SVRG: Unifying Prediction-Powered Inference and Variance Reduction for Semi-Supervised Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21470)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Haoyang Liu,David Simchi-Levi,Will Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPI and SVRG are two variance-reduction techniques that are shown to be equivalent; the paper unifies them into PPI-SVRG, yielding a convergence bound with the SVRG rate plus an error term from prediction uncertainty. Predictions influence the neighborhood size rather than the rate; perfect predictions recover SVRG, while noisy predictions set an error floor. Empirically, PPI-SVRG yields substantial gains under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient stochastic optimization when annotations are scarce but access to pre-trained predictions exists, by unifying prediction-based and gradient-based variance reduction.

Method: Prove mathematical equivalence between Prediction-Perturbed Iterates (PPI) and SVRG; derive PPI-SVRG that combines both approaches; derive decomposition of convergence bound into standard SVRG rate and prediction-induced error floor; analyze dependence on loss geometry and prediction quality; validate on mean estimation benchmarks and MNIST with limited labels.

Result: Convergence bound decomposes into SVRG rate plus a prediction-uncertainty error floor; with perfect predictions, it reduces to SVRG; with degraded predictions, convergence stabilizes within a larger neighborhood; empirical results show 43–52% MSE reduction under label scarcity and 2.7–2.9 percentage point accuracy gain on MNIST with 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: PPI-SVRG is a robust variance-reduction strategy for semi-supervised stochastic optimization: it preserves the SVRG rate in ideal conditions and gracefully degrades with prediction noise, delivering substantial empirical gains under scarce labeling.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

### [279] [Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Siyang Gao,Hanwei Li,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fixed-confidence best-arm identification problem with a biased, context-dependent proxy and selective ground-truth auditing is tackled. The authors show bias leads to persistent mis-selection, and they propose an estimator that fuses proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals, plus anytime-valid confidence sequences, to guide an adaptive auditing algorithm achieving near-oracle efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many practical settings (e.g., LLM judges) cheap proxies provide biased cues for arm quality. Unlike standard multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased and ground truth can only be obtained sparingly via auditing. This necessitates bias-aware estimation and selective auditing to avoid waste and mis-selection.

Method: 1) Develop a mean estimator that combines proxy information with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals. 2) Construct anytime-valid confidence sequences for this estimator. 3) Propose an adaptive algorithm that concentrates audits on uncertain contexts and close arms, using a plug-in Neyman rule for near-oracle audit efficiency.

Result: Demonstrate that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish even with unlimited proxy data. The proposed estimator + confidence sequences enable effective adaptive auditing, achieving near-oracle efficiency, with theoretical guarantees and favorable empirical performance in simulations.

Conclusion: Accounting for bias and selective auditing is crucial in fixed-confidence BAI with proxies. The proposed framework provides bias-corrected estimation, valid uncertainty quantification, and an efficient audit strategy, improving accuracy and resource use. The results suggest strong performance and potential applicability to real-world auditing scenarios with biased proxies.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

*Xiuyu Li,Jinkai Zhang,Mingyang Yi,Yu Li,Longqiang Wang,Yue Wang,Ju Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free inference method that samples from an optimal RL policy for language models by combining a reference policy with an energy term; Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS) estimates the energy online via Monte Carlo with convergence guarantees, enabling efficient, high-quality generation across MLM and diffusion-based LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bypass costly and unstable RL post-training alignment by enabling direct sampling from an optimal policy at test time, reducing training complexity and latency.

Method: Define transition probability as a product of a reference policy and an energy term; estimate the energy term online using Monte Carlo with convergence guarantees; accelerate inference with modern frameworks and tailored importance sampling to maintain sampling quality while reducing latency.

Result: Empirical results show ETS improves generation quality across MLMs (autoregressive and diffusion language models) on reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks, with substantial latency reductions and preserved sampling fidelity.

Conclusion: ETS provides a training-free, provably convergent, efficient approach for sampling from the optimal RL policy in language models, enabling practical deployment without costly RL post-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

### [281] [Task-Awareness Improves LLM Generations and Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21500)
*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent-structure Bayesian decoding framework for LLMs that computes Bayes-optimal outputs in a task-specific latent space, surpassing standard decoding and enabling uncertainty via Bayesian risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding and uncertainty estimation operate in language space and ignore latent structural information (labels, numbers, graphs). Incorporating latent structure can improve accuracy, reliability, and task alignment.

Method: Model LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure; define a dissimilarity measure on the latent space; compute Bayes-optimal responses by combining individual latent outputs; quantify uncertainty via Bayesian risk.

Result: Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform beam search across tasks; Bayesian risk-based uncertainty correlates with output quality/correctness and improves alignment.

Conclusion: The decision-theoretic latent-structure framework is broadly applicable to any problem with latent response structure, enabling more reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

### [282] [Cascaded Transfer: Learning Many Tasks under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21513)
*Eloi Campagne,Yvenn Amara-Ouali,Yannig Goude,Mathilde Mougeot,Argyris Kalogeratos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Cascaded Transfer Learning for many-task problems with unknown task relationships; builds a rooted tree of tasks and transfers knowledge cascaded along its edges, guided by a minimum spanning tree budget allocation to improve accuracy under cost constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many-task learning, relating a large set of tasks when their interdependencies are unknown is difficult; effective knowledge transfer must be budget-aware to ensure scalable performance.

Method: Proposes a cascaded transfer mechanism arranged over a minimum spanning tree that connects tasks by a distance measure; uses a rooted tree to define the learning order and allocates the training budget along branches, enabling hierarchical parameter transfer among same-class models.

Result: Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world many-task settings show the method achieves higher accuracy and more cost-effective adaptation across large task collections than alternative approaches.

Conclusion: Cascaded Transfer Learning offers a scalable, budget-aware framework for cross-task knowledge transfer in many-task learning, improving accuracy while respecting resource constraints.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

### [283] [A Unified SPD Token Transformer Framework for EEG Classification: Systematic Comparison of Geometric Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21521)
*Chi-Sheng Chen,En-Jui Kuo,Guan-Ying Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper links SPD embedding geometry to optimization dynamics, deriving gradient-conditioning, normalization, and distance-preservation results; and shows a Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art across EEG tasks, with BWSPD offering competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address how embedding choices for SPD matrices (EEG covariance on SPD manifold) affect training stability, gradient conditioning, and empirical performance, bridging geometry with optimization dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis using Daleckii–Krein matrices to compare gradient conditioning of BWSPD vs Log-Euclidean; derivation of Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) error; proof of bi-Lipschitz distance preservation for BWSPD; large-scale empirical evaluation (≈1,500 runs, 3 EEG paradigms, 36 subjects) comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within a unified Transformer framework.

Result: (1) BWSPD achieves sqrt(κ) gradient conditioning vs κ for Log-Euclidean in high dimensions (d≥22); advantage diminishes for low dimensions (d≤8) due to eigendecomposition overhead. (2) BN-Embed approximates Riemannian normalization to O(ε^2); yields +26% accuracy on 56-channel ERP data, negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, in line with channel-count predictions. (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds show BWSPD preserves manifold distances with distortion governed solely by κ.; (4) Log-Euclidean Transformer attains state-of-the-art across motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP datasets; BWSPD competitive with similar training time.

Conclusion: Embedding geometry matters for optimization on SPD manifolds; Log-Euclidean embedding with a Transformer provides best overall performance across EEG tasks, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with favorable conditioning in certain regimes; theory aligns with empirical findings across channel counts and paradigms.

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

### [284] [More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522)
*Sagi Meir,Tommer D. Keidar,Noam Levi,Shlomi Reuveni,Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Reset-and-Discard (ReD) to improve coverage@cost for evaluating LLMs by exploiting the observed power-law behavior of pass@k. ReD increases unique question coverage under a fixed budget, allows predicting savings and inferring the power-law exponent, and demonstrates cost-efficient evaluation on HumanEval across three models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of LLMs under budget constraints often uses pass@k, but at fixed budgets this yields diminishing returns. A metric like coverage@cost captures how many unique questions are answered as a function of attempts. The work connects these metrics and offers a method to optimize coverage and to infer or predict power-law exponents.

Method: Introduce Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query strategy that, given a fixed budget, increases coverage@cost by resetting the model and discarding unproductive attempts to maximize the number of unique questions answered. The method provides a way to predict, from a given pass@k, the expected saving in total attempts, and can infer the power-law exponent if pass@k is not available.

Result: Empirical results on three LLMs using HumanEval show that ReD substantially reduces the number of attempts, tokens, and USD cost needed to reach a target coverage, while also enabling efficient measurement of inference power-laws.

Conclusion: ReD offers a universal, budget-aware querying strategy to boost coverage@cost, enabling more cost-effective evaluation of LLMs and providing mechanisms to predict savings and infer power-law exponents, with demonstrated gains on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

### [285] [Explicit Credit Assignment through Local Rewards and Dependence Graphs in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21523)
*Bang Giang Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based credit assignment method for cooperative MARL that blends global and local rewards by using an approximated interaction graph to attribute contributions more finely than a global reward while maintaining faster learning from local rewards; empirically improves over standard reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully cooperative MARL suffers from noisy global rewards and credit assignment challenges; local rewards speed learning but can be suboptimal for global coordination. A method that combines both aims to retain cooperation benefits while enabling effective credit attribution.

Method: Constructs an interaction graph among agents to capture fine-grained contributions. Uses this graph to derive agent-specific credit signals that lie between the global reward and pure local rewards. Proposes a practical approach to approximate the interaction graph for scalability and applicability.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed graph-based credit assignment yields improvements over traditional local and global reward baselines, demonstrating flexibility across scenarios.

Conclusion: A graph-informed credit assignment framework bridges the gap between local and global rewards, offering a practical, scalable approach to improve cooperation and learning efficiency in MARL.

Abstract: To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.

### [286] [Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization for Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22020)
*Chengyi Cai,Zesheng Ye,Peike Li,Bo Han,Jianzhong Qi,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ViKeR introduces visual-guided key-token regularization for unlearning in multimodal LLMs, using irrelevant visuals to shape token-level post-unlearning distributions and entropy-based key-token weighting with gradient reweighting; shows improved unlearning with reduced forgetting on MLLMU and CLEAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in multimodal LLMs is needed to prevent leakage of private image information; existing approaches treat output tokens uniformly and ignore visual cues, leading to suboptimal unlearning and potential leakage.

Method: Propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR): identify key tokens via information entropy; use irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token distributions; regularize the model to align outputs with these distributions; apply token-level gradient reweighting to amplify updates on key tokens.

Result: Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks show effective unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

Conclusion: ViKeR demonstrates that leveraging visual context and information-theoretic token importance improves unlearning in multimodal LLMs and provides a practical framework for privacy-preserving AI in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a distance-to-hyperplane-based Lorentz linear layer to fix scaling issues in hyperbolic neural networks, achieving linear growth of hyperbolic output norms with gradient steps and offering efficiency gains via activation functions and caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic geometry provides compact, hierarchical representations. However, existing Lorentz linear layers cause the hyperbolic norms of outputs to scale logarithmically with gradient steps, eroding the benefits. A formulation that preserves hyperbolic geometry while being computationally efficient is needed.

Method: Introduce a Lorentz linear layer based on the distance-to-hyperplane formulation. Provide theoretical proofs that output hyperbolic norms scale linearly with the number of gradient descent steps. Enhance efficiency with Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy, enabling practical hyperbolic networks.

Result: Theoretically established linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to gradient steps. Demonstrated efficiency gains through activations and caching. Codebase released for replication and further development.

Conclusion: The proposed formulation preserves hyperbolic geometry in neural networks, reducing the computation gap to Euclidean networks and enabling more practical, scalable hyperbolic models.

Abstract: Hyperbolic space is quickly gaining traction as a promising geometry for hierarchical and robust representation learning. A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

*Lige Zhang,Ali Maatouk,Jialin Chen,Leandros Tassiulas,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Expert Modulation framework (MoME) for multi-modal time series forecasting that uses textual signals to condition both routing and expert computation in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, addressing token-level fusion limitations and improving prediction accuracy; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series are dynamic and challenging to forecast. Multi-modal methods using text (e.g., news) often rely on token-level fusion, which underperforms when time-text pairs are scarce and when time-series scales vary, hindering cross-modal alignment.

Method: Introduce Expert Modulation (MoME), a cross-modal paradigm that conditions MoE routing and expert computations on textual signals, enabling direct cross-modal control over expert behavior. This leverages a Mixture-of-Experts framework with text-informed gating and expert modulation.

Result: Theoretical analysis accompanied by comprehensive experiments show substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MoME provides efficient cross-modal control of expert behavior in MoE for time series forecasting and demonstrates strong empirical gains; the approach addresses alignment issues in token-level fusion and is complemented by publicly available code.

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

TL;DR: Transformer-based pan-cancer model (HistoPrism) predicts spatial gene expression from H&E histology, with pathway-level evaluation showing improved biological coherence and cross-cancer generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need generalizable models across cancer types and biologically meaningful signals; prior work focused on per-cancer, variance-based metrics with limited functional interpretation.

Method: Efficient transformer-based architecture (HistoPrism) for pan-cancer gene expression prediction from histology; introduces a pathway-level benchmark to assess coherent functional pathways rather than individual gene variance.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on highly variable genes and achieves substantial gains at pathway level; demonstrates recovery of coherent transcriptomic patterns; benefits from pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: HistoPrism sets a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from histology by delivering biologically coherent, generalizable, and efficient predictions.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

### [290] [SAL: Selective Adaptive Learning for Backpropagation-Free Training with Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21561)
*Fanping Liu,Hua Yang,Jiasi Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAL proposes selective adaptive learning that partitions parameters into sample-dependent regions to reduce gradient interference and relax weight symmetry, achieving competitive convergence and scalability up to 1B parameters and 128-layer networks across 10 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address intrinsic limitations of Backpropagation: biologically implausible weight symmetry, gradient interference in dense representations, and scalability concerns in deep/large models; seek a plausible, scalable alternative.

Method: Selective parameter activation with adaptive area partitioning; decomposes the parameter space into mutually exclusive, sample-dependent regions; decouples gradient flows to mitigate interference across divergent semantic patterns; uses refined feedback alignment to address weight symmetry.

Result: Empirical results show competitive convergence rates and improved classification accuracy across 10 benchmarks; SAL exhibits numerical consistency and competitive performance in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters).

Conclusion: SAL offers a biologically inspired, scalable alternative to Backpropagation, contributing to the study of training large neural networks and enabling plausible, efficient learning with reduced gradient interference.

Abstract: Standard deep learning relies on Backpropagation (BP), which is constrained by biologically implausible weight symmetry and suffers from significant gradient interference within dense representations. To mitigate these bottlenecks, we propose Selective Adaptive Learning (SAL), a training method that combines selective parameter activation with adaptive area partitioning. Specifically, SAL decomposes the parameter space into mutually exclusive, sample-dependent regions. This decoupling mitigates gradient interference across divergent semantic patterns and addresses explicit weight symmetry requirements through our refined feedback alignment. Empirically, SAL demonstrates competitive convergence rates, leading to improved classification performance across 10 standard benchmarks. Additionally, SAL achieves numerical consistency and competitive accuracy even in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters). Our approach is loosely inspired by biological learning mechanisms, offering a plausible alternative that contributes to the study of scalable neural network training.

### [291] [Representation Unlearning: Forgetting through Information Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21564)
*Antonio Almudévar,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Represents unlearning in the model's representation space via an information bottleneck, using variational surrogates; supports both full data and zero-shot forgetting, yielding better forgetting, utility, and efficiency than parameter-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and robustness concerns motivate removing the influence of specific training data. Parameter-centric unlearning can be unstable, costly, and rely on local approximations; a representation-space approach aims for global, efficient forgetting.

Method: Propose Representation Unlearning: learn a transformation on representations that enforces an information bottleneck by maximizing mutual information with retained data and minimizing information about forgotten data. Derive tractable variational surrogates and instantiate them in two regimes: (1) retain+forget data available; (2) zero-shot where only forget data is accessible.

Result: Empirical evaluation across several benchmarks shows more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and lower computational cost than parameter-centric baselines.

Conclusion: Representation Unlearning offers a practical, efficient alternative to updating model parameters for forgetting. It demonstrates robustness and efficiency gains, with potential for broader applicability; future work could explore scalability, integration with diverse architectures, and detailed privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specific training data from a model, a need driven by privacy regulations and robustness concerns. Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations. We introduce Representation Unlearning, a framework that performs unlearning directly in the model's representation space. Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.

*Yutao Jin,Yuang Tao,Junyong Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexCausal introduces a block-diagonal covariance VAE with a Factorized Flow-based Prior to model non-Gaussian exogenous noise and disentangle causal factors, guided by supervised alignment, counterfactual constraints, and a manifold-aware intervention strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard mean-field diagonally-parameterized posteriors and isotropic Gaussian priors conflate latent factors and hinder accurate causal disentanglement; real-world exogenous noise exhibits non-Gaussian statistics requiring richer priors.

Method: Use a block-diagonal covariance VAE to allow latent subspaces; Factorized Flow-based Prior to model exogenous noise; supervised alignment with ground-truth causal structure; counterfactual consistency constraints; manifold-aware relative intervention for high-fidelity generation.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show FlexCausal significantly outperforms competing methods.

Conclusion: FlexCausal provides precise structural correspondence between latent subspaces and causal relations and decouples learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics via richer priors and interventions.

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

### [293] [Bridging Functional and Representational Similarity via Usable Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21568)
*Antonio Almudévar,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified usable-information framework linking functional and representational similarity, revealing symmetry/asymmetry of stitching, estimator relationships for reconstruction-based metrics, and a task-granularity hierarchy culminating in input reconstruction as the most granular representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge disparate similarity notions (functional and representational) using a single information-theoretic quantity (usable information) and clarify how observer capacity affects perceived similarity.

Method: Theoretical derivations and proofs: (i) link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information; (ii) proof of asymmetry in stitching requiring bidirectional analysis; (iii) demonstration that reconstruction-based metrics and tools (CKA, RSA) estimate usable information under constraints; (iv) argument that similarity depends on predictive family capacity; (v) establish task-granularity hierarchy showing that similarity on fine-grained tasks implies similarity on coarser tasks; (vi) position input reconstruction as the limit of granularity.

Result: Proved: stitching performance is tied to conditional mutual information and is asymmetric; reconstruction-based metrics and common representational similarity tools estimate usable information under certain constraints; similarity is contingent on observer/predictive capacity; representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity; a hierarchy where complex-task similarity implies coarser similarity; input reconstruction represents maximal granularity.

Conclusion: The framework unifies functional and representational similarity through usable information, clarifies when these notions align, and highlights the role of task granularity and observer capacity. It also legitimizes common metrics as estimators and sets constraints for interpreting their results.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantifying the similarity between representations through the lens of \textit{usable information}, offering a rigorous theoretical and empirical synthesis across three key dimensions. First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.

### [294] [Shaping capabilities with token-level data filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21571)
*Neil Rathi,Alec Radford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token-level filtering during pretraining can effectively reduce undesired capabilities in language models, outperforming document-level filtering, and scales well with model size while preserving alignment on targeted domains; it introduces a token-labeling pipeline using sparse autoencoders and cheap classifiers and is robust to noisy labels under sufficient compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post hoc safety measures are often bypassed by adversaries. Shaping capabilities at pretraining time offers a more robust defense. The abstract uses a medical capability removal proxy to demonstrate the viability of data filtering as a scalable safety intervention.

Method: Compare token-level versus document-level data filtering during pretraining. Develop a token-labeling pipeline: use sparse autoencoders to label tokens, distill cheap classifiers to filter tokens, and apply this filtering to pretraining data. Evaluate across model scales, analyze compute implications, and assess whether models maintain alignment on a forget-domain task.

Result: Token filtering achieves the same reduction in undesired capabilities as document filtering but at lower cost to benign performance. Scaling improves effectiveness with model size; the largest models exhibit a substantial (reported as 7000x) compute slowdown on the forget domain. Models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. They also introduce a token-labeling technique based on sparse autoencoders and cheap classifiers, and show robustness to noisy labels given sufficient pretraining compute.

Conclusion: Token-level data filtering is a scalable and effective pretraining intervention to mitigate undesired capabilities, outperforming document-level filtering while preserving benign behavior and alignment on target domains. The work provides a practical labeling methodology and demonstrates robustness to label noise; future work should clarify metrics and extend to more domains and capability types.

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

### [295] [Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions for Gradient-Free Optimization of Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21572)
*Jinhao Li,Yuhao Sun,Zhiyuan Ma,Hao He,Xinche Zhang,Xing Chen,Jin Li,Sen Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR) for gradient-free optimization of recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs), stabilizing high-variance updates by bounding KL divergence with signal-energy normalization; instantiated for Bernoulli connectivity; paired with a bitset implementation to accelerate training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Population-based, gradient-free methods coolly sidestep non-differentiable spike dynamics but suffer high-variance, unstable updates in high-dimensional, long-horizon RL. A trust-region in distribution space—adaptively scaled by signal energy—can stabilize updates and improve data efficiency and performance.

Method: Define SATR as a distributional update rule that constrains relative policy change by KL divergence normalized by estimated signal energy. The trust region expands with strong signals and contracts when updates are noise-dominated. Implement SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions in RSNNs. Introduce a bitset-based implementation for binary spiking and binary weights to reduce computation and enable scalable RSNN policy search.

Result: Empirically, SATR improves stability under limited populations and yields competitive returns on high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, matching or exceeding strong baselines including PPO-LSTM.

Conclusion: SATR provides a scalable, robust gradient-free optimization framework for RSNN policy learning, leveraging adaptive distributional trust regions and efficient bitset acceleration to enable effective, high-dimensional RSNN control.

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are a promising substrate for energy-efficient control policies, but training them for high-dimensional, long-horizon reinforcement learning remains challenging. Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.

*Mutian Yang,Zisen Zhan,Yutong Chen,Haolin Li,Kaiwen Wang,Kaili Zheng,Yuguang Wang,Qi Wang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A gradient-based theory explains catastrophic forgetting in knowledge injection; identifies conflicting vs collaborative neurons via gradient similarity and introduces Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL) that freezes conflicting neurons. It achieves near-zero forgetting in ideal conditions and substantial forgetting reductions across diverse models and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection undermines continual learning in LLMs. Existing methods lack a foundational theoretical explanation. A gradient-centric framework is proposed to explain forgetting and guide mitigation.

Method: Develop a gradient-based theoretical framework; prove that strongly negative gradient similarity causes forgetting. Use gradient similarity to classify neurons as conflicting (50%-75%) and collaborative (25%-50%). Propose CNL: freeze conflicting neurons and update collaborative neurons; provide theoretical guarantee of zero forgetting under infinitesimal learning rate and exact mastered set.

Result: Experiments across five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

Conclusion: Gradient similarity offers a causal explanation for forgetting and guides neuron-level interventions. CNL can theoretically eliminate forgetting under ideal conditions and yields substantial empirical improvements across diverse tasks, suggesting strong potential for robust continual learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

*Morten Blørstad,Herman Jangsett Mostein,Nello Blaser,Pekka Parviainen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BatchEnsemble provides scalable, competitive uncertainty estimation for tabular and time-series data, matching deep ensembles with fewer parameters; GRUBE extends BatchEnsemble to GRU for sequential modeling, and outperforms MC dropout while staying efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation in deep learning remains computationally expensive. Deep ensembles and MC dropout have limitations in terms of resource usage and calibration. A scalable, accurate uncertainty method applicable to both tabular and sequential data is highly desirable.

Method: Propose BatchEnsemble as a general uncertainty estimation method, introduce GRUBE as a BatchEnsemble-based GRU cell for sequential modeling, and compare against Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles on tabular and time-series tasks to evaluate predictive performance and uncertainty estimation.

Result: BatchEnsemble achieves uncertainty estimation performance comparable to deep ensembles and superior to Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE attains similar or better predictive and uncertainty performance, with fewer parameters and reduced training/inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble and GRUBE offer efficient, competitive uncertainty estimation suitable as scalable alternatives to deep ensembles for both tabular and sequential data.

Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with uncertainty estimation. Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks. To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

### [298] [CORDS: Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21583)
*Tin Hadži Veljković,Erik Bekkers,Michael Tiemann,Jan-Willem van de Meent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORDS provides a continuous, invertible representation for variable-sized sets by mapping to density and feature fields, enabling end-to-end learning in field space with exact decodability back to discrete sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting variable-sized sets is common but padding or inferring set size is problematic; there is a need for permutation-invariant, scalable representations that integrate with standard deep-learning pipelines.

Method: Introduce an invertible mapping from a set of spatial objects to two continuous fields over a shared support: a density field encoding locations and counts, and a feature field encoding attributes. Models operate in field space and can exactly decode to a discrete set via the inverse mapping. The approach handles unknown cardinalities without explicit size inference.

Result: Demonstrates robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy across multiple tasks: molecular generation/regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima.

Conclusion: Continuous, invertible field representations enable exact decodability of variable-sized sets, facilitate learning in a continuous space, and show broad applicability across domains with competitive performance.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

### [299] [Heterogeneity-Aware Knowledge Sharing for Graph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21589)
*Wentao Yu,Sheng Wan,Shuo Chen,Bo Han,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSSA tackles node-feature and topology heterogeneity in graph federated learning by semantic alignment of node distributions and spectral alignment of graph structure, using cluster-level representations to share knowledge. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets and partition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFL suffers from heterogeneity across clients in two aspects: (i) diverse node feature distributions (semantic heterogeneity) and (ii) diverse graph topologies (structural heterogeneity). A method that jointly aligns semantic and structural information across clients is needed to improve generalization and performance.

Method: 1) Node-feature heterogeneity: introduce a variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, cluster clients by these distributions, build cluster-level representative distributions, and minimize divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to share semantic knowledge. 2) Structural heterogeneity: use spectral Graph Neural Networks and define a spectral energy measure to quantify structural information, cluster clients by spectral energy, construct cluster-level spectral GNNs, and align local spectral features with cluster-level spectral GNNs to share structural knowledge. 3) Training scheme aggregates both semantic and structural alignments across clusters.

Result: Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets, under non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning, show FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedSSA provides a unified framework for semantic and structural alignment in graph federated learning, effectively mitigating both feature- and topology-driven heterogeneity and delivering superior performance across diverse datasets and partitioning settings.

Abstract: Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

### [300] [Scalable Power Sampling: Unlocking Efficient, Training-Free Reasoning for LLMs via Distribution Sharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21590)
*Xiaotong Ji,Rasul Tutunov,Matthieu Zimmer,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free, verifier-free autoregressive sharpening method approximates the global power distribution with a token-level scaled low-temperature distribution, enabling RL-like gains without rewards and with far lower latency than MCMC-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training gains may stem from distribution sharpening rather than acquiring new capabilities; MCMC sampling of LLMs’ power distribution can match RL gains but is computationally expensive. A scalable, reward-free alternative is sought.

Method: Derives that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature distribution, where the scale captures future trajectory quality. Introduces a training-free, verifier-free autoregressive sharpening algorithm and evaluates it across math, QA, and code tasks on four LLMs.

Result: The approach matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without external rewards and reduces inference latency by more than 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling, demonstrated on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs.

Conclusion: A theoretically grounded, practical alternative to RL post-training that sharpens the base model’s distribution without training or external rewards, achieving competitive performance with markedly lower latency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

### [301] [Dynamics Reveals Structure: Challenging the Linear Propagation Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21601)
*Hoyeon Chang,Bálint Mucsányi,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether first-order updates in neural networks preserve logical coherence under the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA) using relation algebra. It shows negation and converse require a tensor factorization separating context from relation content; composition reduces to conjunction, forcing bilinear feature maps, which cannot accommodate negation, effectively collapsing the representation. Implications suggest common causes for knowledge editing failures, reversal problems, and multi-hop reasoning stem from LPA's structural limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and test the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA) in neural updates for logical coherence using relation algebra.

Method: Formal analysis of three relation-operations (negation, converse, composition) within relation algebra. Proves that direction-agnostic first-order propagation requires tensor factorization for negation/converse; shows composition collapses to conjunction and that any well-defined conjunction on linear features must be bilinear, which contradicts negation.

Result: Negation and converse demand a tensor-factorized structure; composition presents a fundamental obstruction by enforcing bilinearity, incompatible with negation, leading to a collapse of the feature map. This points to structural limitations of LPA as a source of failures in knowledge editing, reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: LPA's geometry imposes hard constraints that can undermine coherent logical propagation. The observed failures in editing, reasoning, and related tasks may reflect these intrinsic limitations rather than dataset or optimization issues; alternative representations or higher-order mechanisms may be required to preserve logical coherence.

Abstract: Neural networks adapt through first-order parameter updates, yet it remains unclear whether such updates preserve logical coherence. We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTReFT shifts test-time adaptation from model parameters to latent representations using uncertainty-guided node selection, low-rank representation interventions, and an intervention-aware masked autoencoder, delivering theoretical guarantees and strong OOD performance across five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs degrade on out-of-distribution data and parameter-finetuning methods suffer catastrophic forgetting; there is a need for robust test-time adaptation that preserves pre-trained knowledge by updating representations rather than parameters.

Method: Introduce TTReFT with three components: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection to target interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions to limit changes and preserve prior knowledge, (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that adapts masking policy to the selection scheme; provide theoretical guarantees for OOD; evaluate on five benchmark datasets.

Result: Empirical results show TTReFT yields consistent and superior performance on five benchmark datasets; theoretical guarantees for OOD settings.

Conclusion: Representation finetuning is a viable and practical new paradigm for graph test-time training, combining theoretical grounding with strong empirical performance and deployment utility.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.

### [303] [Breaking the Overscaling Curse: Thinking Parallelism Before Parallel Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21619)
*Yiming Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Global fixed parallelism for multi-path sampling is inefficient due to sample heterogeneity; a lightweight per-sample method (T2) uses latent representations to estimate optimal parallelism before decoding, reducing cost while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overscaling curse: system-level parallelism overshoots for some samples and undershoots for others; demonstrate universality and severity, and seek a per-sample efficiency solution.

Method: Formalize and quantify the overscaling curse; analyze its trigger; propose T2, a lightweight method that leverages latent representations to estimate per-sample optimal parallelism level before decoding; validate with experiments.

Result: T2 significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining comparable performance across tasks, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

Conclusion: The overscaling curse is universal and harmful; T2 provides an effective, low-cost remedy by tailoring parallelism to individual samples, improving overall efficiency of parallel thinking in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive mixed-precision strategy for transformer inference that selectively recomputes parts of intermediate results to improve accuracy with minimal recomputation, demonstrated on GPT-2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce numerical error in mixed-precision transformer inference for compositionally rich functions, while preserving efficiency.

Method: Perform rounding-error analysis of f(g(x)); develop an adaptive strategy that computes a subset of g(x) components at higher precision while others use lower precision; apply to various inner components of a transformer and analyze the impact; validate with GPT-2 models.

Result: Small recomputation rates yield substantial accuracy gains, with up to two orders of magnitude improvement in some cases, demonstrating meaningful accuracy/efficiency trade-offs in transformer inference.

Conclusion: Adaptive selective recomputation in mixed-precision transformer inference is effective in balancing precision and performance, enabling more accurate models with modest overhead.

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

TL;DR: A survey framework for causal attribution of training-history effects in deep learning, introducing estimands, perturbations, and audit artifacts to enable portable measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the non-memoryless nature of modern training and the complex dependencies on optimizers, data order, and auxiliary state, enabling principled attribution of training history effects.

Method: Develops a taxonomy by source, lifetime, and visibility; defines seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and an audit-artifact reporting checklist.

Result: A structured framework/protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement of how training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

Conclusion: Concludes with a protocol enabling portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement of training-history influence, fostering comparability across models, data, and regimes.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

### [306] [Sampling-Free Privacy Accounting for Matrix Mechanisms under Random Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21636)
*Jan Schuchardt,Nikita Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops sampling-free, DP-compliant bounds for privacy amplification in DP matrix factorization under balls-in-bins allocation, using Rényi divergence and conditional composition; offers dynamic-programming-based bounds for efficiency and stronger small-ε guarantees, applicable to both banded and non-banded matrices; demonstrated via numerical experiments against Monte Carlo sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational and probabilistic limitations of sampling-based amplification estimates (which may require high-probability guarantees or abstention; sample complexity scales with 1/δ) and provide deterministic, scalable bounds for a broad class of matrix mechanisms.

Method: Introduce sampling-free bounds via Rényi divergence (dynamic programming to compute) and conditional composition; apply to arbitrary (banded/non-banded) matrices; compare numerically to existing Monte Carlo-based amplification in ball-in-bins setting.

Result: Dynamic-programming yields efficient computation of Rényi-divergence-based bounds; conditional-composition bounds give tighter privacy for small ε; bounds hold deterministically, no sampling error; performance demonstrated across various matrix mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling-free, Rényi-based and conditional-composition framework provides practical, scalable privacy amplification guarantees for DP matrix factorization under random allocation, with broad applicability and improved guarantees for small ε, complementing existing Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

*Patrick Kruger,Rafael Diaz,Simon Hauschulz,Stefan Harries,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenAI-driven propeller design via conditional flow matching that links design parameters with performance-conditioned noise to generate multiple valid geometries for the same targets; data generated with vortex lattice method and augmented with pseudo-labels from forward surrogates; demonstrates design diversity and data-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond forward ML (predict performance from design) to generative design that can produce varied propeller geometries meeting specified performance targets, addressing design exploration and data efficiency.

Method: Train a conditional flow model with bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated-noise conditioned on performance labels. Generate data via vortex lattice method simulations. Assess accuracy vs training data amount. Employ data augmentation using pseudo-labels from less data-intensive forward surrogate models to boost performance.

Result: The approach yields multiple distinct propeller geometries achieving similar performance targets. It reveals a trade-off between model accuracy and data availability. Pseudo-label augmentation improves overall model performance.

Conclusion: GenAI-based design enables versatile generation of geometries for fixed performance goals and can reduce data requirements. Future work could include physical validation, manufacturability constraints, and extension to broader operating conditions and propeller classes.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for ship propeller design. While traditional forward machine learning models predict the performance of mechanical components based on given design parameters, GenAI models aim to generate designs that achieve specified performance targets. In particular, we employ conditional flow matching to establish a bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated noise that is conditioned on performance labels. This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.
  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design.

*Evandro S. Ortigossa,Eran Segal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Segment-level MoE routing for time-series Transformers yields state-of-the-art forecasting on multivariate long-term benchmarks, outperforming both dense Transformers and token-wise MoE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-wise Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches for time-series forecasting may not leverage the natural locality and continuity of temporal data, limiting scalability and accuracy. A routing mechanism aligned with temporal structure could improve modeling efficiency and performance.

Method: Introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than independent tokens. Each expert models intra-segment interactions. Integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate on multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks with ablations.

Result: Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all horizons, outperforming dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Segment-level routing is validated by comprehensive ablations as the key performance driver.

Conclusion: Aligning MoE routing granularity with the intrinsic structure of time series provides a strong inductive bias and a promising direction for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

### [309] [Identifiable Equivariant Networks are Layerwise Equivariant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21645)
*Vahid Shahverdi,Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Georg Bökman,Kathlén Kohn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: If an end-to-end network is equivariant to input/output group actions, there exists a parameter setting that preserves the same end-to-end map while rendering the layers equivariant on latent spaces, assuming parameter identifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why end-to-end equivariance implies layerwise equivariance and account for the empirical emergence of symmetric weights, in a general, architecture-agnostic framework.

Method: Abstract group-action formalism; proves existence of a reparameterization yielding layerwise equivariance while preserving the end-to-end function; relies on identifiability of parameters, which holds for many networks and is conjectured for others.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of a parameter configuration with layerwise equivariance achieving the same end-to-end function; applicability is broad due to identified-parameter results; theory is architecture-agnostic.

Conclusion: Provides a mathematical explanation for the observed emergence of equivariant weight structures during training and clarifies how end-to-end and layerwise equivariances relate under identifiability.

Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.

### [310] [SWE-Spot: Building Small Repo-Experts with Repository-Centric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21649)
*Jinjun Peng,Magnus Saebo,Tianjun Zhong,Yi-Jie Cheng,Junfeng Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Simin Chen,Yangruibo Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) reframes training for open-weight SLMs by prioritizing vertical repo depth over horizontal task breadth. It internalizes the physics of a target software environment through parametric knowledge, producing repo-specialized experts (SWE-Spot-4B) that outperform larger open-weight models and some efficiency-focused commercial models on SWE tasks, with better sample efficiency and lower inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Task-Centric Learning (TCL) aggregates experiences across many repositories but fails to generalize well to unfamiliar codebases in resource-constrained settings. There is a demand for capable, privacy-preserving open-weight SLMs that can internalize a software environment rather than rely on costly inference-time search.

Method: Propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) as a paradigm shift. Develop four-unit Repository-Centric Experience to convert static codebases into interactive learning signals. Train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of repo-specialized experts, and evaluate against larger open-weight models (e.g., CWM, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

Result: SWE-Spot-4B and its repo-specialized variants break established scaling trends, outperforming larger open-weight models and matching or surpassing efficiency-focused commercial models on SWE tasks. They exhibit higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability. RCL demonstrates that internalizing the software environment (its 'physics') via parametric knowledge can yield efficient, scalable intelligence beyond traditional task breadth.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

### [311] [Gauge-invariant representation holonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21653)
*Vasileios Sevetlidis,George Pavlidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Represents a gauge-invariant measure of path-dependent geometry in neural representations, called representation holonomy, capturing the twist accumulated around input loops to reveal curvature beyond pointwise similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity measures (e.g., CKA, SVCCA) compare pointwise activation overlap but miss how representations change along input paths. This can hide meaningful differences in robustness and generalization.

Method: Define holonomy via parallel transport around small loops in input space. Fix gauge with global whitening, align neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, then embed results back into the full feature space. Prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations; derive a linear null for affine layers; show holonomy vanishes at small radii.

Result: Holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. Tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize.

Conclusion: Representation holonomy provides a practical, scalable diagnostic of the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity, complementing existing measures like CKA/SVCCA.

Abstract: Deep networks learn internal representations whose geometry--how features bend, rotate, and evolve--affects both generalization and robustness. Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the "twist" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity.

*Tianqi Zhao,Guanyang Wang,Yan Shuo Tan,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabClustPFN uses prior-fitted networks to perform amortized Bayesian clustering on tabular data, predicting both cluster assignments and the number of clusters in one forward pass, with heterogeneous features and no dataset-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering tabular data is challenging due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets; extending PFNs from supervised to unsupervised clustering requires handling permutation-invariant outputs and unknown cluster counts.

Method: Pretrain TabClustPFN on synthetic data drawn from a flexible clustering prior; perform amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality; single forward-pass inference on unseen datasets without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning; designed to handle mixed numerical and categorical features and varying clustering structures.

Result: TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines on synthetic and curated real-world tabular benchmarks; exhibits robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings; code is released.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of applying the PFN paradigm to unsupervised clustering on tabular data, enabling generalization to diverse clusterings and feature types without per-dataset tuning, and motivating further exploration and deployment.

Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

TL;DR: REPVLM models embedding density on a hypersphere via Riemannian Flow Matching to quantify epistemic uncertainty in VLMs; reports strong correlation with error and utility for OOD/data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic vision-language models lack principled, intrinsic uncertainty estimates. A density-based proxy on the embedding manifold captures model ignorance and supports reliable OOD detection and data curation.

Method: Learn a density estimator on the VLM embedding hypersphere using Riemannian Flow Matching; use negative log-density as the epistemic uncertainty score; evaluate correlation with error and applicability to OOD detection and automated data curation.

Result: Experiments show near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, outperforming baselines; demonstrates scalable uncertainty for OOD detection and data curation.

Conclusion: Embedding-density on a hyperspherical manifold via REPVLM provides a principled, scalable approach to epistemic uncertainty for VLMs with practical benefits in deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

*Xingyue Zhang,Yuxuan Bao,Mars Liyao Gao,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SENDAI is a hierarchical data assimilation framework that reconstructs full spatial fields from ultra-sparse observations by fusing simulation priors with learned discrepancy corrections, achieving large SSIM gains over baselines in MODIS vegetation-index reconstruction under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between data-rich training and observation-sparse deployment in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, especially under distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics, requiring effective sparse-measurement reconstruction that preserves diagnostics and supports real-time use.

Method: Hierarchical Sparse-measurement Efficient Data Assimilation (SENDAI) that combines simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections to reconstruct full spatial states from hyper-sparse sensor observations; validated on satellite remote sensing (MODIS vegetation indices) across six globally distributed sites, using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift.

Result: SENDAI consistently outperforms baselines requiring denser observations, with up to 185% SSIM improvement over traditional baselines and 36% over high-frequency-based methods; gains are strongest for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; reconstructed fields preserve field topology, land-cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients; corrections are structurally and spectrally separable, aiding downstream inference; framework appears lightweight and operational for resource-limited deployment and real-time monitoring.

Conclusion: SENDAI offers a practically viable sparse-measurement reconstruction framework that leverages physics priors and data-driven corrections to enable reliable, structure-preserving full-field reconstructions under domain shift, suitable for physically grounded inference and real-time applications; future work could explore generalization, uncertainty, and applicability to other sensors and variables.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

### [315] [Expected Return Causes Outcome-Level Mode Collapse in Reinforcement Learning and How to Fix It with Inverse Probability Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21669)
*Abhijeet Sinha,Sundari Elango,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Expected-return objective causes outcome-level mode collapse in multimodal RL; inverse probability scaling (IPS) in GRPO (IPS-GRPO) mitigates collapse and preserves or improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to achieve diverse high-quality outcomes; collapse under standard objective is structural, not just exploration issue.

Method: The authors analyze idealized learning dynamics showing log-probability ratio between outcomes evolves linearly with reward difference; identify probability multiplier inside expectation as source; introduce inverse probability scaling; implement as GRPO variant IPS-GRPO; treat as drop-in modification.

Result: IPS-GRPO reduces outcome-level mode collapse across reasoning and molecular generation tasks; matches or surpasses baselines.

Conclusion: Correcting the objective is key to multimodal policy optimization; IPS-GRPO provides a simple, model-agnostic fix that improves diversity without harming performance.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generalizable spatio-temporal fluid dynamics predictor (LLM4Fluid) that uses physics-informed reduced-order modeling to compress flow fields, an LLM to autoregressively predict dynamics, and a modality-alignment bridge to enable zero-shot and in-context learning without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based spatio-temporal modeling in fluids struggles with unseen flow conditions and often requires retraining; leveraging LLMs as general solvers can enhance generalization and data efficiency.

Method: Compress high-dimensional flow fields into latent space via physics-informed disentanglement; use pretrained LLM as temporal processor with time-series prompts; introduce modality alignment to mitigate prompt-physical sequence mismatch; autoregressive predictions; extensive experiments showing robustness and generalization.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy across diverse flows; strong generalization to unseen conditions without retraining; notable zero-shot and in-context learning benefits; public code and datasets.

Conclusion: LLM4Fluid demonstrates a generalizable, non-retraining neural solver for fluid dynamics, highlighting the viability of LLMs for physics-based sequence prediction and cross-modality bridging; potential for broad application in computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/qisongxiao/LLM4Fluid.

*Wu S. Zihan,Ariane Delrocq,Wulfram Gerstner,Guillaume Bellec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Local-SSL rules can emulate global backpropagation (BP-SSL) under specific conditions in deep linear networks; new local-SSL variants extend this to deep nonlinear CNNs, improving gradient alignment and achieving competitive performance. The best CLAPP-based local rule matches global BP-SSL with InfoNCE/CPC examples and surpasses prior local SSL on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the performance and theoretical gap between local self-supervised learning (SL) and end-to-end global backpropagation (BP-SSL); establish conditions under which local rules can implement BP-SSL updates, and adapt them to non-linear networks to achieve competitive results.

Method: 1) Theoretical analysis of deep linear networks to derive conditions where local-SSL algorithms (e.g., Forward-forward, CLAPP) implement identical weight updates to global BP-SSL. 2) Develop novel local-SSL variants inspired by these insights to approximate BP-SSL in deep non-linear CNNs. 3) Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet comparing gradient update similarity and downstream performance with InfoNCE/CPC-like losses.

Result: Found conditions under which local-SSL updates coincide with BP-SSL in deep linear networks. Proposed local-SSL variants yield higher gradient similarity to BP-SSL in CNNs and improved performance on CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet. The best CLAPP-based local rule with CLAPP loss matches the performance of comparable global BP-SSL setups using InfoNCE or CPC-like losses and outperforms previous state-of-the-art local SSL on these benchmarks.

Conclusion: Local-SSL can reach parity with global BP-SSL under appropriate conditions, and informed design of local learning rules enables effective deep learning in CNNs with competitive or superior performance to traditional global SSL methods, while enhancing locality of the learning process.

Abstract: While end-to-end self-supervised learning with backpropagation (global BP-SSL) has become central for training modern AI systems, theories of local self-supervised learning (local-SSL) have struggled to build functional representations in deep neural networks. To establish a link between global and local rules, we first develop a theory for deep linear networks: we identify conditions for local-SSL algorithms (like Forward-forward or CLAPP) to implement exactly the same weight update as a global BP-SSL. Starting from the theoretical insights, we then develop novel variants of local-SSL algorithms to approximate global BP-SSL in deep non-linear convolutional neural networks. Variants that improve the similarity between gradient updates of local-SSL with those of global BP-SSL also show better performance on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet). The best local-SSL rule with the CLAPP loss function matches the performance of a comparable global BP-SSL with InfoNCE or CPC-like loss functions, and improves upon state-of-the-art for local SSL on these benchmarks.

### [318] [Don't be so Stief! Learning KV Cache low-rank approximation over the Stiefel manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21686)
*Luca Benfenati,Matteo Risso,Andrea Vannozzi,Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Lukas Cavigelli,Enrico Macii,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Alessio Burrello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StiefAttention learns orthonormal projection bases for KV-cache compression by directly minimizing decoder-layer output reconstruction error, with per-layer error-rank profiles for flexible allocation under an error budget. On Llama3-8B with iso-compression, it outperforms EigenAttention by 11.9 points in C4 perplexity and by 5.4% in 0-shot MMLU accuracy, with lower reconstruction error and higher cosine similarity to original outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching accelerates autoregressive decoding but long contexts strain HBM capacity and bandwidth. Existing post-training projections often rely on SVD-style proxies that may poorly reflect end-to-end decoder behavior, especially after softmax and value mixing.

Method: Learn per-layer orthonormal projection bases by directly minimizing the end-to-end decoder-layer output reconstruction error. Precompute, for each layer, an error–rank profile over candidate ranks to enable flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Compare to EigenAttention on Llama3-8B under iso-compression.

Result: Under iso-compression on Llama3-8B, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention, achieving an 11.9-point improvement in C4 perplexity and a 5.4% gain in 0-shot MMLU accuracy, along with lower relative reconstruction error and higher cosine similarity to the original decoder-layer outputs.

Conclusion: End-to-end reconstruction-focused, orthonormal KV-cache compression with layer-aware rank profiling yields meaningful gains over SVD-based proxies, validating the effectiveness of StiefAttention for large LLMs.

Abstract: Key--value (KV) caching enables fast autoregressive decoding but at long contexts becomes a dominant bottleneck in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth. A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.
  For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs.

### [319] [XFACTORS: Disentangled Information Bottleneck via Contrastive Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21688)
*Alexandre Myara,Nicolas Bourriez,Thomas Boyer,Thomas Lemercier,Ihab Bendidi,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XFactors is a weakly-supervised VAE that disentangles factors by partitioning latent space into a residual S and factor-specific T_i subspaces, using InfoNCE supervision and KL regularization to achieve state-of-the-art disentanglement and controllable factor swapping without adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised methods struggle to recover semantic factors on real data; supervised approaches rely on adversarial objectives or classifiers and scale poorly to large attribute sets; a scalable, weakly-supervised approach with explicit factor control is needed.

Method: Disentangled Information Bottleneck decomposition of the latent representation into a residual subspace S and factor-specific subspaces T_1,...,T_K. Each target factor is encoded in its T_i via contrastive supervision with an InfoNCE loss that pulls latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatches. KL regularization imposes Gaussian structure on S and the aggregated T_i to organize the geometry for non-target factors without extra supervision and without adversarial training.

Result: XFactors achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores across multiple datasets with constant hyperparameters, shows consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enables controlled factor swapping via latent replacement, and scales with increasing latent capacity; demonstrated on CelebA.

Conclusion: A weakly-supervised, stable, scalable disentanglement framework that provides explicit control over target factors without adversarial training, with practical performance on real-world data.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}{github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}.

### [320] [Understanding Model Merging: A Unified Generalization Framework for Heterogeneous Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21690)
*Qinglun Li,Anke Tang,Miao Zhang,Mengzhu Wang,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical, L2-stability-based framework explains model merging under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters, providing a unified theory and actionable guidance, validated on ResNet/ViT across many finetuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of a unified theory for merging effectiveness under heterogeneous hyperparameters and lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models hinder predictions of merged-model performance.

Method: Apply L2-stability theory in heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to bound and analyze the generalization of the merged parameter x_avg, deriving a framework that explains existing merging algorithms and identifies optimization targets within the bound.

Result: A unified theoretical framework that explains how existing merging algorithms optimize particular bound terms, plus actionable recommendations for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models; extensive experiments on ResNet/ViT across ~20/8 tasks with thousands of finetuned models validate the theory and show hyperparameters influence the generalization of x_avg as predicted.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational theory for model merging under heterogeneous finetuning, guiding practitioners to construct merge-friendly models through informed hyperparameter choices in the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline.

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

### [321] [Curriculum Learning for LLM Pretraining: An Analysis of Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21698)
*Mohamed Elgaar,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning stabilizes within-phase optimization during pretraining, with gains largest for small models and diminishing with scale; it mainly changes data exposure within existing phases rather than creating new phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether linguistically motivated curricula alter the learning trajectory or simply reorder exposure within a fixed trajectory during large-scale pretraining.

Method: Train Pythia models (14M–410M params) for 300B tokens under three curricula (Age-of-Acquisition, Word Frequency, Verb Variation) and compare to Random; at 1B params compare Random and VV; assess gradient noise, output-head spectral saturation, final accuracy; formalize with gradient-variance control.

Result: Across orderings, training follows a shared latent phase sequence; curricula mainly shift data exposure within phases. Smaller models (≤160M) show higher gradient noise and stronger late-training spectral saturation with Random, curricula mitigate both; larger scales show smaller saturation differences and reduced gains. An idealized gradient-variance analysis links difficulty pacing to optimization stability.

Conclusion: Curricula improve optimization stability within phases rather than creating new phases, with practical benefit for smaller models that wanes at larger scales.

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

### [322] [Beyond Forgetting: Machine Unlearning Elicits Controllable Side Behaviors and Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21702)
*Tien Dang,The-Hai Nguyen,Dinh Mai Phuong,Nguyen Minh Phuong,Hoang Thanh-Tung,Le-Minh Nguyen,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes representation misdirection (RM) through the linear representation hypothesis; reveals a 1D concept vector in forget representations that supports linear manipulation, enabling controllable side effects and potential capability enhancements, with dual risk and benefit implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the role of target vectors in RM and investigate whether unlearning induces predictable, controllable off-target behaviors and abilities, not merely forgetting.

Method: Adopt the linear representation hypothesis; identify a one-dimensional representation associated with a high-level concept within forget representations; apply linear operations on this vector; validate experimentally across behavioral control tasks (truth, sentiment, refusals) and capability improvement (in-context learning).

Result: RM can induce controllable side behaviors and enhanced capabilities; empirical results show manipulation of high-level attributes and improved in-context learning, underscoring both risk and opportunity.

Conclusion: RM represents a double-edged mechanism: a potential risk if misused but also a tool to develop models with stronger, controllable capabilities; warrants careful governance and further research.

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

### [323] [SmartMeterFM: Unifying Smart Meter Data Generative Tasks Using Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21706)
*Nan Lin,Yanbo Wang,Jacco Heres,Peter Palensky,Pedro P. Vergara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, conditional generative model based on flow matching for smart meter data tasks. It handles imputation, super-resolution, and synthetic data with a single model by treating tasks as partial observations injected into generation, yielding realistic, observation-consistent high-dimensional time-series data and outperforming task-specific baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and data quality issues limit access to smart meter data. A single, efficient model to perform multiple generative tasks without retraining is desirable.

Method: Employ flow-matching conditional generative models trained to produce high-dimensional time-series data (monthly data at 15-minute resolution). Different tasks are treated as partial observations; these observations are injected into the generation process, enabling imputation, super-resolution, and synthetic data generation within one model without retraining.

Result: The generated data are consistent with the given observations and remain realistic, showing superior performance compared with interpolation and other ML baselines tailored to individual tasks.

Conclusion: A conditional flow-matching framework can unify diverse smart meter data generation tasks under a single model, reducing redundancy and training effort while delivering high-quality data.

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

TL;DR: PIDMs trade prediction bias for reduced IDM variance, yielding improved data efficiency over BC under certain predictor bias conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why predictive inverse dynamics models can outperform behavioral cloning and quantify the bias-variance mechanism; bridge theory and practice.

Method: Theoretical bias-variance analysis of PIDM; derive conditions on state predictor bias for lower error and higher sample efficiency; empirical validation in 2D navigation and 3D visual environment.

Result: PIDM reduces variance by conditioning IDM on predicted future state, with bias from the predictor; under sufficient bias balance, PIDM achieves lower error and higher sample efficiency than BC; additional data sources amplify the advantage; empirical results show BC needs up to 5x more demonstrations in 2D (3x average) and >66% more samples in 3D game.

Conclusion: PIDM's bias-variance tradeoff explains empirical gains and offers guidance on predictor bias levels; leveraging data sources can further widen the gap; supports PIDM as a theoretically grounded improvement over BC.

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

### [325] [LoRA and Privacy: When Random Projections Help (and When They Don't)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21719)
*Yaxi Hu,Johanna Düngler,Bernhard Schölkopf,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wishart-based projection can ensure non-additive DP for vector-valued queries without extra noise, but not for matrix-valued queries in the noise-free setting. Adding noise yields privacy amplification via randomness and low-rank projections; LoRA updates map to this mechanism yet are not inherently private, though low-rank fine-tuning can be more privacy-preserving than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments show tighter accounting improves accuracy with DP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate a randomized Wishart projection mechanism as a potentially noise-efficient DP tool, evaluating its privacy guarantees for vector- versus matrix-valued queries and its relation to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA).

Method: Define the mechanism S ↦ M f(S) with M drawn from a Wishart distribution W_d(1/r I_d, r). Derive non-asymptotic DP guarantees for vector-valued queries without additive noise. Show a sharp negative result for matrix-valued queries in the noise-free setting via a near-perfect membership inference attack. Introduce a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low-rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes. Connect LoRA-style updates to this mechanism and discuss privacy implications. Present preliminary experiments suggesting improved accuracy with tighter DP accounting at fixed noise.

Result: Vector-valued queries can be differentially private without extra noise under the Wishart projection mechanism. Matrix-valued queries are not DP in the noise-free setting, evidenced by a near-perfect membership inference attack. Introducing noise yields privacy amplification through the randomness of the Wishart draw and low-rank structure, with stronger guarantees in both high- and low-rank regimes. LoRA updates can be viewed as instances of the matrix-valued mechanism; however, LoRA is not inherently private, though low-rank fine-tuning may offer privacy advantages over full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments indicate that tighter DP accounting can enable lower noise and better accuracy in practice.

Conclusion: Wishart-based projections offer a promising DP tool for vector-valued workloads without additive noise but face limitations for matrix-valued queries unless noise is deployed. The framework highlights the role of randomness and rank in privacy amplification and connects to practical parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA), suggesting that low-rank strategies can enhance privacy-utility trade-offs under differential privacy constraints.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

*Kaustubh Sharma,Srijan Tiwari,Ojasva Nema,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable spectral discovery for Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) by decoding attention latents into explicit spectral densities and stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem, enabling fast GP-compatible inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFNs provide amortized inference but hide priors/kernels, limiting downstream tasks that require explicit covariance models; transparent, identifiable priors are desired.

Method: Mechanistic analysis shows attention latent outputs as the key intermediary; design decoders that map PFN latents to spectral densities and kernels using Bochner's theorem; study single- and multi-realization regimes; establish identifiability limits and consistency with multiple samples.

Result: Decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels. GP regression with these kernels achieves accuracy comparable to PFNs and baselines, with substantially faster inference (single forward pass) than optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: An interpretable, efficient path from PFN latents to explicit spectral models enables transparent priors/kernels for downstream GP-based tasks, maintaining performance while dramatically reducing inference time.

Abstract: Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) enable efficient amortized inference but lack transparent access to their learned priors and kernels. This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mixed-precision training/compilation framework for CIM accelerators using reinforcement learning to search quantization settings, reducing MVM latency. Best case yields up to 2.48x speedup with 0.086% accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIM accelerators operate on crossbar arrays with very limited bit-width for inputs and cells; many CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8-bit, leading to many compute cycles and inefficient weight storage. A flexible, sub-8-bit quantization strategy is needed to improve latency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Proposes a mixed-precision training and compilation framework augmented with a reinforcement learning-based strategy to explore the massive quantization search space and optimize configurations that trade off latency and accuracy.

Result: The approach achieves up to 2.48x speedup over state-of-the-art solutions with an accuracy loss of 0.086%.

Conclusion: An RL-guided mixed-precision approach effectively reduces CIM latency while preserving accuracy, enabling more efficient CIM compiler design and expanding viable sub-8-bit quantization for MVM on crossbar arrays.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

*Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Jose I. Mestre,Manuel F. Dolz,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam is first-order gradient scale invariant if and only if β1=β2, explaining empirical gains and guiding future optimizer design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirically, validating scores and training dynamics improve when β1=β2; there is no established explanation for this pattern. The work identifies gradient scale invariance as a unifying principle underlying robust updates.

Method: Formalize gradient scale invariance and prove that Adam achieves first-order gradient scale invariance precisely when β1=β2. Support theory with experiments across vision and language tasks and diverse architectures, showing smoother behavior under gradient rescaling when β1=β2 and alignment with other scale-robust optimizers.

Result: Theoretical claim: first-order gradient scale invariance holds iff β1=β2. Empirical results across multiple domains corroborate that rescaling gradients has a smoother effect on Adam updates under β1=β2, and that this regime aligns with recent scale-robust optimizers.

Conclusion: The work provides a coherent explanation for Adam’s behavior and presents a simple design principle for future optimizers based on gradient-scale invariance.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A relational, propositionalised approach to sepsis prediction from temporal EMR data, yielding highly interpretable features and a fourfold interpretation (univariate, global, local, counterfactual) via a selective Naive Bayes classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackling the lack of interpretability and neglected latent sub-phenotypes in deep learning approaches for sepsis prediction by converting longitudinal EMR data into an interpretable relational representation and using propositionalisation to produce flat, meaningful features.

Method: Model EMR time-series as multivariate relational data; apply propositionalisation with classic aggregation/selection functions to construct flat, interpretable features; classify with a selective Naive Bayes classifier; provide fourfold interpretability (univariate, global, local, counterfactual).

Result: Experimental validation indicates that the approach is relevant and offers extreme interpretability, enabling fourfold explanations; performance is competitive with baseline methods while prioritizing interpretability.

Conclusion: A relational, propositionalisation-based framework can enhance interpretability in sepsis prediction and reveal latent sub-phenotypes through structured, flat features, with fourfold interpretability and efficient probabilistic classification.

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified differentiable framework for knapsack/top-k operators via dynamic programming, with differentiable relaxations, efficient parallel forward/backward passes, and theoretical characterizations of regularizers; validated on decision-focused learning, dynamic assortment RL, and discrete VAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knapsack and top-k are powerful for discrete subset selection but are non-differentiable and piecewise constant, hindering gradient-based learning; need differentiable approximations and scalable algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Method: Cast the operators as dynamic programs; derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing recursions; develop parallel algorithms for deterministic and stochastic forward passes; provide vector-Jacobian products for backpropagation; prove entropy is the unique permutation-equivariant regularizer and characterize sparse-inducing regularizers.

Result: Empirical demonstration on decision-focused learning benchmarks, constrained dynamic assortment RL, and extensions of discrete VAEs, showing effective integration of these operators with neural models and the benefits of the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Presents a unified DP-based differentiable framework for knapsack/top-k operators, with novel algorithmic and theoretical contributions and broad empirical validation across tasks.

Abstract: Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular, architecture-agnostic framework (Quantum LEGO Learning) for hybrid quantum-classical models using frozen classical feature blocks and trainable quantum heads, with block-wise generalization theory and empirical validation on quantum dot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited generality and transferability in existing tightly coupled hybrid models by decoupling classical and quantum components into reusable building blocks, enabling efficient learning with constrained quantum resources and enabling principled analysis.

Method: Treat components as reusable blocks: a pre-trained classical neural network as a frozen feature extractor and a variational quantum circuit as the trainable adaptive head operating on structured representations. Develop block-wise generalization theory decomposing error into approximation and estimation terms, generalizing tensor-network results. Conduct block-swap experiments across different feature extractors and heads, and validate on quantum dot classification with attention to optimization stability and noise robustness.

Result: Demonstrated stable optimization and reduced sensitivity to qubit count; observed robustness to realistic noise; identified conditions where quantum modules offer representational advantages over similarly sized classical heads; block-swap experiments validate modular framework.

Conclusion: A modular, architecture-agnostic hybrid learning framework enabling principled analysis and transferability of quantum-classical models, with theoretical decomposition of errors and empirical evidence of practical benefits under resource constraints.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

TL;DR: ECSEL learns compact signomial expressions as interpretable classifiers, achieving competitive accuracy with efficient computation and providing explanations via closed-form, global/local explanations and bias/counterfactual insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression benchmarks indicate many problems admit compact signomial structure; there is a need for models that are interpretable, globally well-behaved, and able to expose biases and counterfactuals, while maintaining accuracy.

Method: ECSEL directly constructs a closed-form signomial expression that serves as both classifier and explanation; emphasizes structure discovery and interpretability; demonstrates efficiency by recovering target equations with less computation; evaluates on benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Result: Outperforms competing symbolic regression methods in recovering target equations; achieves classification accuracy competitive with standard ML models; exhibits desirable properties for global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local attributions; real-world case studies reveal dataset biases and support counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: ECSEL provides an interpretable, efficient classifier that matches or surpasses baselines in accuracy while offering explainability and bias/causality insights; suitable for applications requiring transparent decision-making.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

Conclusion: As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ enables efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

*Yejin Kim,Dongjun Hwang,Sungmin Cha,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVW is a training-free unlearning method for LVLMs that weakens knowledge vectors activated during the forget set, enabling efficient removal of undesirable knowledge without gradient updates and achieving a stable forget-retain trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy leakage and harmful content risks in large vision-language models while avoiding the high computational cost of gradient-based unlearning.

Method: Identify activations of knowledge vectors during output generation on the forget set and progressively weaken their contributions without performing gradient-based optimization.

Result: KVW delivers a stable forget-retain balance and substantially reduces computation compared to gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: Training-free KVW offers an effective and scalable alternative for data unlearning in LVLMs, enabling practical removal of undesirable knowledge with lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

### [335] [Effective LoRA Adapter Routing using Task Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21795)
*Akash Dhasade,Anne-Marie Kermarrec,Igor Pavlovic,Diana Petrescu,Rafael Pires,Mathis Randl,Martijn de Vos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LORAUTER uses task-level representations to route and compose LoRA adapters for LLMs, enabling scalable, data-efficient adapter selection with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With large public LoRA adapter pools, routing becomes a bottleneck. Existing query-to-adapter mappings scale poorly with the number of adapters and often require adapter-specific data. A task-centric routing approach promises scalability with the number of tasks and data efficiency.

Method: The framework derives task embeddings from small validation sets and routes queries via these task representations to select and compose LoRA adapters. It operates at the task level, does not require adapter training data, and scales with the number of tasks rather than adapters, handling very large adapter pools.

Result: LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing methods, matches Oracle performance when task-aligned adapters exist, achieves state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points), and remains robust when scaling to over 1500 adapters.

Conclusion: Task-level routing with task embeddings is effective for modular LoRA adapter pools, offering scalable, data-efficient, and robust adapter routing that generalizes to unseen tasks and large, noisy pools.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nonparametric DMLEval framework for ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased ML, introducing GARS to handle complex human responses (including ties) with efficient estimation and compatibility with black-box estimators and LLM evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of parametric models and lack of valid uncertainty quantification in LLM ranking from human preferences; need flexible, data-efficient methods.

Method: Debiased machine learning (DML) framework; generalized average ranking scores (GARS) that extend Bradley–Terry and centrality models; accommodates ties; integrates black-box estimators and LLM-based evaluators; provides data collection policies under budget.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world preference data showing efficiency and robustness; practical guidance for practitioners.

Conclusion: DMLEval offers a principled, scalable, nonparametric toolkit for comparing or ranking LLMs from preference data with valid uncertainty quantification and flexible estimation options.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

### [337] [DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824)
*Xinwei Qiang,Hongmin Chen,Shixuan Sun,Jingwen Leng,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deterministic attention in LLM training incurs substantial throughput cost; we model the deterministic backward pass as a DAG scheduling problem and introduce DASH (Descending Q-Tile Iteration and Shift Scheduling) to minimize the critical path, reducing pipeline stalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure reproducibility in LLM training via deterministic backward passes, which currently cause significant slowdowns (up to ~38% in deterministic backward pass for attention).

Method: Model the deterministic attention backward pass as a DAG scheduling problem and derive two scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration (reversed query-block traversal to cut pipeline stalls in causal attention), and (ii) Shift Scheduling (theoretically optimal within the DAG model for both full and causal masks). Implement DASH and evaluate on NVIDIA H800 GPUs.

Result: DASH improves throughput of the deterministic attention backward pass by up to 1.28x over the baseline, narrowing the gap between deterministic and non-deterministic attention; code is open-sourced.

Conclusion: DASH effectively reduces deterministic backward-pass stalls in attention, advancing reproducible LLM training by delivering higher throughput and providing practical scheduling strategies.

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

*Jigar Parekh,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An active-learning framework for field-predicting ML models using a scalar GP reference; reduces epistemic error and scalar-field discrepancy; demonstrates efficiency on NASA CR model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend active learning from scalar outputs to field predictions; reduce costly CFD simulations by selecting informative samples; architecture-agnostic approach.

Method: Hybrid strategy: use Gaussian process for scalar reference; jointly minimize scalar infill uncertainty and field-pidelity error; introduce variants; compare to scalar-only infill; apply to NASA CR model for uncertainty propagation.

Result: Achieves high accuracy with significantly lower sample count and computational cost than non-active-learning baseline; robust across variants in NASA CR model task.

Conclusion: Feasible and effective approach for active learning in field predictions; can generalize across architectures; promising for CFD-related uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable surrogate DNN to learn a kernel that emulates the NTK for the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA), enabling efficient predictive uncertainty for large pre-trained DNNs; achieves comparable or better calibration and improves out-of-distribution detection when the kernel is biased.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational burden of LLA by avoiding large Jacobian computations while maintaining or improving uncertainty estimates; explore kernel learning beyond the standard NTK within the LLA framework.

Method: Train a compact surrogate DNN to learn a feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Training uses efficient Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) rather than explicit large Jacobians, enabling uncertainty estimation on large-scale pre-trained networks.

Result: Experiments show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared with existing LLA approximations. Biasing the learned kernel enhances out-of-distribution detection, highlighting the potential of kernel learning to produce kernels superior to NTK in the LLA context for uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that learning task-specific kernels can surpass NTK in the LLA setting, offering scalable, accurate uncertainty estimation for large pre-trained DNNs.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-constrained learning in meta-RL, particularly for real-world tasks (robotics, healthcare), where ensuring safe behavior on test tasks while maintaining fast learning is crucial.

Method: Introduce a policy-refinement algorithm that builds on policies learned during training and provides provable safety guarantees and sample-complexity bounds for obtaining a near-optimal policy on test tasks; also derive a matching lower bound to show tightness of the bound.

Result: Demonstrates provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near-optimal policy on test tasks; upper bounds are matched by a lower bound, indicating tightness of the sample complexity.

Conclusion: Advances constrained meta-RL by delivering a Safety-certified refinement procedure with tight sample complexity guarantees, clarifying fundamental limits and ensuring practical applicability to safety-critical tasks.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward design bias and potential reward hacking in MetaBBO; automated, scalable reward discovery via LLM to improve robustness and performance.

Method: Introduce an evolution-based LLM program search loop to iteratively refine reward functions; implement a multi-task evolution framework enabling parallel reward discovery and cross-task knowledge sharing.

Result: Discovered reward functions improve the performance of existing MetaBBO methods; empirical evaluations demonstrate their usefulness; parallelisation accelerates reward discovery through knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: Automated reward design via LLMs is a promising direction for MetaBBO, addressing bias and efficiency; the paper highlights the value of reward design and provides a reusable READY resource.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiDAE integrates frozen foundation models with a disentangled dictionary learning approach to generate multiple, diverse, disentangled counterfactuals via a diffusion autoencoder, enabling gradient-free, efficient mitigation of spurious correlations. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (DiDAE-CFKD), it achieves state-of-the-art mitigation of shortcut learning on unbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but are vulnerable to spurious correlations and Clever Hans strategies. Existing mitigation methods often require unavailable group labels or expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. A gradient-free, interpretable method tailored to foundation models is needed.

Method: Construct and edit embeddings of a frozen foundation model along interpretable directions from a disentangled dictionary; decode edited embeddings through a diffusion autoencoder to generate multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual input; optionally combine with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) for improved robustness.

Result: The framework enables faster generation of multiple counterfactuals compared to baselines that produce single entangled counterfactuals; when paired with CFKD, DiDAE achieves state-of-the-art mitigation of shortcut learning and improves downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: DiDAE offers a gradient-free, efficient approach for producing diverse counterfactuals by leveraging disentangled representations and diffusion decoding within frozen foundation models, with CFKD further enhancing robustness against shortcut learning.

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

### [343] [MoHETS: Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21866)
*Evandro S. Ortigossa,Guy Lutsker,Eran Segal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MoHETS, a sparse mixture-of-heterogeneous-experts encoder for long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art with ~12% MSE improvement by leveraging heterogeneous experts, cross-attention for exogenous covariates, and a convolutional patch decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world MTS have multi-scale structure (global trends, local periodicities, non-stationary regimes) and require scalable, horizon-generalizable models. Homogeneous MLP MoEs struggle to capture diverse dynamics and long-horizon dependencies.

Method: Encoder-only Transformer with MoHE layers routing patches to a small subset of heterogeneous experts: a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity; routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures; cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings for exogenous info; convolutional patch decoder in place of heavy linear heads for efficiency and horizon-generalization.

Result: Evaluated on seven multivariate benchmarks across multiple horizons; MoHETS achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing average MSE by 12% vs strong baselines.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous expert specialization within MoHE layers enables robust long-term forecasting, improved parameter efficiency, training stability, and horizon-generalization, establishing a new strong baseline for long-horizon MTS.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

### [344] [Low-Rank Plus Sparse Matrix Transfer Learning under Growing Representations and Ambient Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21873)
*Jinhang Chai,Xuyuan Liu,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfers subspace knowledge from a source task to a growing target task, decomposing the target into an embedded source component, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits. An anchored alternating projection estimator preserves the transferred subspace while estimating limited low-dimensional changes. Theoretical error bounds separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, with improved rates for small rank/sparsity growth. Demonstrated on Markov transition matrices with dependent noise and on structured covariance under enlarged dimensions, with empirical transfer gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable transfer learning in settings where ambient dimensionality and intrinsic representation both grow, by leveraging a well-estimated source task embedded as a subspace to improve target estimation.

Method: An anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves the transferred subspace and estimates only low-dimensional innovations (low-rank) and sparse edits; the target parameter is decomposed into an embedded source component, low-rank innovations, and sparse modifications.

Result: Deterministic error bounds that decouple target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error; strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small. For Markov transition matrices, end-to-end guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance with enlarged dimensions, complementary analysis in the appendix and empirical validation of transfer gains.

Conclusion: A general transfer learning framework for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth, showing that preserving transferred subspaces while adapting only compact innovations yields provable gains; validated on two canonical problems demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

### [345] [Managing Solution Stability in Decision-Focused Learning with Cost Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21883)
*Victor Spitzer,Francois Sanson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Estimates objective coefficients via perturbation-based learning; shows instability from varying perturbation intensity; introduces regularization on cost vectors to stabilize learning; validated by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging prediction and combinatorial optimization requires differentiating through optimization; perturbation-based methods provide gradient signals but are sensitive to perturbation magnitude, hurting training stability and decision quality.

Method: Theoretically connect perturbation intensity fluctuations to solution stability; propose a regularization term on the estimated cost vector; integrate into the learning objective; evaluate on numerical experiments.

Result: Regularizing the estimated cost vectors improves robustness and reliability of the learning process; empirical results show better decision performance under perturbations.

Conclusion: Regularization of cost vectors is an effective remedy for instability in perturbation-based decision-focused learning; supports more robust integration of predictive modeling and optimization.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

*Lukas Twist,Shu Yang,Hanqi Yan,Jingzhi Gong,Di Wang,Helen Yannakoudakis,Jie M. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with code that has controlled structural complexity boosts reasoning more than training on arbitrary code; in most experiments, constraining to a target complexity range outperforms diverse-code training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify which code properties, specifically structural complexity (control flow and composition), contribute to improved multi-step reasoning in LLMs, beyond simple scaling and generic code exposure.

Method: Create datasets by measuring cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code; implement two regimes: solution-driven complexity (varying complexity across multiple solutions) and problem-driven complexity (varying complexity by task). Train/open-weight LLMs, evaluate on diverse reasoning benchmarks; compare complexity-controlled data vs structurally diverse data.

Result: Structural complexity strongly influences the usefulness of code; in 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a limited complexity range outperforms training on diverse code; demonstrates data-centric improvement path for reasoning.

Conclusion: Targeting code structure during fine-tuning offers a promising route to enhance reasoning beyond scaling; structural-aware data selection can be more effective than merely increasing data volume or diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaPP is a transferable, energy-efficient DL-based precoder for mMIMO that uses a teacher-student framework with meta-learning to generalize across sites, power levels, and channel estimation errors, achieving >21x energy savings and robust performance after light fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome computational cost and poor robustness of WMMSE and DL-based precoders; enable a single model to be deployed across multiple sites, power regimes, and varying channel estimation quality without retraining from scratch.

Method: Introduce PaPP, a plug-and-play DL framework with a high-capacity teacher and a compact student, trained with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate. Employ meta-learning for domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Supports both fully digital and hybrid beamforming, and is evaluated on ray-tracing data from unseen sites with fine-tuning on small unlabeled local data.

Result: PaPP FDP and HBF models outperform conventional and DL baselines after fine-tuning, with more than 21× reduction in modeled computation energy. Demonstrates robustness to channel-estimation errors and transferability across sites.

Conclusion: PaPP provides a practical, energy-efficient, transferable DL-based precoding solution for mMIMO, reducing retraining needs and maintaining performance across deployment variations.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global air quality forecasting suffers from spatial heterogeneity and poor generalization to unseen regions under existing transductive models.

Method: Encode invariant physical attributes into station identities and dynamically construct adaptive sparse topologies to capture long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion across uneven global networks; introduce WorldAir dataset with 7,800+ stations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines; about 10x faster than existing models; improves monitoring in data-sparse regions.

Conclusion: Semantic topology learning effectively enables scalable, generalizable global air quality forecasting; the WorldAir dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark and enables robust evaluation.

Abstract: Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hardware-induced numerical variations can be exploited to create hardware-triggered backdoors in ML models, enabling different predictions on different GPUs; demonstrated reliably and discussed defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify security risks when ML models are deployed across heterogeneous hardware where tiny numerical differences can be amplified to flip predictions, especially for third-party models.

Method: Shape the model's decision boundary near a target input; locally refine numerical deviations to flip predictions on selected hardware; validate the attack empirically across common GPU accelerators; explore defenses.

Result: Demonstrates reliable hardware-triggered backdoors across GPUs; establishes feasibility of this attack vector in real deployments; discusses countermeasures.

Conclusion: Hardware variability represents a credible backdoor risk in ML deployment; necessitates defenses such as cross-hardware validation and robust detection for third-party models.

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

### [350] [Optimistic Transfer under Task Shift via Bellman Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21924)
*Jinhang Chai,Enpei Zhang,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-step Bellman alignment with re-weighted targeting (RWT) enables transfer in online RL by correcting source Bellman updates via a change of measure; yields a two-stage Q-learning framework with regret guarantees under RKHS and empirical gains in tabular and neural setups, establishing Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring knowledge between related tasks in online, episodic RL is hindered because task similarity is often defined on rewards/transitions, while learning targets are Bellman-based; naive reuse causes bias and breaks regret guarantees.

Method: Introduce one-step Bellman alignment; develop RWT operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates transition mismatch via change of measure; a two-stage RWT Q-learning framework; theoretical regret bounds under RKHS; empirical tests in tabular and NN settings.

Result: RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction; regret bounds scale with task-shift complexity rather than target MDP; empirical results show consistent improvements over single-task learning and naive pooling.

Conclusion: Bellman alignment provides a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL, enabling statistically sound reuse of source data and improved performance across settings.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

*Shuangqi Li,Hieu Le,Jingyi Xu,Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRIF enables scalable gradient-based training data attribution by leveraging low-rank structures, reducing storage and memory while maintaining or improving attribution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two bottlenecks in gradient-based TDA: (i) I/O/storage of per-example projected gradients at scale; (ii) memory cost of D×D inverse Hessian; both scale with projection dimension D, hindering quality-scalability.

Method: Store rank-c factors of projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices; apply truncated SVD with Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an r-dimensional subspace; reductions in storage I/O to O(c sqrt(D)) per layer per sample and memory to O(Dr).

Result: LoRIF achieves up to 20× storage reduction and faster query time versus LoGRA; matches or exceeds attribution quality; scalable from 0.1B to 70B parameter models on million-scale datasets.

Conclusion: LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale by exploiting gradient low-rank structure, enabling efficient, high-quality attribution for large models and datasets.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality-scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-stream, causally-informed decorrelation framework for medical multimodal learning that disentangles causal features from biases, improving generalization across MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical multimodal data contain systemic biases from multiple sources that induce spurious correlations; existing fusion-focused methods fail to address these biases, hurting generalization. A method to separate causal features from biased correlations is needed.

Method: Introduce a model-agnostic dual-stream neural architecture that performs causal-bias decorrelation via structural causal analysis with latent confounders. The approach uses generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning pipelines.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI show consistent performance improvements over baselines, validating effective decorrelation of biases and better generalization.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical plug-in solution for robust medical multimodal learning under bias by leveraging latent confounder–driven causal decorrelation, with broad applicability across datasets and modalities.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

*Ahmad Aghapour,Erhan Bayraktar,Ziqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents a dimension-free convergence analysis for diffusion models via an information-theoretic KL bound, and introduces a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for discretizing reverse SDE based on training loss, which improves sampling quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses typically depend on ambient dimension or geometric assumptions about the target; the work seeks a dimension-free, assumption-light convergence framework.

Method: Develop an information-theoretic approach to bound KL(target || generated) by O(H^2/K) (H = Shannon entropy, K = sampling steps). Recast KL to derive LAS for discretizing reverse SDE, where LAS is lightweight and relies only on training loss.

Result: KL divergence bound of order O(H^2/K) (up to endpoint factors). LAS achieves improved sampling quality over common heuristic schedules in experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a dimension-free convergence perspective under mild conditions and a practical, loss-informed discretization scheme (LAS) that enhances sampling efficiency without heavy post-training computation.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

### [354] [Clarity: The Flexibility-Interpretability Trade-Off in Sparsity-aware Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21944)
*Konstantinos P. Panousis,Diego Marcos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzes how design choices in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for Vision-Language Models affect interpretability. Introduces a 'clarity' metric that combines downstream performance with sparsity and precision of concept representations; compares VLM-based and attribute-predictor CBMs under three sparsity strategies (per-example L1, L0, Bernoulli); finds a trade-off between interpretability and flexibility; provides an interpretability evaluation framework using ground-truth concept annotations; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting Vision-Language Models remains challenging as they are often treated as black boxes. CBMs, especially sparsity-aware variants, promise interpretability, but objective, systematic evaluation of their learned representations is scarce. This work seeks to quantify how modeling decisions impact emergent concept representations and their interpretability.

Method: Define 'clarity' as a metric balancing downstream accuracy with the sparsity and precision of concept representations. Compare two CBM families (VLM-based CBMs and attribute-predictor CBMs) under three sparsity-inducing schemes: per-example L1, L0, and Bernoulli-based. Use datasets with ground-truth concept annotations and an interpretability assessment framework to evaluate representations.

Result: Reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability: methods with similar downstream performance can exhibit markedly different interpretability. The choice of sparsity mechanism significantly affects the sparsity-precision-interpretability profile. No universal best approach; results highlight the need to align modeling decisions with interpretability goals.

Conclusion: Introduces the clarity measure and an interpretability evaluation framework for CBMs in VLMs. The work provides guidance on how to design CBMs with explicit interpretability considerations and will release code to support reproducibility and benchmarking.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the energy consumption of AI and explore hardware-friendly, realistic architectures for physics-based training beyond ideal densely connected models.

Method: Evaluate equilibrium propagation on locally connected lattice architectures by training an XY model, monitoring spatially distributed responses and couplings during training, and comparing performance to dense networks across benchmark tasks.

Result: Sparse networks with only local connections achieve performance comparable to dense networks.

Conclusion: Local connectivity suffices for competitive performance with equilibrium propagation in realistic settings; findings offer guidelines for scaling equilibrium-propagation-based architectures.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

*Linxiao Gong,Yang Liu,Lianlong Sun,Yulai Bi,Jing Liu,Xiaoguang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) for medical multimodal learning by representing each unimodal feature as a multivariate Gaussian and using an uncertainty-aware dynamic message-passing fusion on a bipartite patient-modality graph, enabling robust handling of missing modalities; demonstrates performance gains on MIMIC-IV and eICU mortality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical multimodal data frequently suffer from missing modalities and inherent data noise. Existing methods often assume equal modality contribution and random missingness, failing to capture uncertainty in data acquisition. There is a need for explicit unimodal aleatoric uncertainty modeling to guide reliable fusion.

Method: Model unimodal representations as multivariate Gaussian distributions (mean and covariance) to capture aleatoric uncertainty. Employ a dynamic message-passing mechanism on a bipartite patient-modality graph with uncertainty-aware aggregation to adaptively weight information from available modalities and accommodate missing ones. End-to-end training with a likelihood-based objective that leverages modality reliability during fusion.

Result: Reported improvements of 2.26% in AUC-ROC for MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% for eICU mortality prediction, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AUM offers principled unimodal uncertainty quantification and adaptive, uncertainty-aware fusion via dynamic message passing, improving performance in clinical multimodal tasks with missing modalities and suggesting broad applicability to other multimodal settings; prompts further work on calibration, ablations, and external validation.

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UA-DBO: uncertainty-aware data-based optimization using a probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate to quantify and penalize high-uncertainty samples during optimization; improves accuracy and robustness in airfoil multipoint optimization, with speedups relative to full simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBO performance hinges on training data; out-of-distribution samples during optimization can cause large surrogate errors, risking misleading updates; uncertainty quantification is needed to detect outliers and improve robustness.

Method: Introduce a probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate that predicts both outputs and their uncertainties; integrate uncertainty into a model-confidence-aware objective to penalize uncertain samples during data-based optimization; applied to two multipoint airfoil optimization problems focused on drag divergence and buffet.

Result: UA-DBO reduces surrogate prediction errors in optimized samples; achieves superior performance compared to vanilla DBO; offers comparable optimization effectiveness to full-simulation multipoint optimization while significantly accelerating the optimization process.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware DBO enhances robustness and efficiency in data-driven aerodynamic optimization by incorporating a probabilistic surrogate and uncertainty-aware objective to mitigate distribution drift and accelerate convergence.

Abstract: Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.

Motivation: Current LLM-centric TKGR approaches underutilize structural-temporal cues, leading to unreliable subgraph extraction and hallucination under temporal inconsistencies. A hybrid framework that grounds reasoning in data while leveraging external knowledge is needed.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) ground reasoning via a temporal GNN to identify coherent candidate paths; (2) LLM-guided path editing to fix logical/semantic issues and integrate external knowledge; (3) integrate refined paths to generate accurate, interpretable predictions.

Result: State-of-the-art on standard TKG benchmarks; relative gains up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on ICEWS; ablation studies confirm contributions of each component.

Conclusion: Hybrid integration of GNN-based temporal reasoning with LLM-guided editing yields accurate, interpretable TKGR predictions and improved robustness against temporal inconsistencies.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

*Ciaran Bench,Vivek Desai,Carlijn Roozemond,Ruben van Engen,Spencer A. Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Monte Carlo dropout-based predictive variance for FID and embedding features shows correlations with out-of-distribution degree, highlighting limitations of ImageNet-trained FID for medical images and offering a uncertainty-based diagnostic for FID trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FID relies on a natural-image pretrained feature extractor (InceptionV3 on ImageNet1K) and may fail to capture medical-image characteristics. The paper investigates how predictive uncertainty in FID and in latent embeddings relates to OOD, to assess the trustworthiness of FID in medical contexts.

Method: Apply Monte Carlo dropout to estimate predictive variance for FID and for the latent feature embeddings. Evaluate on ImageNet1K validation set with varying augmentations to simulate OOD and on other external datasets. Analyze correlations between predictive variances and the degree of distribution shift relative to training data.

Result: The magnitudes of the predictive variances exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs are out-of-distribution relative to the training data. This provides partial insight into the effectiveness of predictive variance as an indicator of FID trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Predictive variance can partly signal when FID is unreliable due to distribution shift toward medical-like data, but the correlation is not uniform. Caution is warranted when using FID for medical datasets; incorporating uncertainty estimates and possibly domain-specific features can improve assessment of synthetic image quality.

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

*Jian Gao,Yiwei Zou,Abhishek Pradhan,Wenhao Huang,Yumin Su,Kaiyuan Yang,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PowerGenie offers an automated, scalable framework for discovering high-performance reconfigurable power converters, combining an analytic bound framework with evolutionary finetuning of a generative model to improve design validity, novelty, and performance, demonstrated by an 8-mode converter with 23% FoM gain and SPICE-backed efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exponential design space of circuit topologies and the limitations of template-based or small-scale approaches, enabling rigorous, large-scale, performance-driven discovery without extensive SPICE sizing.

Method: 1) Automated analytical framework to determine converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE. 2) Evolutionary finetuning that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution using fitness selection and uniqueness verification to avoid mode collapse and overfitting.

Result: PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher figure-of-merit (FoM) than the best training topology. SPICE simulations show average absolute efficiency gains of ~10% across 8 modes and up to ~17% in a single mode; higher syntax validity, function validity, and novelty rate compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable, performance-driven discovery of high-quality power-converter topologies and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

### [361] [Elign: Equivariant Diffusion Model Alignment from Foundational Machine Learning Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21985)
*Yunyang Li,Lin Huang,Luojia Xia,Wenhe Zhang,Mark Gerstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Elign is a post-training framework that amortizes computational costs in E(3)-equivariant diffusion for 3D molecular conformations by (1) replacing DFT with a pretrained ML force field during inference, and (2) shifting energy guidance into training via reinforcement learning with FED-GRPO, achieving lower DFT energies/forces and improved stability with fast unguided sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure 3D molecular conformations respect Euclidean symmetries and thermodynamic stability while avoiding biases from semi-empirical data and reducing the computational burden of quantum-chemical evaluations.

Method: Dual amortization: (i) replace expensive DFT with a fast pretrained ML force field to provide physical signals; (ii) treat reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and train with Force–Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO), using a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, both group-normalized and optimized independently.

Result: Generated conformations exhibit lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces and improved stability; inference remains as fast as unguided sampling since no energy evaluations are needed during generation.

Conclusion: Elign demonstrates effective training-time RL-based steering to align diffusion sampling with high-fidelity Hamiltonians, enabling fast, accurate conformations without runtime energy evaluations, and suggests broader applicability to energy-guided diffusion in molecular design.

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

### [362] [Geometry of Drifting MDPs with Path-Integral Stability Certificates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21991)
*Zuyuan Zhang,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometric, homotopy-based framework for nonstationary discounted MDPs that tracks how the optimal Bellman point moves and uses HT-RL/HT-MCTS wrappers to adapt learning/planning, yielding better tracking and lower dynamic regret, especially under oscillations and switches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL is frequently nonstationary, with rewards and dynamics drifting and switching. Existing theory often measures only the magnitude of change, neglecting local geometric factors (acceleration, near-ties) that drive tracking error. A local, geometric view can enable tighter stability guarantees and adaptive control.

Method: Model the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and track the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. Define a length-curvature-kink signature that captures cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and nonsmoothness from near-ties. Prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions away from switch regimes. Develop HT-RL and HT-MCTS wrappers that online estimate proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity from replay data and adapt learning/planning intensity accordingly.

Result: Empirical results show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

Conclusion: The homotopy-tracking framework provides local stability certificates and adaptive mechanisms for nonstationary RL, enabling more robust performance via HT-RL and HT-MCTS in challenging environments.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length-curvature-kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

### [363] [Negatives-Dominant Contrastive Learning for Generalization in Imbalanced Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21999)
*Meng Cao,Jiexi Liu,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) with a new generalization bound emphasizing posterior discrepancy and decision margin, and a training objective that prioritizes negatives to separate decision boundaries across domains while ensuring intra-class compactness and posterior consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IDG must handle both domain shifts and long-tailed label distributions, which jointly shape decision boundaries. Existing methods lack theoretical foundations and effectively disentangle domain and label shifts; a boundary-centric approach with theoretical backing is proposed.

Method: Derives a generalization bound for IDG highlighting posterior discrepancy and decision margin. Proposes NDCL: (1) inter-class boundary separation by using negatives as primary signal in a contrastive loss; (2) re-weighted cross-entropy for intra-class compactness; (3) prediction-centered alignment to enforce posterior consistency across domains.

Result: Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate improved discriminability and robustness to label shift under domain heterogeneity. The authors provide code for reproduction at the given GitHub repository.

Conclusion: NDCL offers a principled boundary-focused approach to IDG, supported by a theoretical bound and solid empirical gains. It presents a viable direction for handling joint domain and label shifts in imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

*Anderson de Andrade,Alon Harell,Ivan V. Bajić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled rate-distortion framework for lossy compression in transformer inference, learning compact encodings that trade bitrate for accuracy; shows efficiency gains on language tasks and provides an information-theoretic lens plus PAC-style bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the inference cost of transformers by compressing intermediate representations across devices, enabling distributed execution while managing accuracy loss.

Method: Introduce a rate-distortion–based lossy compression scheme for transformer representations; learn encodings optimized for bitrate–accuracy trade-offs; derive bounds relating rate and entropy and provide PAC-style estimates; empirical evaluation on language benchmarks with comparisons to baseline methods.

Result: Substantial bitrate savings with improved accuracy in some cases; outperforms more complex baselines; offers a unified rate–distortion perspective for transformer representations and connects empirical performance to theoretical bounds across architectures/tasks.

Conclusion: Extends information-theoretic concepts to representation coding in transformers, defining rate–entropy gaps and providing PAC-based bounds; delivers explainability for how compression rates relate to model performance and supports communication-efficient, distributed inference.

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

### [365] [Exploring Diverse Generation Paths via Inference-time Stiefel Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22010)
*Dongxuan Zhu,Ly Tran Ho Khanh,Andy Yat-Ming Cheung,Man-Chung Yue,Viet Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STARS is a training-free, inference-time intervention that uses Stiefel-based activation steering to promote diverse outputs across concurrent generation runs by orthogonally steering hidden activations on the Stiefel manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models tend to produce a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leading to low diversity and mode collapse across parallel generations; there is a need for a lightweight, real-time method to induce diversity without retraining.

Method: At each token, STARS gathers hidden activations from concurrent generations and jointly optimizes multiple additive steering directions on the Stiefel manifold to maximize the volume of steered activations, enforcing orthogonality among steering directions via manifold constraints; this can be solved via Riemannian gradient descent, but a one-step closed-form step is proposed for low latency.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on test-case generation and scientific discovery tasks show STARS yields greater diversity than standard sampling methods without sacrificing qualitative performance.

Conclusion: STARS offers a training-free, inference-time mechanism to diversify generation trajectories by steering activations on the Stiefel manifold, achieving higher diversity with minimal latency.

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

*Sergi Masip,Gido M. van de Ven,Javier Ferrando,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A feature-centric mechanistic framework for catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, interpreting forgetting as geometric transformations of individual feature encodings that reduce representational capacity and disrupt downstream readout; supported by a tractable model, empirical validation, and practical analysis with Crosscoders on a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation focus on last-layer performance misses the underlying mechanisms of forgetting. A geometric, feature-level description can unify theory and practice in continual learning and guide architecture design.

Method: Introduce a tractable geometric model of feature encodings, analyze transformations during sequential tasks to identify best- and worst-case scenarios, test predictions empirically, assess depth effects, and demonstrate applicability to real models via Crosscoders with a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10.

Result: Transformations of feature encodings can decrease the allocated capacity of features and disrupt their readout, driving forgetting; depth is detrimental; empirical results support the theoretical predictions; Crosscoders facilitate applying the framework to practical models.

Conclusion: Proposes a new, feature-centric vocabulary and mechanistic framework for continual learning that connects theory with practice and enables analysis of practical models.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

*Robert Istvan Busa-Fekete,Julian Zimmert,Anne Xiangyi Zheng,Claudio Gentile,Andras Gyorgy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An embedding-based hierarchical clustering framework selects a small, informative set of documents for LLM quality labeling, achieving query efficiency under a subtree purity assumption and outperforming classifier-based filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality and diversity of training data for LLMs are critical but current quality metrics are expensive; scalable, cheap metrics are needed to estimate document quality without querying every document.

Method: Construct text embeddings for documents and build a hierarchical clustering. Iteratively select documents to query with an LLM to estimate cluster quality. The method is proven to be query-efficient: if the clustering contains a subtree with leaf clusters that are (almost) pure, then with high probability the algorithm can predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents; the required number of queries scales with the size of the smallest pure-subtree, without knowing it in advance.

Result: Theoretical guarantee of query efficiency under the purity-subtree assumption; comprehensive experiments showing the method outperforms classifier-based filtering methods on quality selection for LLM training data.

Conclusion: Embedding-based hierarchical clustering offers a scalable, query-efficient approach to estimating document quality for LLM training data, enabling better quality and diversity control at scale.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

*Haoran Tang,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLReg is a contrastive representation regularizer that reduces forget-retain representation entanglement in LLM unlearning by shaping representations to identify forget features and push them away from retain features, with minimal shifts to retained knowledge; empirically effective across benchmarks and model sizes, and does not introduce extra privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods often approximate retrain-from-scratch in the prediction space but can leave forgotten concepts entangled within representations, potentially leaking memory or hindering full forgetting.

Method: CLReg uses a contrastive objective to identify forget features and actively separate them from retain features in representation space, aiming to minimize interference with retain features while reducing forget-retain entanglement; includes theoretical insights linking representation shaping to entanglement reduction.

Result: Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of various sizes, CLReg reduces forgetting-related entanglement between forget and retain representations, facilitating mainstream unlearning methods without adding privacy risks; suggests future work on representation-space reshaping to remove forget concepts.

Conclusion: Represents a step toward representation-space-based unlearning; motivates future exploration of alignment-free or representation-focused strategies to eliminate forgotten concepts with minimal impact on retained knowledge.

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

*Zhengyan Huan,Camila Pazos,Martin Klassen,Vincent Croft,Pierre-Hugues Beauchemin,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP) and ensemble inverse generative models to perform non-iterative posterior inference by leveraging ensemble information, avoiding online forward-model calls, and generalizing across priors; demonstrated in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI with public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfolding/inverse problems require costly forward-model iterations; need inference-time methods that incorporate prior ensemble information and robust to unseen priors; desire non-iterative posterior samplers.

Method: Proposes ensemble inverse generative models that condition on both measurements and ensemble information; train across multiple truth–observation sets from the same forward model but varying priors, enabling implicit encoding of the likelihood; inference bypasses explicit forward-model evaluations.

Result: Benchmark on synthetic and real datasets across inverse imaging, HEP and FWI; shows improved posterior inference and generalization to unseen priors; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: Provides a non-iterative, training-time-leveraged posterior sampler for EIP, leveraging ensemble information to generalize across priors and reduce inference-time forward-model reliance.

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

### [370] [Per-parameter Task Arithmetic for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22030)
*Chengyi Cai,Zesheng Ye,Jiangchao Yao,Jianzhong Qi,Bo Han,Xiaolu Zhang,Feng Liu,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerTA introduces per-parameter task arithmetic to tailor forgetting vs. retention by rescaling the task vector with per-parameter weights estimated from gradients or diagonal Fisher information; it maintains TV efficiency while reducing over-forgetting and improving overall model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard task arithmetic (TV) can cause over-forgetting by applying a uniform parameter update. Different parameters contribute differently to forgetting and retention; per-parameter adjustment aims to preserve useful knowledge while removing privacy-sensitive information.

Method: PerTA adds per-parameter scaling factors to the TV, effectively weighting each parameter's contribution to unlearning. Two estimation approaches are proposed: PerTA-grad (weights derived from gradients to quantify forgetting/retention importance) and PerTA-fisher (weights derived from diagonal Fisher information). The method is extended into a more general form and analyzed.

Result: Extensive experiments show PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV and, in many cases, surpasses training-based unlearning methods in forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility.

Conclusion: PerTA preserves the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, offering a principled, practical framework for LLM unlearning.

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

TL;DR: A holography-inspired generative framework using AdS/CFT to augment flow-matching in ML, achieving faster convergence and interpretable physics on MNIST and a checkerboard dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage AdS/CFT geometry to provide physically meaningful inductive biases for flow-based generative models, potentially improving sample quality and convergence.

Method: Model data flow via bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS; integrate AdS physics into a flow-matching algorithm; evaluate on simple synthetic checkerboard and MNIST datasets.

Result: Faster convergence and higher-quality samples compared with physics-free flow-matching baselines; provides interpretable physics-based view of the flow; demonstrates utility of AdS geometry in generative modeling.

Conclusion: Shows that holographic physics can inform new generative modeling paradigms; invites broader exploration of AdS/CFT-inspired architectures for ML tasks.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

### [372] [Cross-Fusion Distance: A Novel Metric for Measuring Fusion and Separability Between Data Groups in Representation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22036)
*Xiaolong Zhang,Jianwei Zhang,Xubo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD) to quantify fusion and separability between representation groups under domain shift, isolating fusion-altering geometry while ignoring fusion-preserving transformations; claims linear complexity, theoretical guarantees, and better alignment with generalization degradation than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributional distances conflate geometry changes due to fusion with scale/layout variations, obscuring true fusion among groups; a metric that isolates the relevant geometry would better diagnose representation quality under domain shift.

Method: Define CFD with invariances to fusion-preserving factors, characterize invariance/sensitivity properties, prove linear computational complexity, validate on synthetic controls, and evaluate on real datasets under domain shift with comparison to baselines.

Result: CFD demonstrates robustness to fusion-preserving variations, theoretical properties established; in synthetic experiments validated; on real-world domain-shift data, CFD correlates more with generalization degradation than alternatives.

Conclusion: CFD provides a principled, interpretable, and efficient distance for representation learning to quantify fusion between data groups under domain shift.

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

### [373] [Making Foundation Models Probabilistic via Singular Value Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22068)
*Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu,Dominik J. Mühlematter,Alexander Becker,Konrad Schindler,Helge Aasen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVE is a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble that uses frozen singular vectors of weight matrices as a shared knowledge basis and trains per-member singular values to create diverse ensembles. It yields uncertainty quantification close to deep ensembles with <1% base-parameter overhead, improving calibration on NLP/vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of traditional deep ensembles for estimating epistemic uncertainty in large foundation models. Seek a scalable, parameter-efficient method that preserves predictive performance and calibration.

Method: Perform SVD on weight matrices to extract singular vectors (orthogonal knowledge directions). Freeze these vectors and train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction for each ensemble member. Ensemble diversity arises from random initialization and stochastic mini-batch training while keeping a shared basis, increasing base model parameters by <1%. Validate on NLP and vision benchmarks with various backbones.

Result: SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while keeping parameter overhead under 1% and maintaining predictive accuracy. It improves calibration across tasks and backbones in NLP and vision datasets.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable method for quantifying epistemic uncertainty in foundation models. By tying ensemble diversity to the manipulation of a shared, meaningful basis (weight space singular vectors), SVE delivers calibrated predictions with minimal parameter cost, enabling deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.

*Jae-Won Chung,Ruofan Wu,Jeff J. Ma,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large-scale energy-inference study reveals enormous variability across models, tasks, and configurations; introduces a framework to diagnose time/energy drivers across algorithm, software, and hardware layers; extends to throughput per watt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy and time consumption in ML inference vary widely and understanding the drivers is essential for optimization in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Large-scale measurement study across 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs to quantify inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape.

Result: Energy differences span orders of magnitude: LLM task type can cause up to 25x energy variation; video generation can exceed 100x energy of image generation; GPU utilization variations yield 3–5x energy differences.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework to reason about the underlying mechanisms (memory, utilization) that govern time and energy, influenced by algorithm, software, and hardware layers, and extends to throughput per watt for datacenter efficiency.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

### [375] [Latent Adversarial Regularization for Offline Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22083)
*Enyi Jiang,Yibo Jacky Zhang,Yinglun Xu,Andreas Haupt,Nancy Amato,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANPO introduces latent-space regularization for language-model preference optimization by adversarially aligning internal representations with a reference model, improving robustness to distributional shift and noise with modest overhead, while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-space similarity is not a reliable proxy for semantic/behavioral alignment in LM preference learning; hence a latent-space regularization signal is needed to guide policy updates more effectively.

Method: Propose GANPO, a GAN-inspired latent-space regularizer that penalizes divergence between the policy model's internal representations and a reference model. Because latent representations lack explicit probability densities, an adversarial loss is used to approximate and minimize latent-space divergence. GANPO is integrated as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple architectures and tasks show consistent improvements with GANPO. GANPO yields more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise, while attaining comparable downstream performance and incurring only minor additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: Latent-space regularization via GANPO provides robust, semantically meaningful feedback for offline LM preference optimization and offers a practical, efficient enhancement over token-level regularization.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

TL;DR: GeoNorm replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on a manifold in Transformer models, introducing layer-wise update decay; yields consistent performance gains with negligible cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization placement (Pre-Norm vs Post-Norm) and its optimization role remain unsettled. By viewing FFN and attention outputs as optimization update directions, the work seeks a principled, geometry-aware normalization that can enhance stability and accuracy without adding substantial overhead.

Method: Replace standard normalization with geodesic updates on a suitable manifold, interpreting FFN and attention outputs as update directions. Introduce a layer-wise update decay schedule for FFN and attention components, and integrate GeoNorm into standard Transformer architectures to compare with existing normalization schemes.

Result: Empirical results show GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods across Transformer models, with improvements achieved without significant computational overhead and easy integration.

Conclusion: GeoNorm offers a principled, geometry-based alternative to conventional normalization in Transformers, delivering performance gains with negligible cost and potential applicability across architectures.

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

### [377] [Boosting CVaR Policy Optimization with Quantile Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22100)
*Yudong Luo,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Augment CVaR-PG with an expected quantile term to utilize all samples via a DP formulation; preserves CVaR objective and improves sample efficiency and performance, with empirical gains in risk-averse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVaR-PG is sample inefficient due to tail-focused optimization; need a data-efficient method that leverages all sampled trajectories while maintaining CVaR risk constraints.

Method: Introduce an expected quantile term into CVaR optimization; show that quantile optimization admits dynamic programming that uses all data; establish that CVaR corresponds to the mean of the tail quantile; implement within Markovian policy class.

Result: Empirical results in risk-averse domains show substantial improvement over CVaR-PG and competitive to or better than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed quantile-augmented CVaR-PG improves sample efficiency and performance, preserving CVaR objective; future work could include theoretical guarantees and extensions beyond Markovian policies.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

### [378] [StepShield: When, Not Whether to Intervene on Rogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22136)
*Gloria Felicia,Michael Eniolade,Jinfeng He,Zitha Sasindran,Hemant Kumar,Milan Hussain Angati,Sandeep Bandarupalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StepShield introduces the first benchmark that evaluates when AI safety violations are detected (not just if), using temporal metrics and a large, realistic code-agent trajectory dataset. It shows substantial disparities between an LLM judge and a static analyzer in early detection and reports meaningful cost savings from early intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks measure only binary accuracy, conflating the ability to detect a violation with the opportunity to intervene early. A timing-aware evaluation clarifies safety and economic tradeoffs by quantifying when detections occur.

Method: Assembles StepShield with 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with an 8.1% rogue rate. Introduces three temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Compares an LLM-based judge to a static analyzer. Demonstrates economic impact via a cascaded HybridGuard detector and releases code/data under Apache 2.0.

Result: LLM-based judge attains 59% EIR, while a static analyzer achieves 26% (a 2.3× gap not captured by standard accuracy). Early detection with HybridGuard reduces monitoring costs by 75% and is projected to save $108M over five years at an enterprise scale.

Conclusion: Shifting evaluation from 'whether' to 'when' enables safer and more economically viable AI agents. StepShield provides a rigorous, timing-aware benchmark with open-source data and tools to catalyze further research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

### [379] [Prior-Informed Flow Matching for Graph Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22107)
*Harvey Chen,Nicolas Zilberstein,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIFM combines prior-informed initial adjacency estimates with rectified continuous-time flow matching to reconstruct graphs from partial observations, guided by permutation-equivariant distortion-perception theory, yielding improved reconstruction accuracy over classical embeddings and generative baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing graphs from partial observations requires both local information (from embeddings) and global structural consistency. Classical embeddings lack global coherence, while generative models struggle to incorporate strong structural priors. A method that fuses priors with principled flow-based refinement can achieve more accurate, globally consistent reconstructions.

Method: Form an informed initial adjacency using priors (e.g., graphons, GraphSAGE, node2vec) in a permutation-equivariant framework. Apply rectified continuous-time flow matching to refine the estimate toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learn a global coupling, thereby incorporating structural priors into a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple datasets shows that PIFM consistently improves upon classical embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: PIFM provides a principled framework that integrates embedding-based priors with flow-based refinement, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy and global consistency in graph reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

### [380] [Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22111)
*Abdullah Tasim,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coordinated UAS swarm combines Bi-LSTM-based local wind estimation with a physics-informed neural network to reconstruct 4D wind fields; achieves sub-0.2 m/s RMSE under moderate winds and preserves mean flow and vertical shear, without fixed sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatio-temporal gaps in lower-atmosphere wind measurements; conventional sensors are sparse and fixed; UAS swarms can provide distributed in situ data, enabling dense 4D wind-field reconstruction.

Method: Estimate local wind components from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM); then assimilate these estimates into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. Data are generated from a synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation for training and evaluation. Performance is reported across wind regimes and UAS configurations (best with five UAS).

Result: Local wind estimation RMSE (north/east): 0.064–0.062 m/s (low wind) to 0.271–0.273 m/s (high wind); vertical RMSE: 0.029–0.091 m/s. PINN reconstruction captures dominant spatial/temporal structure up to 1000 m altitude; mean wind RMSE under moderate wind: 0.118–0.154 m/s, with lowest error using five UAS. Demonstrates accurate, scalable 4D wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

Conclusion: Coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate 4D wind-field reconstruction and scalable deployment in the lower atmosphere, avoiding fixed instrumentation while preserving mean flow and vertical shear.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

*Winfried Ripken,Michael Plainer,Gregor Lied,Thorben Frank,Oliver T. Unke,Stefan Chmiela,Frank Noé,Klaus Robert Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting time-averaged (mean) phase-space evolution over a chosen Δt with a Mean Flow consistency constraint, enabling stable large-timestep updates beyond classic integrators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the timestep bottleneck in long-time Hamiltonian simulations, reduce reliance on expensive trajectory generation, and enable stable integration using mean-flow dynamics even with trajectory-free data.

Method: Train models to predict the mean phase-space evolution over Δt and enforce a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. This allows training on independent phase-space samples without future-state access, avoiding trajectory generation. The approach is validated on diverse Hamiltonian systems and leverages MLFF datasets for molecular dynamics.

Result: The framework achieves stable, large-timestep updates with performance improvements in molecular dynamics using MLFFs, while maintaining comparable training/inference costs and enabling training directly on trajectory-free MLFF data.

Conclusion: Mean Flow constraints enable accurate, stable long-time integration of Hamiltonian systems with large time steps and reduced data requirements, with broad applicability including MLFF-based MD.

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

*Daniel Stein,Shaoyi Huang,Rolf Drechsler,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Convert neural networks to logic flows for CPU execution by translating models into equivalent decision trees, extracting constant-leaf decision paths, and compressing them into if-else logic with fewer MACs; achieves up to 14.9% latency reduction on simulated RISC-V without accuracy loss. Open-source implementation NN2Logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPUs are not well-suited for large-scale MAC operations; resource-constrained edge devices require efficient NN inference without relying on GPUs. The work aims to improve CPU inference efficiency by replacing MAC-heavy computation with logic-flow execution.

Method: Transform the neural network into an equivalent decision tree representation, identify decision paths with leaves of constant values, select and compress these paths into logic flows represented as if-else structures, thereby reducing the number of MAC operations during inference.

Result: Latency is reduced by up to 14.9% on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any degradation in accuracy; the authors provide an open-source reference implementation (NN2Logic).

Conclusion: Logic-flow based execution is a viable approach to enhance NN inference efficiency on CPUs on resource-constrained devices, preserving accuracy while reducing computation and latency; the method is reproducible via the provided open-source tool.

Abstract: Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

### [383] [Discovering Hidden Gems in Model Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22157)
*Jonathan Kahana,Eliahu Horwitz,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hidden gems in fine-tuned models exist; a bandit-based search rapidly uncovers high-performance models overlooked by popularity, achieving 50x faster discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether repository usage concentration reflects efficient market selection or systematic neglect of superior models; quantify performance gaps and propose an efficient discovery method.

Method: Evaluate >2,000 models to identify underappreciated checkpoints; highlight Llama-3.1-8B; formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem; accelerate Sequential Halving via shared query sets and aggressive eliminations; achieve query-efficient selection (~50 queries per candidate).

Result: Unpopular fine-tunes significantly outperform popular ones; math accuracy improves from 83.2% to 96.0% without extra inference cost; discovery speed increased by over 50x.

Conclusion: Popularity-based selection may miss superior models; a bandit-based approach can surface high-performing fine-tunes efficiently, broadening access to better models.

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

TL;DR: Introduces Red-Green-Gray paradigm to classify roadmap edges in dynamic environments using cheap heuristics, enabling fast semi-lazy updates with competitive runtimes and higher accuracy vs Leven & Hutchinson.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain up-to-date, valid motion-planning roadmaps in non-static environments while minimizing expensive collision checks.

Method: Extend SPITE-based framework with three-state labeling (red/invalid, green/valid, gray/unknown), using cheap geometric heuristics to approximate robot swept volumes and perform lazy collision checks; label a subset of edges; compare against Leven & Hutchinson; report accuracy improvements and comparable runtimes.

Result: Preliminary experiments show higher accuracy and the ability to correctly identify invalid edges, with update runtimes similar to the baseline.

Conclusion: Red-Green-Gray provides an efficient semi-lazy roadmap update mechanism for dynamic environments; future work includes scaling to larger graphs, robust geometry handling, and exploration of additional heuristics.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Meta-ROS is a new middleware for robotics that aims to simplify integration and improve cross-platform performance. It leverages Zenoh and ZeroMQ to enable low-latency, high-throughput communication across diverse hardware, supporting audio, image, and video data. Benchmarking against ROS1/ROS2 shows up to 30% higher throughput, reduced latency, and better resource usage, along with robust hardware support and a developer-friendly design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics middleware like ROS2 suffers from complexity and interoperability challenges that hinder adoption by new developers and multi-platform deployments. There is a need for a streamlined, performant, cross-platform solution that can handle diverse data types in real-time robotic AI contexts.

Method: Design and implementation of Meta-ROS as a middleware framework. It uses modern communication protocols (Zenoh, ZeroMQ) to enable efficient cross-platform messaging. It supports multiple data types (audio, images, video) and was evaluated against ROS1 and ROS2 through performance benchmarks focusing on throughput, latency, and resource usage, as well as hardware compatibility and developer usability.

Result: Empirical evaluation indicates Meta-ROS achieves up to 30% higher throughput than ROS2, with significantly lower message latency and optimized resource usage. The framework also demonstrates robust hardware support and a developer-centric design that facilitates integration and ease of use.

Conclusion: Meta-ROS presents a compelling option for real-time robotics AI by delivering performance gains and improved usability over existing ROS-based middlewares, suggesting strong potential for broader adoption while highlighting the need for further real-world validation across platforms and workloads.

Abstract: The field of robotics faces significant challenges related to the complexity and interoperability of existing middleware frameworks, like ROS2, which can be difficult for new developers to adopt. To address these issues, we propose Meta-ROS, a novel middleware solution designed to streamline robotics development by simplifying integration, enhancing performance, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Meta-ROS leverages modern communication protocols, such as Zenoh and ZeroMQ, to enable efficient and low-latency communication across diverse hardware platforms, while also supporting various data types like audio, images, and video. We evaluated Meta-ROS's performance through comprehensive testing, comparing it with existing middleware frameworks like ROS1 and ROS2. The results demonstrated that Meta-ROS outperforms ROS2, achieving up to 30% higher throughput, significantly reducing message latency, and optimizing resource usage. Additionally, its robust hardware support and developer-centric design facilitate seamless integration and ease of use, positioning Meta-ROS as an ideal solution for modern, real-time robotics AI applications.

### [386] [Track-centric Iterative Learning for Global Trajectory Optimization in Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21027)
*Youngim Nam,Jungbin Kim,Kyungtae Kang,Cheolhyeon Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A track-centric, wavelet-parametrized, Bayesian-optimized full-horizon trajectory learning framework for lap-time minimization under uncertain dynamics, iteratively refining the trajectory with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational burden of full-horizon optimization and the mismatch between learned dynamics at the tracking level vs the trajectory itself; integrate trajectory optimization with dynamics learning to improve robustness and lap time.

Method: Represent trajectories in a track-agnostic space using wavelet transform; explore this space efficiently with Bayesian optimization; evaluate candidates by simulating with learned dynamics; iteratively deploy optimized trajectories to collect real-world data for updating dynamics and refining trajectories.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show up to 20.7% lap-time improvement over a nominal baseline and consistent outperforming of state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: A track-centric learning-optimization framework can effectively reduce lap time by coupling trajectory optimization with dynamics learning, mitigating model mismatch and achieving robust performance gains.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WheelArm-Sim demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven, integrated control for wheelchair and robotic arm systems. The dataset provides a foundation for future learning-based approaches and real-world transfer studies, advancing unified control in assistive robotics.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

Conclusion: InspecSafe-V1 constitutes a foundational benchmark that enables robust multimodal perception and safety assessment for industrial AI systems, promoting development of industrial foundation models and reliable autonomous inspection.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles.

For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

*Hao Cheng,Feitian Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A moving-mass LTA flight control framework combining real-time wind estimation with disturbance-aware MPC to robustly regulate attitude and heading under wind, outperforming PID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTA platforms offer long endurance but are highly wind-sensitive; there is a lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks. Moving-mass actuation provides a means to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for stability.

Method: A 2-DoF moving-mass mechanism is used in conjunction with a moving horizon estimator (MHE) to infer real-time wind perturbations, which are fed to a model predictive controller (MPC) to achieve robust trajectory and heading control under varying wind conditions.

Result: Flight experiments under headwind and crosswind show the MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms a baseline PID controller in maintaining stability and tracking under disturbances.

Conclusion: Disturbance-aware MHE-MPC control with moving-mass actuation enhances LTA flight stability in disturbance-prone environments, validated by extensive flight tests.

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamics that learns a QP-based safety filter by combining Hamilton-Jacobi reachability with model-free learning; the learned safety critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative) even for non-smooth value functions, improving safety and learning efficiency across diverse systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe control for unknown or black-box dynamical systems where explicit models are unavailable. The goal is to enforce safety constraints while enabling efficient RL, without relying on accurate dynamics models.

Method: Learn a Quadratic-Program safety filter using two neural networks trained with contraction-based losses on the safety value (and its derivatives) derived from Hamilton-Jacobi reachability; no model knowledge is used. The approach ensures convergence to the viscosity solution of the HJ PDE, even in non-smooth cases, in the exact setting.

Result: Empirically reduces pre-convergence failures and accelerates learning to higher returns across diverse dynamical systems, including a hybrid system, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, practical route to safe, model-free control by integrating HJ reachability with model-free learning to produce a data-driven safety filter that preserves safety while enhancing learning efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) for MPC motion planners extends parameter tuning to non-executed actions via fast- and slow-level tuning, improving tuning efficiency and safety in complex environments; Doppler LiDAR integration aids predictive estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myopic parameter tuning based on executed actions suffers from sparse failure events, hindering rapid adaptation; proactive evaluation of non-executed actions addresses data sparsity and accelerates tuning.

Method: Introduce HPTune with a fast-level tuner using risk indicators from predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and a slow-level tuner using an extended evaluation loss for backpropagation; fuse with Doppler LiDAR to obtain obstacle velocities; validated in high-fidelity simulation.

Result: HPTune achieves efficient MPC parameter tuning and outperforms baselines in complex environments; enables situation-tailored, safe and agile collision avoidance.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, proactive parameter tuning with sensor-augmented perception enables adaptable, safe motion planning in MPC frameworks; the approach leverages non-executed-action data and backpropagation for sustained performance gains.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

*Weidong Huang,Zhehan Li,Hangxin Liu,Biao Hou,Yao Su,Jingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAC with large-batch updates and high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio enables scalable pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies and safe, sample-efficient adaptation via model-based finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sample inefficiency of on-policy methods for humanoid control and close the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning, aiming for zero-shot real-robot deployment.

Method: Pretrain off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) using large batch updates and high UTD to train humanoid locomotion policies in simulation. For adaptation, collect data with a deterministic policy in new environments while performing stochastic exploration through a physics-informed world model, enabling model-based fine-tuning for new tasks/environments.

Result: SAC-pretrained policies enable zero-shot deployment on real robots. In new environments and out-of-distribution tasks, finetuning via model-based methods is effective. Separating exploration (world model) from data collection (deterministic policy) mitigates risk during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage.

Conclusion: This approach achieves wall-clock efficiency during large-scale pretraining through simulation and leverages model-based learning for sample-efficient fine-tuning, bridging the gap between pretraining and adaptation for humanoid locomotion.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

*Leonidas Askianakis,Aleksandr Artemov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Latent-space policy learning for space grasping using SAC in a multimodal latent representation; achieves >95% success in under 1M steps; faster and more robust than visual baselines under open-loop single-shot conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation in unstructured, high-variance environments suffers from high-dimensional actions, sparse rewards, and poor generalization. Space grasping presents extreme conditions requiring sample-efficient, robust policies.

Method: Train policies in a learned latent manifold that fuses multiple modalities into a structured representation. Use GPU-accelerated physics simulation to create single-shot manipulation tasks. Apply Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL in latent space with continuous control.

Result: Achieves over 95% task success in under 1M environment steps. Demonstrates faster convergence than representative visual baselines under same open-loop single-shot conditions. Latent-space reasoning yields improved sample efficiency and robustness to novel object/gripper geometries, clutter, and sensor configurations.

Conclusion: Explicit latent-space reasoning enhances sample efficiency and robustness for grasping under variable conditions. Identifies current limitations and outlines future directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable space grasping in extreme conditions.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

*Weitao An,Qi Liu,Chenghao Xu,Jiayi Chai,Xu Yang,Kun Wei,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav) introduces two evaluation stances (TSU and SIB) and a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) to replace single-pass scoring, improving decision reliability under partial observability. It demonstrates gains in success and path efficiency with less exploration on HM3Dv1/2 and MP3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration in navigation systems arise from single-pass scoring in zero-shot perception and reasoning. There is a need for more reliable action evaluation under partial observability using complementary objectives.

Method: Construct two complementary evaluation stances: Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues; Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) emphasizes risk and information value. The stances debate and cross-check their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. A Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) aggregates both sides' evidence, with optional lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices.

Result: Empirical validation on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D shows consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

Conclusion: Stance-based, evidence-grounded arbitration enhances action reliability in navigation under partial observability, yielding more efficient and robust indoor service robot navigation.

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

### [396] [Singularity-Free Lie Group Integration and Geometrically Consistent Evaluation of Multibody System Models Described in Terms of Standard Absolute Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21413)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A bridging framework that enables Lie group-based time integration for multibody systems described in absolute coordinates, using SO(3)×R3 and SE(3) representations with local–global transition maps (LGT) to update global coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MBS modeling in absolute coordinates faces singularity issues in spatial motion parameterization. Although Lie group integration respects geometry and avoids singularities, it is not readily compatible with standard EOM formulations; a way to interface Lie group methods with existing absolute-coordinate codes is needed.

Method: Introduce a twofold contribution: (1) a framework to interface Lie group integrators with standard EOM formulations for MBS described in absolute coordinates; (2) a method to incorporate rigid-body geometry into EOM evaluation when using vector-space integrators. Represent rigid body motions with direct/semidirect product groups SO(3)×R3 and SE(3). Central to the approach is the local-global transition (LGT) map, enabling updates of global absolute coordinates from local Lie-group coordinates, specific to the chosen absolute coordinates and Lie group.

Result: Provides a concrete method to describe MBS in absolute coordinates while employing Lie group integrators, through the LGT map that ties local Lie-group updates to global coordinates, and demonstrates compatibility with standard MBS simulation frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed LGT-based framework enables geometry-respecting, singularity-free integration within existing MBS codes by marrying absolute-coordinate EOM with Lie-group time integrators.

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

*Alexandre Chapin,Bruno Machado,Emmanuel Dellandréa,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR) improve generalization in robotic manipulation by clustering dense features into a fixed set of object-like slots, reducing noise while preserving task-relevant information; they outperform global and dense representations under distribution shifts, even without task-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address generalization under visual distribution shifts (lighting, texture, distractors) by reducing mixed task-relevant/irrelevant information in pre-trained encoders through an object-centric representation.

Method: Benchmark SBOCR against global and dense representations across simulated and real-world manipulation tasks. Build a fixed number of slots from dense features to form an intermediate object-centric representation, and evaluate generalization under diverse visual conditions without requiring task-specific pretraining.

Result: SBOCR-based policies outperform both dense and global representations under distribution shifts across tasks of varying complexity; improvement persists without task-specific pretraining, indicating effective noise reduction and retention of essential task information.

Conclusion: Slot-based object-centric representations are a promising direction for robust visual representations in dynamic robotic environments, suggesting further exploration and integration with learning systems to enhance generalization.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

TL;DR: Nimbus is a modular, scalable synthetic data framework that unifies heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines through a four-layer, asynchronous architecture, yielding 2–3x end-to-end throughput gains and robust large-scale operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable embodied AI requires vast, diverse synthetic data; current data-generation pipelines are fragmented, task-specific, and unstable, limiting throughput and scalability for foundation-model training.

Method: Nimbus adopts a four-layer architecture with a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. It employs dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations to maximize CPU/GPU/I/O resource utilization.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Nimbus delivers 2–3× higher end-to-end throughput than unoptimized baselines and remains robust for long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments.

Conclusion: Nimbus provides a unified, efficient, and resilient foundation for cross-domain synthetic data generation, serving as the production backbone for the InternData suite and enabling scalable data synthesis for foundation-model training.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

*Shanliang Yao,Zhuoxiao Li,Runwei Guan,Kebin Cao,Meng Xia,Fuping Hu,Sen Xu,Yong Yue,Xiaohui Zhu,Weiping Ding,Ryan Wen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unified 4D radar–camera calibration and auto-labeling via a dual-purpose calibration target; robust correspondence matching; automatic transfer of camera annotations to radar point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating 4D radar with cameras is difficult due to modality-specific targets and manual labeling; a single, unified approach reduces effort and improves alignment for robust multi-modal perception in autonomous driving.

Method: Introduce a dual-purpose calibration target with a front checkerboard for camera detection and a back surface corner reflector for radar detection. Develop a robust correspondence matching that links the checkerboard center to the strongest radar reflection point. Use calibrated extrinsics to transfer camera-based annotations to radar via geometric projection and multi-feature optimization for auto-labeling.

Result: Demonstrates high calibration accuracy and substantial reduction in manual annotation effort across extensive experiments, accelerating development of multi-modal perception systems.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, unified calibration and auto-labeling framework that simplifies 4D radar–camera fusion and expedites the creation of annotated radar datasets for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

*Xingyu Zhang,Chaofan Zhang,Boyue Zhang,Zhinan Peng,Shaowei Cui,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexTac integrates rich visuo-tactile data from kinesthetic demonstrations into a policy for contact-aware dexterous manipulation, achieving high success on a unimanual injection task and outperforming force-only baselines in high-precision syringe scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited and low-dimensional tactile information in existing dexterous manipulation datasets and learning pipelines by incorporating multi-dimensional tactile priors (contact force distributions and spatial contact regions) learned from human demonstrations.

Method: DexTac uses kinesthetic teaching to collect visuo-tactile data (multi-dimensional tactile signals) directly from human demonstrations and fuses these modalities into a policy network that selects and maintains optimal contact regions during complex interactions.

Result: On a challenging unimanual injection task, DexTac attains a 91.67% success rate; in high-precision, small-scale syringe scenarios, it outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%.

Conclusion: Learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

*Anna Rothenhäusler,Markus Mazzola,Andreas Look,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Bödecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MatchInformer enforces a one-to-one prediction-ground-truth mapping for occluded agent reasoning, reduces redundancy via Hungarian matching, refines trajectories by decoupling heading from motion, and uses MCC for robust occupancy evaluation, achieving superior results on Waymo Open Motion Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occluded traffic agents create unseen or partially visible entities, leading to incomplete planning and redundant predictions. Redundant results increase computation and complicate downstream decision-making; robust, non-ambiguous predictions are essential for safe autonomous driving.

Method: Extends SceneInformer with Hungarian Matching to enforce one-to-one correspondences between predictions and ground truth. Decouples an agent's heading from its motion to improve trajectory interpretation. Evaluates occupancy with Matthews Correlation Coefficient to handle class imbalance. Trains and tests on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Result: Improved occlusion reasoning and trajectory accuracy compared to prior methods, with reduced duplicate predictions and more robust occupancy evaluation on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating Hungarian matching and heading-motion decoupling yields more reliable and interpretable predictions for occluded agents; MCC is a robust metric under imbalance, enhancing evaluation of occupancy predictions.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

*Joonhee Lee,Hyunseung Shin,Jeonggil Ko*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IROS is a real-time indoor navigation framework that blends fast reflexes with selective VLM-based reasoning on-device, achieving 66% latency reduction and improved decision accuracy compared to continuous VLM navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to reconcile fast, robust semantic understanding for indoor robotics: classical SLAM offers reliable localization but lacks semantic cues; VLA models are reactive; full VLMs incur high latency. IROS aims to provide real-time, semantically grounded navigation on low-cost hardware.

Method: Dual Process-inspired architecture: System One uses lightweight perceptual modules for fast reflexive decisions; System Two invokes compact VLMs only when deliberative reasoning is necessary. Augments compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues for richer grounding. Implemented on on-device hardware and evaluated in five real-world buildings, comparing against continuous VLM-based navigation.

Result: Reported 66% reduction in latency and improved decision accuracy versus continuous VLM navigation; demonstrated real-time performance on low-cost hardware and robust navigation through integration of spatial/textual cues.

Conclusion: IROS shows that separating fast perceptual decisions from selective, on-demand VLM reasoning enables real-time, context-aware indoor navigation on-device, with potential applicability to other context-rich perception tasks. Future work may address hardware dependency, robustness to signage variability, and broader generalization across environments.

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

Motivation: To achieve split-second, energy-efficient decision making for fast-paced robotic tasks and demonstrate brain-inspired hardware with on-line learning capabilities.

Method: A mixed-signal neuromorphic processor implements a small spiking network with fixed random connectivity to capture task temporal structure. The readout uses a local e-prop learning rule and reinforcement learning; training occurs in a hardware-in-the-loop setup combining a computer with the neuromorphic chip.

Result: The system achieves real-time learning and successful puck interactions with a very small number of trials, enabling practical, on-line training of SNNs for robotic control.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that brain-inspired hardware and learning rules can address fast interaction tasks and support continuous learning in intelligent machines, bridging neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotics.

Abstract: Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

Conclusion: AIR-VLA establishes a standardized benchmark and data resource for advancing research in general-purpose aerial robotics, with the dataset and platform to support future studies and model development.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

*Hao Ju,Shaofei Huang,Hongyu Li,Zihan Ding,Si Liu,Meng Wang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Shifts mobile manipulation from instruction-driven to sound-triggered autonomy using Habitat-Echo; introduces a data platform for acoustic-physical interaction and a baseline with a planner and policies; demonstrates robustness in dual-source acoustic interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of instruction-driven agents that rely on predefined commands, restricting autonomy and responsiveness to dynamic auditory events.

Method: Develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform integrating acoustic rendering with physical interaction; propose a hierarchical baseline consisting of a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to perceive, plan, and act in response to sound-emitting objects without explicit instructions; evaluate in diverse scenarios including dual-source interference.

Result: The baseline enables agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events without case-by-case instructions; in a dual-source scenario, the agent isolates the primary source from interference to perform the first interaction and then manipulates the secondary object, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: Sound-triggered mobile manipulation is viable; the proposed framework provides autonomy and robustness to acoustic interference, and the Habitat-Echo platform supports further research in auditory-driven manipulation.

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoFreeVLA augments Vision-Language Action models with a short-horizon self-collision risk estimator to gate dangerous commands, enabling safer dual-arm manipulation and improved success on PiPER tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns in dual-arm manipulation due to under-modeled self-collisions between arms and grasped objects; a lightweight, proprioception- and vision-informed risk estimator can prevent unsafe commands and guide safer policy refinement.

Method: Integrates an end-to-end VLA with a short-horizon collision risk estimator that uses proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, applies risk-guided adjustments to recover safe states, and guides policy refinement for safer rollouts. Pre-training uses model-based collision labels; post-training calibrates with real robot rollouts. Evaluated on five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm.

Result: The approach reduces self-collisions and improves task success rates compared with RDT and APEX across five bimanual tasks on PiPER.

Conclusion: Risk-aware architecture like CoFreeVLA can enhance safety in dual-arm manipulation by gating risky actions and calibrating both the perception-to-action mapping and policy rollouts; pre-training on model-based signals combined with post-training real-world calibration yields practical gains.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts. It is pre-trained with model-based collision labels and posttrained on real robot rollouts for calibration. On five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm, CoFreeVLA reduces selfcollisions and improves success rates versus RDT and APEX.

*Donatien Delehelle,Fei Chen,Darwin Caldwell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient, modular RL for cloth manipulation reduces model size and training time, achieving better performance than baselines on SoftGym and enabling sim-to-real transfer with a smaller model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and self-occlusion; RL is promising but data-intensive; end-to-end vision-based policies incur high computational costs and lossy state representations.

Method: Proposes a modular, efficient RL approach with careful design choices to shrink model size and training time when learning in simulation; emphasizes simulation-trained models transferred to the real world; evaluated on SoftGym against baselines.

Result: Significant performance improvements over available baselines on SoftGym with a substantially smaller model.

Conclusion: A modular, simulation-first RL design can achieve robust cloth manipulation performance with reduced computation and successful sim-to-real transfer, challenging end-to-end image-based approaches.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HPSF approaches struggle with unreliable mode transitions and inefficient driving in dense traffic due to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates.

Method: LAP uses an LLM for scene understanding and integrates its inference into a joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The optimization is solved by a combination of tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. Implemented in Python on ROS.

Result: In high-fidelity simulations, LAP outperforms benchmarks in driving time and success rate.

Conclusion: LLM-driven adaptive planning can enhance HPSF for autonomous driving by enabling context-aware mode switching and improved trajectory generation, with practical feasibility demonstrated in ROS-based simulations.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce actuator density and DOF of dense soft-robotic surfaces while preserving manipulation performance, enabling scalable handling of fragile and heterogeneous objects.

Method: Introduce a distributed, modular MANTA-RAY platform with object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that maps tilt-angle controls directly to actuator commands. Avoids data-driven training. Evaluate in simulation across 3x3 and 4x4 configurations and validate with a physical 2x2 prototype.

Result: The multi-module platform manipulates objects with varied geometries, masses, and textures (including fragile items like eggs and apples). Demonstrates parallel manipulation and improved scalability across larger areas.

Conclusion: A modular, reduced-actuation MANTA-RAY maintains performance, enabling scalable, coordinated manipulation over larger surfaces and showing potential for practical, real-world applications.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

*Jinhao Zhang,Wenlong Xia,Yaojia Wang,Zhexuan Zhou,Huizhe Li,Yichen Lai,Haoming Song,Youmin Gong,Jie Me*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Variational Regularization (VR) enhances diffusion-based visuomotor policies by adding a timetable-conditioned Gaussian bottleneck over backbone features and a KL penalty, reducing task-irrelevant noise and achieving state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld with notable accuracy gains; inference-time feature masking reveals latent noise in intermediate representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversized denoising decoders in diffusion-based visuomotor policies introduce redundancy and noise in intermediate features. Additionally, randomly masking backbone features at inference suggests significant task-irrelevant information in features. There is a need for a lightweight regularization that adaptively constrains information flow to backbone representations.

Method: Introduce Variational Regularization (VR): a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian distribution over backbone features and adds a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. The module can be integrated with existing diffusion-based visuomotor policies. The observation of inference-time feature masking motivates a concise, information-theoretic constraint rather than increasing model capacity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld shows that VR improves success rate by 6.1 percentage points on RoboTwin2.0 and 4.1 percentage points on Adroit/MetaWorld compared to the baseline DP3, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments confirm practical effectiveness. Code will be released.

Conclusion: VR provides an effective, lightweight regularization to suppress task-irrelevant information in backbone features, enabling better performance for diffusion-based visuomotor policies without substantial computational burden and with positive sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

*Lorenzo Mazza,Ariel Rodriguez,Rayan Younis,Martin Lelis,Ortrun Hellig,Chenpan Li,Sebastian Bodenstedt,Martin Wagner,Stefanie Speidel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A supervised Mixture-of-Experts on top of an action-decoder (ACT) enables efficient long-horizon surgical manipulation from <150 demonstrations using stereo endoscopy; outperforms Vision-Language-Action models and standard ACT, with strong generalization including unseen viewpoints and zero-shot ex vivo porcine tissue; qualitative in vivo results reported.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and stringent safety/predictability requirements in surgical robotics by enabling robust, data-efficient learning for phase-structured manipulation tasks.

Method: Train a lightweight action decoder policy (ACT) augmented with a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture on top of ACT. Use stereo endoscopic images and <150 demonstrations to learn long-horizon bowel grasping and retraction, evaluated against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models and the standard ACT baseline. Assess in-distribution performance and robustness to out-of-distribution factors (novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, occlusions), generalization to unseen viewpoints, and zero-shot transfer to ex vivo porcine tissue, with qualitative in vivo surgery rollouts.

Result: MoE-augmented ACT yields higher success rates in-distribution and significantly better robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios than ACT alone; Vision-Language-Action models fail to acquire the task. The approach generalizes to unseen viewpoints and transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue. Qualitative preliminary in vivo porcine results are reported."

Conclusion: Supervised MoE augmentation of ACT improves data efficiency, generalization, and robustness for phase-structured surgical manipulation, offering a promising path toward safer and more deployable in vivo robotic surgery. Further rigorous quantitative validation and safety evaluations are needed.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

### [414] [Macro-Scale Electrostatic Origami Motor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21976)
*Alex S. Miller,Leo McElroy,Jeffrey H. Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First macro-scale origami rotary motor that folds flat and unfurls to operate, using corona discharge to produce torque. Demonstrates expansion 2.5:1, top speed 1440 rpm at -29 kV, and max torque >0.15 mN·m with active torque density 0.04 Nm/kg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a gap in foldable robotics by delivering a macro-scale continuous rotary actuator integrated into origami folding media, enabling rotary motion rather than only linear/folding actuation.

Method: Developed a foldable origami motor architecture that can be folded flat and unfurled; employs corona discharge as the torque source; characterized expansion ratio, speed, torque, and torque density under high voltage.

Result: Expansion ratio 2.5:1; top speed 1440 rpm at -29 kV; maximum output torque >0.15 mN·m; active torque density 0.04 Nm/kg.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of a macro-scale origami rotary motor actuated by corona discharge; introduces a novel approach to integrated, foldable rotation for macro origami robotics; future work should address efficiency, control strategies, safety of high voltage, durability, and scalability.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

*Jinhao Zhang,Zhexuan Zhou,Huizhe Li,Yichen Lai,Wenlong Xia,Haoming Song,Youmin Gong,Jie Me*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PocketDP3: a compact 3D diffusion policy using a Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks to replace heavy conditional U-Net decoders, achieving state-of-the-art results with <1% of the parameters and enabling two-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural mismatch in 3D diffusion policies: small point-cloud encoders are paired with large decoders, causing parameter waste. A pocket-scale, efficient diffusion policy aims to preserve performance while enabling real-time deployment.

Method: Replace the heavy conditional U-Net decoder with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) based on MLP-Mixer blocks, enabling efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions. Supports two-step inference without extra distillation. Trained on compact 3D scene representations and evaluated on RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld; real-world transfer demonstrated; code to be released.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, MetaWorld) with less than 1% of the parameters of prior methods and faster inference; real-world experiments validate practicality and transferability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that compact diffusion policies can match or exceed prior performance with drastically reduced parameters, enabling real-time deployment. The DiM-based design offers efficient temporal-channel fusion and may generalize to broader 3D manipulation tasks; code release will facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

*Runsheng Wang,Katelyn Lee,Xinyue Zhu,Lauren Winterbottom,Dawn M. Nilsen,Joel Stein,Matei Ciocarlie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Healthy-domain pretraining with small stroke data improves robust sEMG-based intent detection and reduces calibration needs for post-stroke rehabilitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce calibration burden and improve robustness of sEMG-based intent detection in stroke, which is brittle and highly variable; leverage transferable healthy EMG representations.

Method: Pretrain on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then adapt per-stroke using minimal subject data; compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, LoRA adapters, full fine-tuning); dataset from 3 chronic stroke participants; evaluation with distribution shifts (within-session drift, posture change, armband repositioning).

Result: Healthy-pretrained adaptation improves stroke intent detection over zero-shot and stroke-only training; best methods raise average transition accuracy 0.42→0.61 and raw accuracy 0.69→0.78.

Conclusion: Transferring reusable healthy-domain EMG representations can reduce calibration burden and improve robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynamicVLA is a compact 0.4B Vision-Language-Action model for dynamic object manipulation, enabling continuous inference and latent-aware action streaming, paired with the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark (200k synthetic episodes across 2.8k scenes and 206 objects, plus 2k real-world episodes). It shows faster response, improved perception, and better generalization across embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic object manipulation remains challenging for VLA models due to the need for rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control in dynamic scenarios. A lack of dynamic manipulation datasets further hampers progress. A compact, fast, and temporally aligned VLA framework is needed to bridge perception and action in dynamic contexts.

Method: Three core designs: (1) a compact 0.4B VLA with a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding and fast multimodal inference; (2) Continuous Inference enabling overlapping reasoning and execution to reduce latency and adapt to object motion in real time; (3) Latent-aware Action Streaming to align perception and action temporally, reducing gaps between perception and execution. Dataset contribution includes the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark built from scratch with an auto data-collection pipeline gathering 200K synthetic episodes over 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, plus fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation.

Result: Extensive evaluations report remarkable improvements in response speed, perception accuracy, and generalization for dynamic object manipulation, showing DynamicVLA as a unified framework that generalizes across different embodiments.

Conclusion: DynamicVLA fills the missing foundation for dynamic manipulation data and tasks, offering a unified framework with a rich DOM benchmark that supports rapid, temporally aligned perception and action across embodiments.

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.
