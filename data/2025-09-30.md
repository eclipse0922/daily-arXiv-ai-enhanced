### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact behavioral audit (MATS) evaluates whether Vision-Language Models reject visually contradicted statements. It finds instruction-tuned generative VLMs have poor truthfulness (low SCS, high IAR) while contrastive encoders are more robust; activation patching localizes failure sites and guides repairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks often miss systematic, real-world failures in multimodal truthfulness. A compact, interpretable audit can reveal where models fail and guide targeted improvements to trustworthiness.

Method: Introduce MATS with two metrics (Spatial Consistency Score and Incorrect Agreement Rate). Evaluate on instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) and contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP). Use activation patching to localize failure loci: mid-to-late cross-attention for generative models; pooled projection components for contrastive models; derive concrete repair paths.

Result: Generative VLMs exhibit very low SCS and high IAR, indicating susceptibility to visually contradicted statements. Contrastive encoders show stronger performance with higher SCS and lower IAR. Activation patching causally localizes failures to specific architectural components, suggesting targeted repair strategies.

Conclusion: MATS provides a compact, actionable audit for truthfulness in Vision-Language Models. Findings point to architecture-dependent failure loci and offer concrete directions to improve robustness through targeted modifications to cross-attention or projection components.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast joint scale-rotation estimation with sub-pixel precision using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and auxiliary-function cross-correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image alignment requires robust handling of scale and rotation variations, which traditional phase-correlation cannot address. Accurate alignment across viewpoints is critical in medical imaging and computer vision.

Method: Transform images to log-polar coordinates and apply Fourier-based cross-correlation to detect scale and rotation as shifts in log-polar space; maximize a cross-correlation using the auxiliary function method and incorporate sub-pixel cross-correlation for precise estimates.

Result: Experimental results show lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation compared with conventional Fourier-transform-based methods that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The approach delivers accurate, efficient joint estimation of scale and rotation, improving image alignment when scale/rotation changes are present and suggesting wide applicability in CV and medical imaging.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that enhances Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to improve robust multimodal detection, showing improved accuracy and robustness on autonomous driving benchmarks, with ablations highlighting reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at vision-language tasks but struggle with structured perception requiring precise localization and robustness; optimization with sparse/noisy rewards remains challenging. A curriculum-driven RL approach could stabilize training and enable progressive handling of complex samples.

Method: Augment GRPO with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering within a reinforcement learning framework; include KL regularization and structured data pacing to stabilize optimization under sparse/noisy rewards and adapt to increasingly difficult samples.

Result: Substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness on autonomous driving benchmarks; ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing for convergence stability and generalization.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula offers a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection in real-world tasks such as autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Topological graph constraints (Topology Graph Consistency, TGC) are introduced for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in pathology, enforcing global topology by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency between prediction and reference graphs, yielding state-of-the-art results with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense, pixel-level annotations are costly in computational pathology, and pixel-consistency-based SSL often propagates noisy labels and yields fragmented or topologically invalid masks; enforcing global topology can improve segmentation quality under limited supervision.

Method: Construct and align prediction graphs with reference graphs by matching Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics, integrating these graph-theoretic constraints into the SSL framework to enforce global topology in segmentations.

Result: On GlaS and CRAG datasets, TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: Topology-aware graph constraints improve semi-supervised segmentation in computational pathology and can substantially reduce annotation needs; code is publicly released.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [TACO-Net: Topological Signatures Triumph in 3D Object Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24802)
*Anirban Ghosh,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO-Net introduces a topology-informed pipeline that voxelizes point clouds, extracts topological features via filtration, and classifies with a lightweight 1D CNN, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet40/ModelNet10 and strong robustness to corruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification faces challenges from unordered, irregular, and noisy point clouds. Conventional point-based deep nets struggle to capture global structure and are sensitive to noise. Topological data analysis (TDA) can provide robust, permutation-invariant features that encode global shape information.

Method: Convert each point cloud to a voxelized binary 3D image, apply topological data analysis with multiple filtration techniques to extract distinguishing topological features, and train a lightweight 1D CNN (TACO-Net) on these features for classification.

Result: Achieves 99.05% on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10, claiming state-of-the-art performance; demonstrates robustness on OmniObject3D; shows resiliency across ten corrupted ModelNet40 inputs.

Conclusion: The approach delivers SOTA 3D object classification by combining TDA-derived features with a compact 1D CNN, achieving high accuracy and robustness while enabling efficient deployment; supports the promise of topology-guided representations for real-world 3D data.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

### [6] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey contrasting supervised and unsupervised person re-identification (ReID), reviewing recent advances and highlighting the narrowing gap as unsupervised methods improve, with dual objectives: summarize supervised progress and analyze unsupervised developments over the last three years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address scalability challenges in labeling for supervised ReID and understand how unsupervised methods can leverage unlabeled data to close performance gaps.

Method: systematic literature review and categorization of supervised ReID publications; analysis of unsupervised ReID developments in the last three years; synthesis of trends and potential convergence.

Result: comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in supervised ReID, identification of challenges and diminishing gains; insights into unsupervised progress and emerging trends toward performance parity; proposal of future research directions.

Conclusion: the field exhibits strong supervised performance with limited marginal gains, while unsupervised approaches are rapidly improving, suggesting a convergence path; the survey underscores the importance of scalable learning and future directions toward unified frameworks.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [7] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sequential Token Merging (STM) reduces token counts in Vision Mambas (ViMs) by bidirectional nearest-neighbor merging and hidden-state protection, preserving sequential dependencies and stabilizing the class token. It leverages LDSD/hidden-state dynamics to achieve strong efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas offer sub-quadratic complexity but still suffer from quadratic token scaling with image resolution. There is a gap: token redundancy is addressed in part, but the intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) and selective scan allow gradual information aggregation in hidden states. The goal is to exploit these properties to reduce tokens without harming performance, improving efficiency and providing insights into state-space dynamics.

Method: Sequential Token Merging (STM) introduces: (1) Bidirectional nearest-neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation; (2) Hidden states protection to stabilize hidden states around the class token; STM leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability. It reduces tokens progressively and adapts across layers to maintain performance.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows STM achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal accuracy loss: ViM-Ti with 20% token reduction incurs only 1.0% accuracy drop; ViM-S with 40% reduction incurs 1.4% drop. The method demonstrates superior efficiency at low complexity and provides new insights into state-space dynamics.

Conclusion: STM advances token-efficient ViMs by respecting LDSD and hidden-state dynamics, enabling significant token reductions with negligible accuracy loss. It offers a practical, scalable approach and contributes theoretical insight into sequential information flow in Vision Mamba models. Code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

### [8] [Deep Learning Empowered Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22692)
*Le Zhang,Ao Li,Qibin Hou,Ce Zhu,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A holistic survey of super-resolution (SR) methods across SISR, VSR, SSR, and LFSR, including a backbone-based taxonomy, datasets, protocols, and a public repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR surveys are often domain-specific and do not offer a comprehensive view across multiple SR modalities; a holistic overview is needed to guide researchers and identify open questions.

Method: Systematic literature review covering 150+ SISR methods, ~70 VSR approaches, and ~30 SSR/LFSR techniques; taxonomy by backbone structures; analysis of methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, results, and computational complexity; compilation into a dedicated repository.

Result: A detailed holistic review with cross-mode insights, a backbone-based taxonomy, practical guidance on open issues, and a public repository for related work.

Conclusion: The work provides a valuable, broad resource for SR researchers, enabling a unified understanding of trends, identifying underexplored areas, and supporting future research directions.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [9] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CLIP-like adaptation of a Vision-Language Model for hyperspectral scene understanding using a frozen large embedding model with a trainable probe and class-descriptive prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results while updating only 0.07% of parameters and using far smaller models than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imagery has high-dimensional 3D voxels and strong domain shifts from natural images. The goal is to enable effective cross-modal alignment between vision for HSIs and textual semantics with minimal parameter updates for efficiency, aiming to improve data efficiency and performance.

Method: Employ a CLIP-style contrastive training framework that maps voxel-level vision embeddings to the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM). A trainable probe aligns vision features with the LEM’s textual token representations. A contrastive loss uses hard negatives, semi-hard distractors, and positives, with descriptive prompts serving as structured anchors to encode class semantics.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on hyperspectral benchmarks Indian Pines (IP) and Pavia University (PU). On IP, OA improves by 0.92 and κ by 1.60; on PU, OA improves by 0.69 and κ by 0.90. The method updates only 0.07% of total parameters and uses models roughly 50x and 90x smaller than DCTN and SS-TMNet, respectively.

Conclusion: A highly parameter-efficient method for hyperspectral scene understanding via cross-modal alignment with a frozen LEM and a trainable probe, supplemented by descriptive prompts, yielding substantial accuracy gains and strong data efficiency.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [10] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-shot federated prompt learning method (GPR-NIAM) with non-interfering attention masking that isolates prompt–text interactions and uses cross-silo refinement to achieve cross-task generalization, outperforming SOTA on ten benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FPL relies on multi-round communication and struggles with cross-task generalization in one-shot settings; there is a need to prevent prompt–text interference and leverage decentralized knowledge to enable robust cross-task generalization.

Method: Two modules: (1) attention isolation to suppress attention from learnable prompts to original text tokens and reweight reverse attention to preserve generalization; (2) cross-silo collaborative refinement to fuse decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and align multi-source cross-modal information to calibrate the global prompt.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ten datasets across two tasks shows GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM effectively reduces interference between prompt and text embeddings, improving one-shot FPL generalization; cross-modal multi-source alignment mitigates data heterogeneity, indicating strong potential for cross-task generalization in federated prompt learning.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

*Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GZSL-MoE integrates Mixture-of-Experts into a Generative Zero-Shot Learning framework to synthesize 3D point cloud features (via KPConv) for unseen classes to improve segmentation on seen/unseen classes on the COVERED dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In 3D point cloud segmentation, labeled data for all classes is scarce; GZSL can synthesize features for unseen classes to enable labeling; MoE is used to better capture complex, multi-modal feature distributions.

Method: Incorporates Mixture-of-Experts into Generator and Discriminator of a GZSL framework; uses features extracted by a pre-trained KPConv on seen classes; generates fake features resembling real ones; trained on the COVERED HRC dataset; aims to improve segmentation across seen/unseen classes.

Result: Claims improved performance on both seen and unseen classes, demonstrating promise for complex 3D environments.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE offers a promising direction for zero-shot 3D segmentation in HRC settings with limited training data; further empirical evaluation and ablations recommended.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [12] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT) inject CNN-like inductive biases into Vision Transformers via learnable masks, enabling accurate training on small datasets without knowledge distillation while preserving Transformer explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which hampers data efficiency on small datasets. The work seeks to recover these biases without resorting to distillation.

Method: Introduce learnable masks that embed CNN-like inductive biases into Vision Transformers, creating IBiT. Train on small datasets without knowledge distillation to adapt the architecture and biases.

Result: IBiT achieves significantly higher accuracy than standard Vision Transformers on small datasets and maintains the explainability characteristic of Transformer models.

Conclusion: Learning inductive biases through masks makes Vision Transformers more data-efficient on small datasets without needing distillation, while retaining explainability.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [13] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate semantic layouts and scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to generate realistic multi-object scenes with explicit spatial reasoning and semantic richness, addressing limitations of diffusion models (geometry, relations) and robotics planning (semantic content).

Method: Preprocess inputs with vision-language models to produce segmentation, object sizes, a scene graph, and rewritten prompts; use compositional diffusion to synthesize bounding boxes that respect the scene graph; render the final scene with a foreground-conditioned generator guided by prompts.

Result: LayoutAgent outperforms current layout-generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism, and aesthetic alignment on experiments.

Conclusion: Bridges vision-language reasoning and diffusion-based generation for layout-aware image synthesis, offering a path toward semantically and geometrically consistent multi-object scenes.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

TL;DR: CompareBench introduces a visual comparison benchmark for vision-language models with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (quantity, temporal, geometric, spatial), derived from TallyBench and HistCaps, evaluated on closed- and open-source models. Results reveal scaling trends but persistent weaknesses in temporal ordering, spatial relations, counting, and geometric comparisons, highlighting a blind spot in multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored skill of visual comparison in vision-language models and provide a controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation that reveals systematic weaknesses and guides future improvements.

Method: Construct a benchmark with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (600 quantity, 100 temporal, 200 geometric, 100 spatial). The data come from two auxiliary datasets (TallyBench: 2000 counting images with QA; HistCaps: 515 historical images with bilingual captions). Evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series).

Result: Models show clear scaling trends but fail on temporal ordering and spatial relations; basic counting and geometric comparisons are often incorrect despite human ease; indicates visual comparison is a systematic blind spot in current VLMs.

Conclusion: CompareBench provides a controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation framework for visual comparison in multimodal reasoning, establishing a foundation for improving the reliability of VLMs in comparison tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR proposes a test-time, cross-modal reasoning method that searches a unified latent space for image and text tokens, guided by an image-quality critic, achieving state-of-the-art results without fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning-based image generation methods are constrained to a single modality (image or text) or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. There is a need for a test-time, cross-modal reasoning approach that can leverage both modalities in a unified latent space to improve synthesis, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: MILR performs policy-gradient guided search over discrete image and text token vectors within a unified latent space. It is implemented within the MUG framework that enables language-before-image synthesis, uses intermediate model outputs as the latent space, and operates entirely at test time with an image quality critic guiding optimization.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, with a WISE score of 0.63 (about 80% improvement over the baseline). The results indicate that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is crucial for performance, and qualitative analysis shows temporal and cultural reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Cross-modal, test-time reasoning in a unified latent space is effective for image generation, enabling robust, knowledge-intensive reasoning without finetuning. MILR’s approach highlights the power of unified representations and careful guidance (image quality critic) for cross-modal synthesis.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

### [16] [UESA-Net: U-Shaped Embedded Multidirectional Shrinkage Attention Network for Ultrasound Nodule Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22763)
*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-Net variant for breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation that uses multidirectional shrinkage attention to fuse global context with local details, achieving state-of-the-art IoU on TN3K and BUSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound suffers from speckle noise and weak global-local feature interactions; there is a semantic gap between global context and local detail; need architecture that reconciles high-level semantics with low-level spatial cues.

Method: A U-shaped encoder-decoder network with multidirectional shrinkage attention. Within each encoding block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions to capture spatial details; a shrinkage threshold strategy integrates prior knowledge with local features. The decoder uses a pairwise shrinkage mechanism to merge prior low-level cues with encoder features, enabling better context modeling.

Result: On TN3K (3493 images) IoU 0.8487; on BUSI (780 images) IoU 0.6495; reported as state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: UESA-Net aggregations of multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

### [17] [PartCo: Part-Level Correspondence Priors Enhance Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22769)
*Fernando Julio Cendra,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo introduces Part-Level Correspondence Priors to Generalized Category Discovery, leveraging part-level visual relationships to improve fine-grained categorization and lift current GCD methods without major changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCD methods rely on semantic labels and global image features, which miss fine-grained part-level cues needed to distinguish closely related categories.

Method: Propose PartCo to incorporate part-level correspondences as priors into existing GCD frameworks, enhancing finer-grained semantic structure while compatible with current methods without significant modification.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show PartCo improves existing GCD approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results by aligning semantic labels with part-level visual compositions.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges semantic labels and part-level visual cues, providing a plug-in improvement for GCD that yields notable performance gains and sets new benchmarks.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT: Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning for text-to-image models updates via two low-rank components, enabling efficient personalization and universal generation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the efficiency-personalization-generalization trade-off in fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models, balancing new concept learning from limited data with maintaining broad instruction ability and editability.

Method: Update decomposition: project updates onto the complement of a low-rank subspace (defined by one trainable low-rank matrix) and add a second trainable low-rank update within that subspace, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art performance on Dreambooth/Dreambench Plus for personalization, InsDet for object/scene adaptation, and VisualCloze for visual in-context learning with Stable Diffusion and a unified model.

Conclusion: DEFT provides an effective, parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for T2I models, delivering personalization, generalization to universal generation, and editability with strong empirical results; code available.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is
available on \href{https://github.com/MAXNORM8650/DEFT}{DEFTBase}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScore2 provides multi-dimensional, interpretable evaluation for video generation, scoring visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency with chain-of-thought rationales; trained on a large annotated dataset and enhanced by GRPO-based RL; achieves superior in-domain and out-of-domain performance and enables reward modeling for controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video evaluation largely yields a single opaque score and lacks interpretability across the visual, semantic, and physical aspects of videos. A multi-dimensional, human-aligned, interpretable framework is needed to better assess and guide text-to-video generation.

Method: Two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning on a large dataset (VideoFeedback2 with 27,168 human-annotated videos providing scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions), followed by reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to boost analytical robustness. Outputs include explicit scores and chain-of-thought rationales for three dimensions: visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency.

Result: VideoScore2 achieves 44.35 accuracy on the in-domain VideoScore-Bench-v2 (+5.94 over baselines) and 50.37 average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc.), demonstrating superior performance while delivering interpretable assessments that support reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges evaluation and controllable generation by providing interpretable, multi-dimensional assessments aligned with human judgment. It enables effective reward modeling for controlled video generation and is available via the project page.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

### [20] [TRUST: Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22813)
*Sahar Dastani,Ali Bahri,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Moslem Yazdanpanah,Mehrdad Noori,David Osowiechi,Samuel Barbeau,Ismail Ben Ayed,Herve Lombaert,Christian Desrosiers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST uses test-time refinement for Vision SSMs (VMamba) by generating multiple traversal permutations to obtain diverse causal views, updating Mamba-specific parameters with pseudo-labels, and averaging the adapted weights to improve robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs (e.g., VMamba) show degraded generalization under distribution shifts. Existing TTA methods may not exploit the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.

Method: At test time, TRUST creates diverse traversal scans (permutations) of the input image to produce multiple causal perspectives. Model predictions serve as pseudo-labels to refine Mamba-specific parameters. The adapted weights from each traversal are averaged to produce the final prediction, explicitly leveraging SSM architecture.

Result: Empirical evaluation on seven benchmarks shows TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach to explicitly exploit SSM architectural properties for adaptation in vision tasks, yielding improved robustness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

*Jaeik Kim,Woojin Kim,Woohyeon Park,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB introduces the first large-scale benchmark for personalizing vision-language models (VLMs) with 10k image-query pairs and 111 concepts across four categories, revealing that current models struggle with consistency, user preferences, and adapting to visual cues in a three-stage evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable user-centric AI for multimodal systems, it is essential to evaluate how well VLMs can adapt to individual preferences and identities, which existing benchmarks overlook.

Method: Create MMPB: a 10k image-query dataset covering 111 personalizable concepts across humans, animals, objects, and characters (with preference-grounded queries for humans). Propose three task types to probe different VLM properties. Assess 23 VLMs (open and closed) using a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying.

Result: Most VLMs struggle with personalization, especially maintaining dialogue consistency, honoring user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Notable issues include refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting, indicating room for improvement. The benchmark is scalable and informative for future research in personalized multi-modal AI.

Conclusion: MMPB provides a scalable, widely applicable benchmark and a solid foundation for advancing truly personalized multi-modal AI, highlighting current gaps and guiding future development. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully controllable adversarial patch framework using a generative U-Net and Grad-CAM-guided patch placement to achieve semantic-aware, realistic patches that target a specific class. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CNNs and ViTs, with attack success rate and target-class success exceeding 99%, while maintaining realism and black-box applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current patch attacks rely on unrealistic white-box access, untargeted objectives, or visibly conspicuous patches, limiting real-world deployment. There is a need for realistic, targeted, and black-box compatible patch attacks that can be controlled by the attacker.

Method: A generative U-Net produces patches and a Grad-CAM-guided placement strategy to localize patches semantically. The attacker selects input x and target class y_target; the method optimizes patch content and placement to maximize the likelihood of the model predicting y_target while preserving visual realism. The approach emphasizes semantic-aware patch placement and supports black-box applicability.

Result: Extensive experiments on DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16 (and others) show attack success rate and target-class success exceeding 99% across settings, outperforming prior white-box, untargeted baselines, and non-realistic, artifact-prone approaches.

Conclusion: The framework achieves realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial patch attacks and bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet introduces a patch-based cross-attention, multi-scale time-series architecture with intrinsic temporal explainability, achieving strong forecasting performance and robust temporal saliency detection, outperforming many transformer baselines while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability in time series forecasting is crucial for transparency and decision-making. Post-hoc saliency methods are often expensive and unreliable; temporal saliency is particularly challenging and benefits from intrinsic, training-time explainability.

Method: A patch-based cross-attention architecture called CrossScaleNet that incorporates multi-scale processing. Attention mechanisms are embedded during training to provide intrinsic temporal saliency. The approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets with ground-truth saliency, public benchmarks, and real-world forecasting tasks, with comparisons to transformer-based models.

Result: The method shows robust temporal saliency detection and maintains or improves forecasting accuracy, outperforming most transformer-based models on benchmarks. It demonstrates strong explainability without sacrificing performance and highlights limitations of existing explainable models which often trade off accuracy.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet offers a balanced solution that delivers effective temporal saliency detection and state-of-the-art forecasting performance across diverse datasets, addressing the gap where explainability methods sometimes incur performance costs.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transfer-learning with a multimodal interactive perception network and a slice interaction module (SIM) improves IGTV segmentation in PET/CT for lung cancer radiotherapy, achieving Dice 0.609 vs 0.385 baseline on a private IGTV dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGTV delineation is crucial for motion-aware radiotherapy in lung cancer but hampered by scarce annotated IGTV data and weak PET signal at tumor boundaries.

Method: A transfer-learning pipeline: pre-train on extensive GTV datasets (MAMBA) and fine-tune on a private IGTV PET/CT cohort from LUCID. Introduce a slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework, combining channel and spatial attention with depthwise convolutions to model inter-slice dependencies.

Result: Dice score of 0.609 on the private IGTV dataset, substantially higher than the conventional baseline 0.385.

Conclusion: Combining transfer learning with a SIM in a multimodal segmentation framework can enhance IGTV reliability and clinical relevance for lung cancer radiotherapy planning; suggests strong potential for data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based generative model, ControlEvents, synthesizes labeled event data using foundation-model priors guided by text and poses; reduces labeling cost and improves downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth labeled event data is scarce and expensive to obtain, hindering event-based vision research. A scalable data-generation approach is needed.

Method: ControlEvents uses diffusion-based generation guided by control signals (class text labels, 2D skeletons, 3D body poses) and leverages diffusion priors from foundation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to enable high-quality event data with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled data.

Result: Synthesized event data improves performance on tasks such as visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation; the model can generate events for unseen text labels.

Conclusion: The approach reduces data-generation costs while enabling high-quality labeled event datasets and demonstrates strong text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of learning-based DIR (data-hungry, modality-specific; INRs need instance optimization; classical methods are accurate but slow) by employing KANs to compactly and robustly represent deformations, and randomized basis sampling to further reduce computation.

Method: Extend INRs with KANs (KAN-IDIR) and RandKAN-IDIR. Use randomized basis sampling to reduce the number of basis functions. Evaluate on lung CT, brain MRI, cardiac MRI; compare to instance-learning, dataset-trained DL, and classical approaches; test seed stability.

Result: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieve the highest accuracy among INR-based methods across presented modalities with minimal overhead and robust performance across seeds; RandKAN-IDIR with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms baselines using learnable basis indices while avoiding extra training-time cost.

Conclusion: KAN-based INR DIR is a promising, efficient, and stable approach for multi-modal deformable registration, with RandKAN-IDIR offering improved robustness and reduced training complexity; applicable to diverse imaging domains.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

### [27] [Convolutional Set Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889)
*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) processes image sets directly as 3D tensors, integrating feature extraction and set-level reasoning to outperform vector-input approaches, enable explainability via Grad-CAM, and support transfer learning with pre-trained CST-15 on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle image sets with arbitrary size and heterogeneous visuals that share high-level semantics without relying on sequential CNN+SET cascades; current methods operate on embeddings and lose end-to-end synergy and explainability.

Method: Introduce CST, a neural architecture that operates directly on 3D image tensors to perform simultaneous feature extraction and contextual modeling of image sets. CST handles arbitrary set cardinality, yields inter-image relationships, and is compatible with Grad-CAM. The approach supports pre-training on large datasets (CST-15 on ImageNet) and transfer learning.

Result: CST achieves superior performance on Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection, offers native Grad-CAM compatibility for explainability, and demonstrates transfer learning capability via pre-training on ImageNet with CST-15 for adaptation to new domains/tasks.

Conclusion: CST enables end-to-end processing of image sets, improving performance and transparency over cascaded methods and enabling practical transfer learning through a pre-trained CST backbone.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST delivers state-of-the-art IRSTD performance with real-time inference and robust cross-dataset generalization, achieved via architectural innovations, targeted attention mechanisms, cost-reducing pruning, and a regression-stabilizing loss (NWD). The work includes publicly available resources.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a

### [29] [Learning Unified Representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22917)
*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an embedding-based representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) using continuous submanifold fields to preserve color and geometry, enforce unique mapping, and improve learnability over raw Gaussian parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw Gaussian parameters are non-unique and heterogeneous, making learning difficult and data-dependent. A principled, structured, and homogeneous representation is needed to preserve intrinsic information for neural networks performing 3DGS reconstruction.

Method: Proposes an embedding representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encode the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, enabling unique mappings and channel-homogeneous features for neural networks while preserving color and geometric structure.

Result: Conceptual/architectural proposal with claimed benefits for learning 3DGS; the abstract does not report empirical results or experiments.

Conclusion: An embedding representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting via continuous submanifold fields to provide a principled, learnable representation that preserves color/geometry and ensures consistent mapping in neural-network models.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

### [30] [Soft-Di[M]O: Improving One-Step Discrete Image Generation with Soft Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22925)
*Yuanzhi Zhu,Xi Wang,Stéphane Lathuilière,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft embeddings enable differentiable, end-to-end distillation of one-step generators by replacing discrete tokens with their expected embeddings under the generator's distribution, overcoming gradient-blocking and teacher bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address modeling bias and non-differentiability in one-step diffusion-based distillation (Di[M]O) and to unlock post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO).

Method: Introduce soft embeddings as a differentiable relaxation: compute the expected embeddings given the generator's output distribution and use them in place of discrete tokens. Integrate this into the Di[M]O framework to form Soft-Di[M]O, ensuring compatibility with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders so end-to-end training and downstream refinements are possible.

Result: Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), including improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, and higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning; additional gains from Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO).

Conclusion: Soft embeddings preserve token representations while providing a differentiable surrogate, enabling end-to-end training of one-step generators and facilitating GAN-based refinement, reward fine-tuning, and TTEO, leading to superior one-step performance.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 uses multimodal few-shot learning with LLM-generated text and diffusion-based image augmentation to boost marine fish recognition across taxonomic levels, achieving strong hierarchical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome incomplete datasets and low accuracy in few-shot scenarios for rare marine fish species, enabling scalable ecological monitoring and conservation.

Method: Train on a hierarchical marine fish benchmark; generate high-quality textual descriptions with DeepSeek, augment images via Stable Diffusion 2 using a hierarchical diffusion strategy to obtain latent encodings for a multimodal feature space; employ a CLIP-based model for few-shot recognition.

Result: Top-1 accuracy 91.67% and Top-5 97.97% at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT, with notable gains for minority classes (<10 training samples). At genus/species levels, Top-1 accuracies are 87.58% and 85.42%, respectively.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 enhances efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and offers a scalable solution for ecological monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A ResNet50-based feature extractor with Global Average Pooling and a novel Dense-Dropout module for brain tumor MRI detection, paired with the MMCBT dataset (balanced via augmentation) to improve learning, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor detection in MRI is time-critical and current resources are scarce; class imbalance and overfitting hinder deep learning models. A reliable, efficient pipeline and a larger, balanced dataset are needed.

Method: Use pretrained ResNet50 for feature extraction, followed by Global Average Pooling and a linear projection to compact features. Apply a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance non-linear feature learning, reduce overfitting, and boost robustness. Introduce the MMCBT dataset (209 subjects, ages 9–65) with 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images; balance achieved by augmenting the tumor class.

Result: Dense-Dropout is reported to enhance non-linear feature learning, reduce overfitting, and improve robustness. The MMCBT dataset is balanced and clinically verified, making it suitable for deep learning research.

Conclusion: The framework, together with the MMCBT dataset, addresses data scarcity and class imbalance in brain-tumor MRI detection, with Dense-Dropout as a promising component for robust medical image learning.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

*Kasra Davoodi,Mohammad Hoseyni,Javad Khoramdel,Reza Barati,Reihaneh Mortazavi,Amirhossein Nikoofard,Mahdi Aliyari-Shoorehdeli,Jaber Hatam Parikhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hemorica is a public, richly annotated head CT dataset (372 scans, 2012–2024) for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with five subtypes, enabling multi-task learning and robust baselines; demonstrates strong annotation quality and baseline performance for detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome fragmented public datasets and enable robust AI for ICH by providing a comprehensive, well-annotated, clinically realistic CT dataset that supports multi-task learning, transfer to larger weakly labelled cohorts, and AI-assisted ICH detection/quantification.

Method: Assembled 372 head CT exams covering 2012–2024; exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes (EPH, SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH) with patient-wise and slice-wise labels, subtype-specific bounding boxes, 2D masks, and 3D voxel masks. Double-reading workflow with pilot consensus and neurosurgeon adjudication to ensure low inter-rater variability. Established baselines using standard CNNs/transformers on binary slice classification and hemorrhage segmentation; fine-tuned lightweight models (e.g., MobileViT-XS) and a U-Net with DenseNet161 encoder for segmentation.

Result: Baseline results show MobileViT-XS achieving an F1 score of 87.8% on binary slice classification after minimal fine-tuning; U‑Net with DenseNet161 encoder attaining a Dice score of 85.5% for binary lesion segmentation. The dataset annotations and evaluation demonstrate realism and adequate sample size for robust benchmarking and multi-task learning.

Conclusion: Hemorica offers a unified, fine-grained benchmark enabling multi-task learning and transfer to larger weakly labeled cohorts, and supports the development of AI-based assistants for ICH detection and quantification, backed by validated annotation quality.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

### [34] [ARSS: Taming Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation for View Synthesis From Single View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23008)
*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS proposes a causal, autoregressive framework for novel view synthesis from a single image, conditioned on a camera trajectory. It uses a video tokenizer, a camera encoder, and an autoregressive transformer that permutes spatial token order to preserve AR structure. It achieves competitive or superior results to diffusion-based methods, with code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based view synthesis struggles with causal consistency across views and incremental knowledge integration, limiting world-modeling tasks. Autoregressive models offer causal generation, suggesting a method better suited for creating consistent sequences (views) from sparse inputs.

Method: A GPT-style decoder-only autoregressive model generates novel views conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. A video tokenizer maps image sequences to discrete tokens. A camera encoder converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. An autoregressive transformer module randomly permutes spatial token order while preserving temporal order to maintain AR causality.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets show ARSS performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-model-based view synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: ARSS provides a causal alternative to diffusion for novel view synthesis from sparse inputs, achieving strong performance while maintaining autoregressive structure; code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

*Masato Kobayashi,Ning Ding,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamics from static scene with an independence loss and a scene prediction loss, shown to be effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static cues dominate action recognition models, causing poor real-world and zero-shot performance; reducing static bias is necessary for robust recognition.

Method: Introduce two streams (unbiased temporal dynamics and biased static scene). Enforce statistical independence between streams with an independence loss and include a scene prediction loss to preserve scene information.

Result: Experiments demonstrate reduced static bias and confirm the importance of the scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: Separating dynamic information from static scene using independence and scene prediction losses effectively mitigates static bias in action recognition; the scene prediction loss is crucial for performance.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [36] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesenAT reduces reliance on point-cloud features by feature desensitization, pruning sensitive components, adversarial training, and self-distillation, yielding improved robustness to corrupted 3D data without sacrificing clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs for point clouds are vulnerable to corrupted data due to over-reliance on input features. This work quantifies feature sensitivity and investigates whether reducing dependence on these features can boost robustness in 3D tasks.

Method: 1) Quantify feature sensitivity with Shapley values and identify highly contributing features; 2) prune highly sensitive features at a fixed ratio to study impact; 3) propose Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT): remove high-contribution data points, apply spatial transformations to simulate corruption, generate adversarial samples, and train adversarially; 4) apply self-distillation to transfer knowledge from clean to adversarial samples and perform distillation-based adversarial training; 5) evaluate on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C.

Result: DesenAT improves robustness to corrupted point clouds on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C without degrading performance on clean data; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Reducing sensitivity to point-cloud features via desensitized training and self-distillation is an effective strategy to enhance 3D model robustness against corrupted data while preserving clean accuracy.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-video sign language translation method that enforces anatomical realism by modeling skeletal joint relationships with geometric constraints, reweighting to boost finger flexibility, and bone-length/pose losses; achieves substantial gains in realism and motion naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language translation requires natural, plausible body motion; previous methods neglected anatomical constraints leading to rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs.

Method: Model joint relationships among shoulders, arms, hands with geometric constraints on positions, bone lengths, movement dynamics. Training uses a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to increase finger flexibility; include bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints.

Result: Performance gap to ground truth oracle narrows by 56.51%; bone length discrepancies reduced by 18.76%; movement variance reduced by 5.48%; improves anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Conclusion: Explicit skeletal constraints plus targeted regularization yield more anatomically consistent and natural sign-language video outputs, closing gap with oracle.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Motivation: Limitations of language-only reasoning in LLMs/VLMs for decision-making and planning, and the potential of unified multimodal models (UMMs) to enable reasoning via generated visual content and multimodal outputs.

Method: Proposes Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Introduces self-discriminated filtering, using the generative model as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions, mitigating hallucinations. Evaluates on long-horizon planning tasks.

Result: Uni-Plan substantially improves success rates over VLM-based methods, demonstrates strong data scalability, requires no expert demonstrations, and outperforms with the same training data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of UMMs for reasoning and decision-making and lays a foundation for future research in planning with unified multimodal models.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

### [39] [Copyright Infringement Detection in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23022)
*Xiafeng Man,Zhipeng Wei,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DP-inspired post-hoc detection framework (DPM) for copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models, introducing a conditional sensitivity metric and the CIDD benchmark to detect infringements without access to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address legal and ethical concerns about memorization and reproduction of copyrighted content by large vision models; provide a robust, theoretically grounded detection method.

Method: Formally define copyright infringement in DP terms, introduce a conditional sensitivity metric analogous to DP sensitivity, and operationalize with D-Plus-Minus (DPM). DPM simulates inclusion/exclusion by fine-tuning models in opposing directions (learning vs. unlearning) and uses confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions to separate concept-specific influence from global parameter shifts. Also, construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD) for benchmarking.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without access to the original training data or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in generative AI; the CIDD benchmark enables standardized evaluation.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, practical framework for copyright infringement detection in diffusion models, along with a standardized benchmark, contributing to safer deployment of large vision models.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

### [40] [Perceptual Influence: Improving the Perceptual Loss Design for Low-Dose CT Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23025)
*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces perceptual influence, a metric to quantify how much perceptual loss contributes to LDCT denoising, and a principled framework to study how design choices (feature level, encoder pretraining data, loss weight) impact performance; finds common setups underperform relative to better-designed alternatives and provides guidelines and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual losses can preserve semantic content in LDCT reconstructions, but design choices are often ad-hoc and may undermine benefits. A systematic assessment is needed to understand how feature representation, pretraining data, and loss weighting affect denoising quality.

Method: Define perceptual influence; systematically vary perceptual-loss design choices (feature extraction level, encoder pretraining dataset, loss weighting) in LDCT denoising experiments; quantify impact on noise reduction and structural fidelity; perform statistical analysis; provide evaluation guidelines; release source code.

Result: Better-designed perceptual-loss configurations yield significant improvements in noise suppression and structural fidelity without changing network architecture; many widely used configurations underperform; the proposed framework and guidelines enable more effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Conclusion: A principled evaluation of perceptual-loss design choices improves LDCT denoising outcomes and offers actionable guidelines; the perceptual influence metric can guide future loss-design decisions.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [41] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sensor-flexible flood detection using a lightweight multi-modal transformer (Presto) that can process SAR, MS, or both for rapid flood mapping, achieving strong performance and robustness across data-availability scenarios with reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operational flood monitoring faces single-sensor limitations and data/resource constraints; there's need for a model that works with whatever sensor data is available and with limited labeled data.

Method: Fine-tune Presto (~0.4M parameters) to handle SAR and MS inputs at pixel level; single architecture supports SAR-only, MS-only, or fused inputs; compared against Prithvi-100M baseline (~100M params) on Sen1Floods11 under three data-availability scenarios.

Result: F1 0.896 and mIoU 0.886 in the optimal fusion scenario; MS-only F1 0.893; SAR-only F1 0.718; demonstrates robustness and parameter efficiency; outperforms baseline.

Conclusion: Sensor-flexible, efficient flood mapping model suitable for real-time disaster response with variable sensor availability; multi-modal pre-training offers operational advantages.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [42] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r introduces Geometric Consistency Regularization to train regression-based camera pose networks, achieving near-correspondence-level accuracy with the speed of regression by using a training-time consistency loss derived from dense 3D-2D correspondences and weighted RANSAC, without requiring inference-time geometric solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Registration-based pose methods offer high accuracy but are slow; regression-based methods are fast but underperform due to geometric inconsistencies and lack of geometric constraints. The abstract identifies a ceiling in accuracy for regression models and aims to bridge the gap to correspondence-based approaches like MASt3R while preserving ReLoc3R’s speed.

Method: During training, GeLoc3r uses ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them with a FusionTransformer to learn correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. A consistency loss is formed to transfer geometric knowledge to the regression network. At test time, only the enhanced regression head is used, avoiding inference-time geometric solving.

Result: Empirically, GeLoc3r outperforms ReLoc3R on CO3Dv2 (AUC@5deg: 40.45% vs 34.85%, 16% relative), RealEstate10K (68.66% vs 66.70%), and MegaDepth1500 (50.45% vs 49.60%). It maintains fast regression-speed and closes the gap toward MASt3R’s accuracy.

Conclusion: Training-time geometric consistency regularization enables regression networks to internalize geometric constraints, achieving the speed of regression with accuracy approaching correspondence-based methods, representing a paradigm shift in neural camera geometry learning.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

### [43] [MMeViT: Multi-Modal ensemble ViT for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23044)
*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal deep-learning HAR system using IMU and RGB-D sensors monitors domiciliary upper-limb ADLs in stroke patients; a new dataset was collected; results reveal different clustering characteristics in patient data and the model shows label-consistent tendencies, with potential for rehab feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of rehabilitation resources for stroke patients and the inadequacy of existing HAR approaches (focused on non-disabled individuals and simple actions). Proposes a multimodal, deep-learning HAR solution tailored to stroke patients to enable remote monitoring and home-based rehabilitation.

Method: Collected a multimodal dataset using IMU sensors and an RGB-D camera. Designed a preprocessing pipeline and a multimodal deep-learning model (MMeViT) to process combined sensor data for action recognition. Analyzed clustering behavior and explored generalization across actions. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Result: Found that stroke patient action data exhibit less clear clustering than non-disabled data. The proposed model learns label tendencies even in data with weak clustering, suggesting robustness to ambiguous features. Demonstrated feasibility for remote monitoring and identified potential for future feedback/assessment in domiciliary rehabilitation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of multimodal deep-learning HAR for stroke patients in home settings and highlights opportunities to extend the model to provide rehabilitation feedback and assessment, pending broader action sets and clinical validation.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [44] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation-matching autoencoder to generate minimal, faithful explanations by masking input while preserving model predictions and activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for explanations that are concise, faithful to the model’s decision process, and interpretable by humans; avoid revealing extraneous input regions.

Method: Train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask m; explanation e = m ⊙ x. Optimize via multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence + cross-entropy to preserve top-1 label for image and explanation), mask priors (L1-area for minimality, binarization penalty, total variation for compactness), and abductive constraints for faithfulness and necessity.

Result: Produces small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions.

Conclusion: This approach yields faithful, minimalist explanations and demonstrates activation-aligned masking as a practical explanation method for pretrained classifiers.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A controllable, text-guided masking framework (Mask What Matters) for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language prompts to localize regions and apply differentiated masking, achieving better semantic alignment with lower masking ratios and improved cross-modality performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging suffers from scarce annotated data. Random high-ratio masking in self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) is inefficient and semantically misaligned. Region-aware methods often rely on heuristics or supervised signals, limiting transferability across tasks and modalities.

Method: Introduce Mask What Matters, a controllable, text-guided masking framework that uses vision-language models for prompt-based region localization to apply differentiated masking that emphasizes diagnostically relevant regions and reduces background redundancy, enabling semantically aligned self-supervised learning across modalities.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing MIM approaches (e.g., SparK) across brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray. Reported gains include +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP for detection, achieved with substantially lower masking ratios (e.g., 40% vs. 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable, text-driven masking facilitates semantically aligned self-supervised learning, improving representation learning and cross-task generalizability for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR uses frequency-decoupled fusion with WeKat, CPF, and MDFC to boost tiny aerial-object detection with fewer parameters, achieving state-of-the-art results on VisDrone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery have limited visual cues and global context is hard to model; existing methods suffer from delayed fusion and weak non-linear multi-scale modeling, creating a performance bottleneck.

Method: Propose FMC-DETR: Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone with cascaded wavelet transforms to enhance global low-frequency context while preserving detail, and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for adaptive non-linear multi-scale modeling; Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) to reduce redundancy and improve multi-scale feature interaction; Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) to unify spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on aerial-view benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters; on VisDrone, gains of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over baseline, demonstrating effectiveness in tiny object detection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages frequency-domain information and adaptive non-linear multi-scale modeling to improve tiny object detection in aerial imagery while maintaining parameter efficiency, suggesting strong potential for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

*Yutao Shen,Junkun Yuan,Toru Aonishi,Hideki Nakayama,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A baseline alignment study for image inpainting using direct preference optimization with public reward models; demonstrates robustness via ensemble of models, outperforming prior approaches without new data or architectural changes; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability and biases in reward-model–driven preference data and to establish a simple, robust baseline for alignment in image inpainting.

Method: Construct preference datasets from nine public reward models across two benchmarks and two baseline architectures; apply direct preference optimization for alignment; evaluate individual reward models, scaling trends, biases (brightness, composition, color), and ensemble performance; validate with standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluators.

Result: Most reward models produce valid reward scores for constructing preference data; preference data shows robust scaling trends; reward biases lead to reward hacking; ensemble of models mitigates biases and yields robust, generalizable results; alignment models outperform prior models without changing architectures or new datasets; code is open-sourced.

Conclusion: Provides a simple, solid baseline for preference alignment in image inpainting, highlighting the value of model ensemble to counteract reward-model biases and enabling strong performance without architectural or data changes.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is
open-sourced at: https://github.com/shenytzzz/Follow-Your-Preference.

*Ziyu Su,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Anil V. Parwani,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight 5x magnification foundation model for computational pathology trained via cross-magnification distillation from a 20x teacher, achieving near-state-of-the-art accuracy with significant speedups and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are too resource-intensive for clinical deployment in pathology; a lower-magnification, efficient model is needed that preserves diagnostic performance.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation from a 20x teacher to a 5x student, with dual-level knowledge transfer (global representations and local spatial token mapping); compact backbone; operates entirely at 5x; trained on 3.49 million public images; end-to-end training strategy to boost performance.

Result: Achieves diagnostic accuracy within 1% of larger foundation models; ~30x processing acceleration; 8.8 WSIs per minute; uses 11.3x fewer patches per WSI; robust cross-institution generalization; end-to-end training further improves performance toward large FMs.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation enables deploying foundation-model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments and could enable real-time pathology AI integration.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

### [49] [CoPatch: Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation by Leveraging Untapped Spatial Knowledge in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23098)
*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot RIS framework that enhances spatial reasoning in VLMs by enriching language with spatial context tokens and by extracting patch-level image features via a novel path in intermediate layers, fusing them into a CoMap for precise mask selection, achieving +2–7 mIoU without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational VLMs excel at image-text alignment but lack robust spatial understanding: language pipelines overlook contextual tokens; vision pipelines treat spatial layout similarly across images, reducing sensitivity to spatial structure. RIS requires precise localization based on language.

Method: Language: build hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. Vision: identify a path through intermediate layers to extract patch-level features that preserve spatial structure; fuse enhanced text and image features into a clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: Achieves significant gains in zero-shot RIS on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut, with improvements of about 2–7 mIoU without additional training.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that recovering and leveraging latent spatial knowledge in VLMs can substantially improve zero-shot RIS, suggesting new directions for exploiting internal components of VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial

inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in

*Emadeldeen Hamdan,Ahmet Enis Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform layers with multiplication-avoiding SRAM-based in-memory computing to cut multiplications by up to 52% while preserving accuracy in ResNet-18 across CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the arithmetic cost of deep neural networks, especially multiplications, for energy-constrained edge devices; existing approaches often target only parts of the network or in-memory acceleration in isolation, leaving room for further gains.

Method: Introduce HTMA-Net that uses Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers with internal convolutions implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations; selectively replace intermediate convolutions with HT-based transform layers integrated with MA-SRAM computing.

Result: Achieves up to 52% reduction in multiplications compared to baseline ResNet variants (ResNet-18, ResNet-20, ResNet-50) with comparable accuracy; reduces computational complexity and number of parameters; evaluated on ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and compared against regular, MF-only, and HT-only variants.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising direction for efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

### [52] [Towards Comprehensive Interactive Change Understanding in Remote Sensing: A Large-scale Dataset and Dual-granularity Enhanced VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23105)
*Junxiao Xue,Quan Deng,Xuecheng Wu,Kelu Yao,Xinyi Yin,Fei Yu,Wei Zhou,Yanfei Zhong,Yang Liu,Dingkang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new interactive multi-task dataset ChangeIMTI and a vision-guided VLM ChangeVG improve change understanding in bi-temporal remote sensing, achieving state-of-the-art on change captioning (S*m) and strong results across four tasks with ablations backing components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing change datasets lack deep understanding and cross-task interaction. There is a need for models that jointly handle captioning, counting, classification, and localization on bi-temporal RS images, guided by vision-language instructions.

Method: Construct ChangeIMTI with four tasks: change captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change localization. Propose ChangeVG, a dual-branch vision-guided module that fuses fine-grained spatial features with high-level semantic summarization; use these enriched representations as auxiliary prompts to guide large VLMs during instruction tuning (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) for hierarchical cross-modal learning.

Result: Experiments across four tasks show the method’s superiority. On change captioning, it outperforms Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the S*m metric. Ablation studies validate the importance of the proposed components.

Conclusion: The ChangeIMTI dataset and ChangeVG model advance RS change understanding by enabling multi-task instruction-tuning and effective cross-modal reasoning, with dual-granularity guidance proving beneficial for vision-language models.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified multistage diffusion framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling and a single Diffusion Transformer to enable end-to-end optimization across resolutions, achieving high fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation approaches face a trade-off between computation and fidelity. VAE-based methods suffer information loss and limited detail; pixel-space methods are computationally expensive; cascade/multi-stage models hinder end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Method: Introduce Conditional Dependent Coupling to decompose generation into interpolant trajectories across multiple stages, and model the entire process as a single unified Diffusion Transformer, eliminating disjoint modules and enabling end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the computation–fidelity trade-off, enabling end-to-end training and unified modeling with strong performance across resolutions.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

TL;DR: A self-supervised DINOv3-based framework for NCCT stroke analysis achieving strong benchmarks across segmentation, classification, and ASPECTS tasks on multiple datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCCT-based stroke diagnosis suffers from low contrast and noise. Leveraging self-supervised DINOv3 aims to learn robust feature representations without heavy labeling, enabling multiple analytical tasks.

Method: Utilize DINOv3 vision transformer to extract features from NCCT and apply them to infarct/hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke; normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH, SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS (≤6 vs >6). Evaluated on multiple public and private datasets; benchmarks established; code available at the cited GitHub repository.

Result: The study establishes strong benchmarks across the targeted tasks, demonstrating the potential of advanced self-supervised models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT. It also provides a critical analysis of advantages and current limitations of the approach.

Conclusion: DINOv3-based self-supervised representations show promise for rapid, automated stroke assessment from NCCT. While encouraging, the approach has current constraints that warrant further investigation to facilitate clinical deployment; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

TL;DR: Earth-Agent unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem to enable cross-modal, multi-step, quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning; introduces Earth-Bench with 248 tasks and 13,729 images; demonstrates effectiveness and potential over baselines; code/dataset to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with complex, multi-step EO tasks and tool use; agent-based methods are underdeveloped (RGB-only, shallow reasoning) and lack systematic evaluation.

Method: Proposes Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework unifying RGB and spectral EO data in an MCP-based tool ecosystem to dynamically invoke expert tools/models across modalities for complex tasks (e.g., geophysical parameter retrieval, spatiotemporal analysis). Introduces Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks over 13,729 images spanning spectrum, products, and RGB modalities, with a dual-level evaluation protocol (reasoning trajectories and final outcomes). Conducts experiments varying LLM backbones and comparing against general agent frameworks and MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent; shows improved cross-modal reasoning and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis; robust evaluation across backbones and baselines; supports released code/dataset.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, enabling scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM-based Earth observation applications; code and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

*Wenxuan Fang,Jiangwei Weng,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherCycle offers a unified unsupervised restoration framework for multi-weather images via bidirectional degradation-content translation. It uses lumina-chroma decomposition to separate degradation from content, a Lumina Degradation Guidance Module to inject luminance priors through frequency-domain modulation, and a Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization to enforce semantic consistency on hard samples. It achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods with strong generalization to complex degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised image restoration under diverse weather is challenging; current methods rely on task-specific priors and struggle to generalize across varied real-world conditions. A unified framework that can model multiple degradations without paired data is highly desirable.

Method: 1) Reformulate restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle. 2) Use lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content without explicit weather modeling. 3) Introduce Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) to learn luminance degradation priors from degraded image pools and inject them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation. 4) Incorporate Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) to identify hard samples (via a CLIP-based classifier) and enforce contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-weather datasets show WeatherCycle achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and generalizes well to complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle provides a scalable, unified unsupervised restoration framework that leverages decomposition, degradation guidance, and contrastive regularization to handle diverse weather degradations with strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense is a keypoint-driven generative framework that uses extremely sparse 3D keypoints as transmitted symbols to achieve ultra-low bitrate human video compression while enabling precise human vertex prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In bandwidth-constrained multimedia, achieving both ultra-low bitrate video and accurate geometry remains challenging due to the need to harmonize motion modeling, texture synthesis, and geometric consistency.

Method: A multi-task deep generative model conditioned on sparse 3D keypoints, learning dense motion and coherent textures; integrates a vertex predictor optimized jointly with video generation to align visual content with 3D geometry.

Result: Experiments show competitive compression performance against traditional/generative codecs and precise vertex prediction for downstream geometry tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense enables bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission and supports applications like real-time motion analysis and virtual human animation; suggests promising directions for low-bitrate generative video with geometry.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-based axle counting pipeline using YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection and YOLO for tires, with a novel TRAX Tracking Algorithm to associate tires to vehicles and track axle features across frames, reducing false positives and improving accuracy for long/occluded vehicles; aims to replace legacy roadside infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure planning. Challenges include dense traffic, occlusions, and long vehicles causing partial detections, limiting the effectiveness of previous methods.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline that uses YOLO-OBB to detect and categorize vehicles and YOLO to detect tires. Tires are associated with their parent vehicles to enable axle counting. TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm tracks axle-related features across frames to mitigate occlusions and partial detections, especially for longer vehicles.

Result: The method significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: This approach represents a scalable, AI-driven step toward replacing legacy roadside infrastructure with machine-vision based axle counting systems.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside

### [59] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM fine-tunes only the SAM mask decoder with two penalties to curb domain shift and overconfidence in brain MRI segmentation, yielding notable accuracy and calibration gains with modest training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs well on natural images but poorly under domain shift and produces overconfident predictions in medical volumes; a lightweight adaptation that preserves the frozen encoders is desirable for robust medical segmentation.

Method: Use a combined loss CalSAM consisting of a Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift and a Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize voxel-wise miscalibrated errors. Train only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.

Result: Cross-center/scanner-shift gains: BraTS Siemens→GE: DSC +7.4% relative (80.1% vs 74.6%), HD95 −26.9% (4.6 mm vs 6.3 mm), ECE −39.5% (5.2% vs 8.6%). ATLAS-C (motion): DSC +5.3% relative (75.9%), ECE −32.6% (5.8%). Ablations show FIP and CMP provide complementary gains (p<0.01); training-time overhead ≈15%.

Conclusion: CalSAM improves domain generalization and calibrated uncertainty for brain MRI segmentation while retaining the computational benefits of a frozen encoder, offering a lightweight yet effective adaptation of SAM to medical imaging.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised online 3D instance segmentation method that uses synthetic sequence generation, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic weighting to surpass UNIT on major datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation suffers from lack of diversity, rigid sampling, and reliance on noisy pseudo-labels; need richer training distributions and better temporal modeling.

Method: 1) Generate synthetic point cloud sequences to diversify training without labels or simulators. 2) Adopt flexible sampling across adjacent and distant frames to learn short- and long-range temporal dependencies. 3) Apply a dynamic-weighting loss that emphasizes confident, informative samples to improve robustness. 4) Train on real LiDAR sequences and evaluate on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, PandaSet.

Result: Consistent improvement over UNIT and other unsupervised baselines in segmentation accuracy and temporal association robustness across SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, PandaSet.

Conclusion: Synthetic sequence generation plus flexible temporal sampling and dynamic loss effectively enhances unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation, enabling better generalization without labeled data; code will be released.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A black-box, universal adversarial patch (GaP) for face recognition that uses a Gaussian blob-based forehead patch, optimized via a zero-order greedy search with a surrogate model; requires ~10k queries, achieves high success in digital and physical tests, and transfers to an unseen model, revealing strong transferable vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations; existing attacks are often digital-only or white-box. This work targets a practical, black-box, physical-world threat with transferable impact, emphasizing real-world security risks for FR deployments.

Method: Construct a symmetric, grayscale forehead patch by iteratively adding Gaussian blobs. Use a zero-order, greedy optimization guided solely by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximize identity degradation, forming a universal patch; the patch is optimized in a black-box, query-efficient manner.

Result: The GaP patch achieves a high attack success rate in both digital and real-world physical tests with about 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, and transfers to an unseen FaceNet model, demonstrating strong transferability.

Conclusion: The study reveals a practical and severe vulnerability in FR systems, showing that robust, transferable adversarial patches can be crafted with limited target-system knowledge, underscoring the need for stronger defenses against black-box, transferable attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for
studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However,
real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low
signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We
propose UltraUNet, a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture optimized for
real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet
incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight
Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability,
and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational
overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific
augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets
demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and
MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet
provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics,
and analysis of speech motor disorders.

### [63] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI) offers a progressive sparse inversion for Vision Transformers that detaches the most important patches while letting others evolve, yielding up to 10x speedups over Dense Model Inversion and 2x over Sparse Model Inversion, with accuracy surpassing SMI and matching DMI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs make model inversion computationally expensive due to self-attention. Prior Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) prunes patches, but the paper argues that discarding patches is counterproductive because even random patches can acquire knowledge through continued inversion. The goal is to improve efficiency without sacrificing transferability of both class-agnostic and class-specific features.

Method: Incrementally detach the most informative patches during the inversion process to form sparse synthetic images, while keeping remaining patches evolving for future selection. This progressive ‘Re-Birth’ strategy balances the growth of class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching DMI performance.

Conclusion: Discarding patches prematurely during inversion is inefficient and harms knowledge transfer. A progressive re-birth approach that gradually detaches patches yields significant efficiency gains without sacrificing, and often improving, the quality of the inverted inputs.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

### [64] [Self-Consistency as a Free Lunch: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23236)
*Mingfei Han,Haihong Hao,Jinxing Zhou,Zhihui Li,Yuhui Zheng,Xueqing Deng,Linjie Yang,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-consistency based data curation framework uses long-form model responses and short binary answers to generate preference data, reducing hallucinations in vision-language models without human annotations or external supervision, while preserving instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details; existing fixes rely on annotated data or external supervision. This work seeks a scalable, self-supervised approach by leveraging the model's own consistency signals to curate training data.

Method: A self-reflection pipeline compares detailed model outputs to concise binary answers. Inconsistencies are used to generate training preferences. The method relies solely on unlabeled data and self-consistency, avoiding human or external supervision to curate high-quality training data.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability across AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench. The approach also preserves instruction-following ability, with boosted performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: Self-consistency-based data curation can effectively reduce hallucinations without external supervision, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for improving reliability in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

### [65] [TATTOO: Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recOmmendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23242)
*Yuntian Wu,Xiaonan Hu,Ziqi Zhou,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free, aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation (TATTOO) leverages Multimodal LLMs to generate target-item descriptions and an aesthetic profile, fusing visual and textual cues through a dynamic entropy-gated fusion to rank items in a shared embedding space, achieving SOTA performance on Aesthetic-100 and strong zero-shot retrieval on Polyvore without labeled training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on expensive task-specific labeled data and training, while explicitly guiding recommendations with human-like aesthetics; exploit the capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for end-to-end, training-free pipeline.

Method: 1) Use MLLMs to generate a target-item description. 2) Use an aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill outfit images into a structured aesthetics vector (color, style, occasion, season, material, balance). 3) Fuse visual summary, textual description, and aesthetics vectors via a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism into a shared embedding space. 4) Rank candidate items by similarity; evaluate on Aesthetic-100 and Polyvore for zero-shot retrieval.

Result: On Aesthetic-100, TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods; on Polyvore, demonstrates strong zero-shot retrieval capability in a training-free setting.

Conclusion: A training-free, aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation framework is viable and effective, reducing data requirements while maintaining top performance, and illustrating a practical use of MLLMs for multimodal recommendation tasks.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

*Kaili Wang,Leonardo Ravaglia,Roberto Longo,Lore Goetschalckx,David Van Hamme,Julie Moeyersoms,Ben Stoffelen,Tom De Schepper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal RGB-to-thermal translation framework using Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) to produce diverse, realistic thermal images for ADAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging in ADAS suffers from limited datasets and poor representation in driving simulators; there is demand for realistic, varied thermal data to improve perception in low-light and harsh weather.

Method: A multi-modal translation framework that extends AdaIN with CoAdaIN, which adapts styles to individual image components rather than applying a global style, enabling one-to-many RGB-to-thermal translations.

Result: Demonstrates that CoAdaIN yields more realistic and diverse thermal translations compared to global-style methods.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enhances one-to-many RGB-to-thermal translation for ADAS applications, potentially improving perception in challenging driving conditions; manuscript accepted for IEEE Sensors Conference 2024 (final published version: IEEE Sensors 2024).

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper
published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is

TL;DR: Graph-spectral HAR from LiDAR frames using epsilon-graphs; compact, interpretable features yield strong accuracy and privacy advantages vs. deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving HAR using LiDAR point clouds; robust to illumination and avoids camera-based privacy concerns and heavy end-to-end models.

Method: For each LiDAR frame, construct an epsilon proximity graph; compute Laplacian spectrum; use eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors as pose descriptors; derive temporal statistics over sliding windows; classify with SVM and Random Forests.

Result: On MM-Fi (40 subjects, 27 activities) under subject-independent protocol: 13-class rehabilitation subset achieves 94.4% accuracy; all 27 activities achieve 90.3%;>skeleton-based baselines on MM-Fi.

Conclusion: Presents a compact, interpretable feature set derived from point-cloud geometry, providing accurate and efficient HAR as an alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

### [68] [OracleGS: Grounding Generative Priors for Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23258)
*Atakan Topaloglu,Kunyi Li,Michael Niemeyer,Nassir Navab,A. Murat Tekalp,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A propose-and-validate framework (OracleGS) reconciles generative priors with regressive fidelity for sparse-view Gaussian Splatting by using a 3D-aware diffusion model to propose views and an MVS-based oracle to validate 3D uncertainty, guiding an uncertainty-weighted optimization and improving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to geometric ambiguity. Regressive models are faithful but incomplete, while generative models complete scenes but can introduce structural inconsistencies. A framework that balances these aspects is needed.

Method: 1) Use a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views and propose a complete scene. 2) Use a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate 3D uncertainties of generated views via attention maps, identifying well-supported vs uncertain regions. 3) Use the resulting uncertainty signal to drive an uncertainty-weighted loss that optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting model, conditioning the generative prior on multi-view evidence.

Result: The method filters hallucinations by leveraging multi-view evidence, enabling plausible completions in under-constrained regions, and achieves superior performance compared to prior work on Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity by coupling a 3D-aware diffusion prior with MVS-based uncertainty validation, yielding improved geometric consistency and fidelity in sparse-view neural rendering.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution (1 km) multimodal deep learning framework for regional monsoon rainfall classification in India using 7 geospatial modalities and an attention-guided U-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results and providing a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is critical for agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning in India but hindered by sparse observations and strong regional variability.

Method: Curates a 1 km dataset for five Indian states for June-September 2024, integrates land surface temperature, NDVI, soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, land use; uses an attention-guided U-Net; incorporates temporal and cross-modal attention; trains with focal and dice losses to address rainfall class imbalance.

Result: Outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning approaches, especially for extreme rainfall categories; provides a scalable framework, a benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting and geospatial AI in India.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable framework and benchmark for high-resolution regional monsoon forecasting with potential applications in climate resilience and geospatial AI in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

TL;DR: SynDoc proposes a hybrid discriminative-generative framework for domain-specific VRDU, leveraging synthetic data, adaptive instruction tuning, and recursive inference to improve robust, scalable key information extraction in regulated domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs (LLMs/MLLMs) suffer from hallucinations, limited domain adaptation, and costly fine-tuning when applied to visually rich documents in medicine, finance, and materials science.

Method: A hybrid framework combining discriminative and generative models with a synthetic data generation workflow (structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation), adaptive instruction tuning for the discriminative model, and a recursive inferencing mechanism that iteratively refines outputs from both models.

Result: Demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding in domain-specific VRDU, bridging domain-specific adaptation with general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: SynDoc offers a scalable, practical approach to domain-specific VRDU by integrating synthetic data, adaptive instruction tuning, and recursive inference to improve extraction accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

*Rohit Chowdhury,Aniruddha Bala,Rohan Jaiswal,Siddharth Roheda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an attention-suppressing adversarial attack that perturbs images to disrupt motion synthesis in image-to-video models, producing stand-still videos while preserving image semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of image-to-video models enabling deceptive or malicious video content, and to extend defenses beyond image immunization to block motion.

Method: Craft adversarial perturbations that suppress the model's attention mechanism, thereby preventing motion synthesis while retaining semantic fidelity of the input image.

Result: Immunized images yield stand-still or near-static videos; experiments show strong protection against motion synthesis and highlight attention-targeted attacks as a promising defensive direction.

Conclusion: Attention-focused adversarial defenses can effectively block motion generation in I2V systems, representing a proactive protection strategy against misuse.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-based defocus blur map is proposed as a robust, interpretable cue for detecting synthetic/deepfake images, supported by three feature analyses and experimental validation; the implementation is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, there is a need for interpretable, generalizable forensic signals. Defocus blur encodes depth-of-field inconsistencies that are hard to fake accurately in synthetic images.

Method: Compute a defocus blur map from images to capture depth-dependent DoF characteristics and use it as a discriminative feature for deepfake detection. The approach is complemented by three in-depth feature analyses to support interpretability and relies on a detection pipeline with accompanying interpretability tools.

Result: Defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for distinguishing synthetic images from real ones; experimental results demonstrate robustness and generalizability across AI-generated content.

Conclusion: The proposed defocus-based framework contributes to media forensics by offering a physically grounded, interpretable detector for synthetic imagery, with code publicly available at the referenced repository.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-SPK uses a diffusion model conditioned on ETFI to reconstruct low-light spike camera data, addressing noise and sparsity; it introduces a new benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce asynchronous spike streams with high temporal resolution, but in low-light/high-speed conditions the data is noisy and sparse, making reconstruction difficult. Existing methods struggle without strong priors; there is a need for generative-prior-based reconstruction and a reliable benchmark.

Method: Introduce ETFI (Enhanced Texture From Inter-spike Interval) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Use ETFI as conditioning input for ControlNet to generate high-speed scenes via a diffusion model. Add an ETFI-based feature fusion module to improve generation quality. Establish the first bona fide benchmark for low-light spike stream reconstruction.

Result: Empirical results show Diff-SPK surpasses existing reconstruction datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. Demonstrates superior performance on real low-light spike streams.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK provides an effective diffusion-based reconstruction framework for low-light spike streams by leveraging ETFI conditioning and feature fusion, and introduces a valuable benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

*Hao Liu,Yongjie Zheng,Yuhan Kang,Mingyang Zhang,Maoguo Gong,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-guided fusion framework (BDGF) balances modalities in multimodal remote sensing, using diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network (CNN, Mamba, Transformer) with attention and mutual learning, achieving state-of-the-art land-cover classification on four datasets; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training multimodal diffusion models can cause modality imbalance and underutilization of complementary information. There is a need to leverage diffusion-derived features to enable diverse, complementary feature extraction across modalities in land-cover classification.

Method: Introduce adaptive modality masking to balance diffusion outputs; use diffusion features to hierarchically guide feature extraction across CNN, Mamba, and Transformer branches via feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention; employ a mutual learning strategy to align probability entropy and feature similarity across subnetworks.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets show that BDGF achieves superior classification performance compared to baselines, validating the effectiveness of modality balancing and diffusion-guided fusion.

Conclusion: BDGF effectively mitigates modality imbalance in multimodal diffusion models and leverages diffusion-derived features to guide diverse feature extraction, leading to improved land-cover classification in multimodal remote sensing.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method

### [75] [Seeing Symbols, Missing Cultures: Probing Vision-Language Models' Reasoning on Fire Imagery and Cultural Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23311)
*Haorui Yu,Qiufeng Yi,Yijia Chu,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diagnostic framework reveals cultural biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs): models rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. Western festivals are recognized well, while underrepresented cultures are often mislabeled or given vague labels, and emergencies can be misclassified as celebrations. This underscores risks of symbolic shortcuts and calls for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy to ensure interpretable, fair multimodal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often claim cultural competence but may lean on superficial cues. This study aims to systematically probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery to uncover biases, ensure safer deployment, and push toward evaluations that capture true cultural understanding rather than pattern shortcuts.

Method: Develop a diagnostic framework combining classification and explanation analysis. Test multiple VLMs on image sets including Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes. Assess accuracy, label quality, and the faithfulness/usefulness of explanations, focusing on systematic biases and risk of misclassification.

Result: Models show systematic biases: strong performance on prominent Western festivals but struggles with underrepresented cultural events, yielding vague labels or misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. Findings reveal reliance on symbolic shortcuts rather than genuine cultural understanding, highlighting risks in evaluation that focus only on accuracy.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for cultural evaluation beyond standard accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable, fair multimodal systems. Calls for diverse, culturally representative data, robust evaluation of reasoning, and safeguards against dangerous misclassifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

*Siheng Wang,Zhengdao Li,Yanshu Li,Canran Xiao,Haibo Zhan,Zhengtao Yao,Xuzhi Zhang,Jiale Kang,Linshan Li,Weiming Liu,Zhikang Dong,Jifeng Shen,Junhao Dong,Qiang Sun,Piotr Koniusz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD unifies robustness and open-world diversity via a two-stage curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning, with EMA to prevent forgetting; achieves strong results on FLIR, OV-COCO, OV-LVIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a trade-off between robustness under adverse conditions and generalization to unseen/open-set categories in object detection; existing methods excel in one but not both.

Method: Two-stage curriculum: Stage1 pretraining with RGB-T data to boost robustness; Stage2 vision-language alignment to improve generalization across unseen categories; EMA mechanism to bound parameter lag and preserve pre-stage performance, aiming to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Empirical results on FLIR, OV-COCO, OV-LVIS show competitive performance across robustness and open-world evaluation; code released.

Conclusion: C3-OWD demonstrates that combining modality-driven robustness and cross-modal generalization with controlled forgetting yields balanced performance; EMA theory provides a bound on forgetting.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

### [77] [Spatial-Spectral Binarized Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multi-spectral Images Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23321)
*Yizhen Jiang,Mengting Ma,Anqi Zhu,Xiaowen Ma,Jiaxin Li,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A specialized binary network, S2BNet, for pan-sharpening uses Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) to mitigate spectral distortion and capture multi-scale spatial features, achieving high efficiency with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational complexity of deep pan-sharpening on resource-constrained devices. Binarization often causes spectral distortion and poor handling of multi-scale/anisotropic spatial features; the paper aims to address these issues.

Method: Introduce S2B-Conv consisting of SRM, which uses an affine transformation with dynamically learned scale and bias, and GSFA, which randomly selects frequencies and angles within a preset range. Stack multiple S2B-Conv to form the S2BNet for pan-sharpening.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening with promising performance.

Conclusion: S2BNet demonstrates feasibility of binarized pan-sharpening for remote sensing pan-sharpening, addressing spectral distortion and contour degradation, with potential for deployment on resource-limited devices; future work may explore further improvements and generalization.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

### [78] [Decoupling Reasoning and Perception: An LLM-LMM Framework for Faithful Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23322)
*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning from perception in LMMs, using an LLM to direct targeted visual queries to a LMM VQA engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that extended multimodal reasoning chains in LMMs drift from visual grounding, causing visually unfounded conclusions, by keeping perception and reasoning separate in a simple plug-and-play setup without retraining.

Method: An LLM performs high-level reasoning and governs the process by strategically querying a LMM to obtain only the visual information needed for its logical chain. The LMM acts solely as a visual question-answering engine, supplying perceptual details on demand. The system requires no additional training or architectural changes.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show a significant reduction in visually unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free visual-reasoning pipeline effectively governs visual reasoning, offering a simple, plug-and-play solution that preserves grounding to visual content and improves reasoning quality.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

*Kaile Du,Zihan Ye,Junzhou Xie,Fan Lyu,Yixi Shen,Yuyang Li,Miaoxuan Zhu,Fuyuan Hu,Ling Shao,Guangcan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) is a replay-free, parameter-efficient prompt-based framework for multi-label class-incremental learning that tackles semantic confusion via class-specific positive/negative prompts and reduces false positives with Progressive Confidence Decoupling; it freezes past prompts and uses interlayer prompting, achieving state-of-the-art results (>80% mAP, >70% F1) on MS-COCO B40-C10 and strong results on PASCAL VOC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompts in multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) suffer from two core issues: semantic confusion due to co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling. A replay-free, parameter-efficient approach that disentangles semantics and suppresses false positives is needed.

Method: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) assigns class-specific positive and negative prompts to disentangle semantics between labels. Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) is a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency.

Result: DDP consistently outperforms prior methods on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, and is the first replay-free MLCIL method to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP provides an effective, replay-free and parameter-efficient solution for MLCIL by decoupling semantics and confidence. Frozen prompts serve as knowledge anchors while interlayer prompting improves efficiency, with strong empirical validation on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

### [80] [LRPO: Enhancing Blind Face Restoration through Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23339)
*Bin Wu,Yahui Liu,Chi Zhang,Yao Zhao,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRPO introduces online reinforcement learning to blind face restoration (BFR) to improve restoration quality, balancing perceptual quality and fidelity with three strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration struggles with a large solution space, leading to artifacts, missing details, and identity ambiguity. While reinforcement learning can leverage rewards, naive RL may diverge from ground truth. This motivates designing an online RL framework with regularization and task-tailored rewards to improve fidelity and perceptual quality.

Method: Propose Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO), the first online RL approach for BFR. LRPO updates a policy network using rewards from sampled restoration candidates to increase the likelihood of high-quality outputs. To address fidelity vs perceptual quality, three strategies are employed: (1) a composite reward function tailored for face restoration assessment, (2) ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and (3) noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show that LRPO significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on BFR tasks.

Conclusion: LRPO successfully reconciles perceptual quality with fidelity in blind face restoration through online RL and targeted regularization, delivering strong empirical gains and SOTA performance.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentVLM is a large multimodal vision-language model for dental diagnosis that integrates seven 2D imaging modalities across 36 tasks, outperforming existing models and improving clinician performance and efficiency in a clinical study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for integrated multimodal AI in dentistry to support comprehensive clinical decision-making. Current models handle isolated tasks and often cannot match expert-level practice, contributing to access gaps and inefficiencies in primary dental care.

Method: Developed DentVLM using a large bilingual dataset (110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering pairs). It interprets seven 2D imaging modalities across 36 diagnostic tasks. Evaluated against leading models; included a clinical study with 25 dentists evaluating 1,946 patients and 3,105 QA pairs. Demonstrated integration into collaborative workflows and evaluated utility scenarios (home management, hospital diagnosis, multi-agent collaboration).

Result: DentVLM outperformed leading proprietary and open-source models by 19.6% in oral-disease accuracy and 27.9% in malocclusion accuracy. In a clinical study, it surpassed 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded 12 senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into workflows, junior dentists reached senior-level performance and overall diagnostic time decreased by 15–22%. It also showed promising performance in home-based, hospital-based, and multi-agent collaboration scenarios.

Conclusion: DentVLM demonstrates strong potential as a robust clinical decision-support tool to enhance primary dental care, reduce provider–patient disparities, and broaden access to dental expertise across diverse settings.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tree-structured RL sampling framework (Dynamic-TreeRPO) with dynamic noise and LayerTuning-RL improves T2I generation quality and efficiency by amortizing search costs and reformulating SFT as a weighted PRM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and excessive exploration in RL-enhanced flow-matching models for text-to-image generation, aiming to boost diversity and quality without extra compute.

Method: Introduce Dynamic-TreeRPO: a tree-structured sliding-window sampling with depth-varying noise; GRPO-guided optimization and constrained SDE sampling within the tree; share prefix paths to amortize trajectory search; integrate SFT with RL via LayerTuning-RL, modeling SFT loss as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) and coupling with dynamic clipping bounds.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward by 4.9%, 5.91%, and 8.66% respectively, while achieving ~50% training efficiency gains and improved semantic fidelity and human preference alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic-TreeRPO with LayerTuning-RL demonstrates that structured exploration and adaptive RL/SFT coupling can yield superior T2I generation quality and efficiency, highlighting the value of shared trajectory prefixes and dynamic noise strategies for robust search.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [83] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time uncertainty framework for pretrained medical image registration networks based on transformation equivariance, decomposing perturbation-based uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter; validated across four anatomical structures and two models, enabling risk-aware registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty methods for registration (Bayesian methods, ensembles, MC dropout) require architectural changes or retraining, limiting applicability to pretrained networks. There is a need for a universal, test-time uncertainty estimate compatible with any pretrained registration model to enable safer deployment.

Method: Leverage the transformation equivariance property of image registration. Apply spatial perturbations to inputs, analyze the variance of network predictions under perturbations, and derive a theoretical decomposition of perturbation-based uncertainty into two terms: intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic drift under perturbations).

Result: Uncertainty maps produced by the framework correlate with registration errors across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, lung) and multiple models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph). The method consistently highlights regions requiring caution, effectively turning any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool at test time.

Conclusion: The proposed test-time uncertainty framework enables safe deployment of pretrained registration networks by providing reliable, model-agnostic uncertainty estimates at inference time.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

### [84] [GRAPE: Let GPRO Supervise Query Rewriting by Ranking for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23370)
*Zhaohua Zhang,Jianhuan Zhuo,Muxi Chen,Chenchen Zhao,Wenyu Jiang,Tianwen Jiang,Mingyang Chen,Yu Tang,Qiuyong Xiao,Jihong Zhang,Zhixun Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement that uses grouped ranking-aware policy optimization to guide LLM-based query rewriting for CLIP-like retrievers, aligning queries with the retriever’s training distribution and avoiding score inflation. It improves retrieval under distribution shifts ( multilingual, long-form, multimodal ) by about 4.9% in Recall@10 across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-style retrievers struggle when query/input distributions differ from the training corpus. LLM-based query rewriting lacks supervision signals to match the retriever distribution, and naive fine-tuning can inflate scores. A ranking-aware optimization with supervision signals is needed to bridge distributional gaps without distorting scoring.

Method: Introduce GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play approach that uses ranking signals to guide LLM-based query rewriting. It leverages a corpus-relative ranking-based reward to align optimization with ranking metrics and suppress score inflation. GRAPE employs GRPO to transform queries into forms better aligned with the retriever’s training distribution across length, multilingual, and modality shifts.

Result: GRAPE consistently improves retrieval under distributional shifts, achieving an average Recall@10 improvement of 4.9% across multilingual (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length (Wikipedia), and multimodal (CIRR) benchmarks. Code is released at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: GRAPE provides a practical, effective enhancement for CLIP-like retrieval systems facing distribution shifts by rewriting queries with ranking-aware supervision, mitigating score inflation, and delivering reliable gains without retraining the retriever.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr introduces a cascaded point cloud completion framework with knowledge distillation, achieving improved global shape recovery and detail preservation, outperforming baselines on ShapeNet-55.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete real-world point clouds due to limited sensor resolution, viewpoints, occlusions, and noise necessitate effective completion methods that recover global shape and missing regions.

Method: A two-stage cascaded network: Shape Reconstruction generates auxiliary information; Fused Completion leverages this information plus knowledge distillation from a teacher model trained on denser point clouds to produce the final completed point cloud, enhancing global context and local detail.

Result: CasPoinTr demonstrates superior shape recovery and detail preservation over existing methods on ShapeNet-55 across different difficulty settings.

Conclusion: Cascaded architecture combined with distillation effectively bridges incomplete inputs and complete targets by improving global shape estimation and refining local details.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation framework that uses unannotated RGB-D sequences to transfer 2D pose priors to 3D, via self-supervision and cross-modality learning, achieving competitive results with fully supervised methods and improved with large-scale unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D HPE typically requires labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations and multi-view calibration. This work aims to leverage abundant 2D pose data and readily available RGB-D sequences to bridge 2D and 3D domains without heavy labeling, calibration, or synthetic-to-real gaps.

Method: Train on unannotated single-view RGB-D data. Use off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators as weak supervision for a point-cloud network. Enforce spatial-temporal constraints (body symmetry, joint motion), apply 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interactions. Use the point-cloud network's 3D HPE as pseudo ground truth to perform anchor-to-joint 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks. Leverage RGB, depth, and point cloud data and augment with large unlabeled datasets.

Result: On CMU Panoptic and ITOP, UniPose achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) further improves robustness, and the proposed 3D lifting method yields state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates effective weakly supervised 3D HPE by propagating 2D pose priors across modalities, reducing labeling/calibration requirements while maintaining competitive or superior performance, especially when leveraging additional unlabeled data.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

### [87] [Generative Modeling of Shape-Dependent Self-Contact Human Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23393)
*Takehiko Ohkawa,Jihyun Lee,Shunsuke Saito,Jason Saragih,Fabian Prado,Yichen Xu,Shoou-I Yu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato,Takaaki Shiratori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shapes (383K poses from 130 subjects), and a shape-conditioned self-contact prior built with a body-part–wise latent diffusion model with self-attention, which is integrated into single-view pose estimation to enforce contact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling self-contact requires accurate body geometry; existing datasets lack pose diversity and precise body shapes, hindering analysis of the relationship between self-contact poses and body shapes.

Method: Construct Goliath-SC with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects and precise shape registration; develop a generative self-contact prior conditioned on body shape parameters using a body-part–wise latent diffusion model with self-attention; integrate this prior into a single-view pose estimation pipeline and refine poses to satisfy contact constraints.

Result: Experiments show that conditioning on body shape is essential for modeling the self-contact pose distribution and improves the performance of single-view pose estimation in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Shape-aware priors are crucial for accurate self-contact modeling; the dataset enables robust analysis of pose–shape interactions, and diffusion-based, shape-conditioned priors effectively support pose estimation under self-contact.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

*Ziyue Zhu,Zhanqian Wu,Zhenxin Zhu,Lijun Zhou,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wan,Kun Ma,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye,Jin Xie,jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 4D driving-scene generation framework, WorldSplat, combines a 4D-aware latent diffusion model to generate pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians and a video diffusion refinement to produce temporally and spatially consistent multi-view driving videos, bridging generative and reconstructive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving-scene pipelines struggle to provide both high-quality, novel-view synthesis (NVS) and temporally consistent 4D representations. Generative methods lack robust 3D consistency and reconstruction-based methods lack generation capabilities, hindering scalable, controllable data for autonomous driving.

Method: WorldSplat introduces a two-stage feed-forward approach: (i) a 4D-aware latent diffusion model that fuses multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians for the scene; (ii) an enhanced video diffusion model that refines the novel-view videos rendered from these Gaussians, yielding temporally and spatially coherent multi-track driving videos.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WorldSplat generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel-view driving videos, showing effective NVS and scalable data generation.

Conclusion: WorldSplat effectively bridges generative and reconstructive capabilities for driving scenes, providing a scalable, high-quality 4D driving-video synthesis framework with strong 3D consistency and novel-view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

TL;DR: An improved YOLO-based fracture detector, Fracture-YOLO, with CRSelector and ScA heads, achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing +4 mAP50 and +3 mAP50-95 over a baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical fracture assessment relies on expert visual inspection; while YOLO-based detectors have improved speed and accuracy, performance can be further enhanced by leveraging global texture cues and multi-scale feature weighting to handle variable fracture appearances.

Method: Introduce Fracture-YOLO by integrating CRSelector (global texture-guided attention on fracture regions) and ScA (scale-aware feature weighting) into a YOLO framework, and evaluate against a baseline on fracture datasets using standard AP/mAP metrics.

Result: Fracture-YOLO achieves significant gains over the baseline, with mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3 points, surpassing the baseline and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CRSelector and ScA effectively enhance fracture detection, improving accuracy and robustness across scales; this approach shows potential for faster, more reliable clinical fracture diagnosis.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with
mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: FracDetNet proposes Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC) to improve fracture detection in medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art results on GRAZPEDWRI-DX with notable mAP gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fracture detection is challenging due to subtle and morphologically diverse fractures, variability in imaging angles, and suboptimal image quality, which hinder clinical diagnostic efficiency.

Method: Introduce Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) to capture both local details and global context through combined global and local attention, and incorporate Multi-scale Calibration (MC) to adaptively refine feature representations for better detection. Evaluated on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset with standard object-detection metrics.

Result: FracDetNet achieves a mAP50-95 of 40.0%, a 7.5 percentage point improvement over the baseline. mAP50 reaches 63.9%, up by 4.2 percentage points, with fracture-specific detection accuracy improved by 2.9%.

Conclusion: The proposed DFA and MC modules enable robust fracture detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset and improving both overall and fracture-specific detection metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches
63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific

### [91] [SPIKE-RL: Video-LLMs meet Bayesian Surprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23433)
*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE introduces a Bayesian-surprise-based frame-sampling framework for Video-LLMs, plus SPIKE-RL to optimize belief hypotheses; both guide surprise-weighted frame selection to capture critical moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform frame sampling in Video-LLMs often misses pivotal moments that shape a video's narrative. By quantifying Bayesian Surprise, the approach aims to detect moments where new visual evidence challenges prior beliefs, enabling more informative sampling and robust video understanding.

Method: Define Bayesian Surprise as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in a video stream; identify moments where new evidence conflicts with prior beliefs (SPIKE). Extend with SPIKE-RL (using GRPO) to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the video caption. Use surprise-weighted frame sampling that allocates more frames to surprising moments, query-agnostic.

Result: SPIKE localizes surprise in videos and correlates strongly with human surprise on FunQA (positive) and Oops! (negative) benchmarks. SPIKE-RL improves belief hypotheses via GRPO and, together with surprise-weighted sampling, yields consistent gains across five downstream benchmarks compared to uniform sampling.

Conclusion: Tracking beliefs and registering surprise enables Video-LLMs to revise understanding in light of new evidence, leading to more robust video understanding and improved downstream performance.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

*Mohammed Alsakabi,Wael Mobeirek,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neuron-specific, Nyquist-informed frequency multipliers for periodic activations in SIREN/FINER reduce feature redundancy and improve INR reconstruction without extra depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current periodic INRs suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressiveness.

Method: Introduce FM-SIREN and FM-FINER by assigning neuron-specific frequency multipliers inspired by Discrete Sine Transform, achieving frequency diversity without extra hyperparameters or depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by about 50% and improves signal reconstruction across 1D audio, 2D images, 3D shapes, and NeRFs, while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: A simple, principled modification that enhances INR expressiveness across tasks without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

### [93] [FoR-SALE: Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23452)
*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE extends the SLD framework to incorporate Frame of Reference for spatial editing in text-to-image generation. It aligns language with vision via a unified perspective and achieves single-round corrections that improve T2I performance by up to 5.3% on two FoR-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal T2I models struggle with spatial descriptions from non-camera viewpoints. Frame of Reference is a missing but essential dimension for accurate spatial understanding. The work aims to close the gap by enabling unified perception and editing based on FoR.

Method: Extend Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) into FoR-SALE. Use vision modules to extract image spatial configuration and map spatial expressions to a camera perspective. Evaluate alignment between language and vision and generate required edits when misalignment is detected. Apply novel latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth. Validate on two FoR-design benchmarks.

Result: Demonstrates up to 5.3% improvement over state-of-the-art T2I models with a single round of correction on two FoR-oriented benchmarks.

Conclusion: FoR-SALE effectively integrates Frame of Reference into diffusion-based T2I editing, enabling efficient, one-shot alignment of spatial language and vision and improving generation quality in non-camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

### [94] [3DPCNet: Pose Canonicalization for Robust Viewpoint-Invariant 3D Kinematic Analysis from Monocular RGB cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23455)
*Tharindu Ekanayake,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet is a compact, estimator-agnostic module that canonicalizes monocular 3D poses into a body-centered frame by predicting a 6D rotation mapped to SO(3), using a hybrid GCN+Transformer with gated cross-attention; trained self-supervised on MM-Fi with synthetic rotations, it dramatically improves rotation accuracy and MPJPE and aligns acceleration signals with IMU data, enabling consistent motion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose outputs are camera-centered and view-dependent, hindering cross-study comparability and downstream physiologic analysis. A body-centered canonical frame improves consistency, enables fairer comparisons, and better cross-modal validation with IMUs.

Method: A hybrid encoder that fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network with global context from a transformer via gated cross-attention. The model predicts a continuous 6D rotation, mapped to an SO(3) matrix, to align the pose. Training is self-supervised on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses with a composite loss for rotation accuracy and pose reconstruction.

Result: On MM-Fi, mean rotation error drops from over 20 degrees to 3.4 degrees and MPJPE from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative results on TotalCapture show acceleration signals from video align well with ground-truth IMU data, indicating successful removal of viewpoint variability.

Conclusion: 3DPCNet provides a compact, estimator-agnostic module that enforces a body-centered canonical pose representation, enabling more consistent, physically plausible motion analysis and better cross-modal alignment with IMU data.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-grained test-time optimization framework for text-to-image generation that decomposes prompts into semantic concepts and uses a concept-level CLIP to improve compositional faithfulness, guided by an iterative prompt refinement loop with an LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models often misrender complex prompts. Global similarity scores in test-time optimization fail to ensure faithful rendering of individual objects/attributes; a compositional, concept-aware approach can improve faithfulness.

Method: Decompose the input prompt into semantic concepts; use a fine-grained CLIP variant to measure concept-level alignment; provide detailed feedback on missing/incorrect concepts; feed feedback into an iterative prompt refinement loop where an LLM proposes improved prompts; evaluate on DrawBench and CompBench with human judgments.

Result: The approach significantly improves concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness compared with standard test-time optimization and the base T2I model.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, concept-level feedback enables better compositional faithfulness in T2I generation, demonstrating the value of integrating concept-aware evaluation with iterative prompt refinement; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFAS-DANet is a domain-adaptive, multi-modal face anti-spoofing framework that handles missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation by substituting features from available modalities, using cross-modal uncertainty for pseudo-labels, and adapting loss weights during training; it achieves state-of-the-art results under DA. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal FAS often relies on complete modality inputs and fails to adapt to unseen attacks in new target domains. While domain adaptation has been explored for single-modal FAS, it remains underexplored for multi-modal FAS, and practical DA must handle missing modalities, label noise, and unstable adaptation.

Method: MFAS-DANet introduces: (1) missing modality compensation by extracting complementary features from other modalities to substitute or enrich missing ones; (2) robust pseudo-labels using prediction uncertainty across modalities to reduce label noise during adaptation; (3) an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that decreases loss during unstable adaptation and increases it during stable phases to prevent model degradation, all within a DA framework for multi-modal FAS.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance for multi-modal FAS under domain adaptation settings.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet effectively addresses three core challenges in multi-modal FAS under DA—missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation—leading to superior performance and robust cross-domain spoof detection.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

*Shourya Verma,Mengbo Wang,Nadia Atallah Lanman,Ananth Grama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast, knowledge-distillation-based image restoration method (RestoRect) that uses latent rectified flow to simulate teacher features for lightweight students, combining Retinex-based physics with diffusion and color polarization; introduces a cross-architecture feature transfer via a Feature Layer Extraction loss; claims improved stability, speed, and restoration quality across 15 datasets and 4 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between high-quality restoration and practical speed by enabling lightweight models to emulate transformer-based teacher features. Static feature matching fails to capture dynamic, context-dependent features produced by modern transformers.

Method: RestoRect reformulates distillation as a generative process over latent-space trajectories using latent rectified flow. It fuses Retinex-based physics decomposition, learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. A Feature Layer Extraction loss enables cross-architecture, percentile-based outlier-robust alignment of transformer features.

Result: Empirically, the method yields better training stability, faster convergence and inference while maintaining or improving restoration quality across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks and evaluated on 8 metrics.

Conclusion: RestoRect offers a practical distillation framework that captures dynamic transformer feature generation via latent trajectories, enabling fast yet high-quality restoration and generalizing across tasks and architectures. Potentially extendable to other vision domains where teacher-student dynamics are critical.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OriGS introduces orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting for high-quality 4D reconstruction from monocular videos, featuring a Global Orientation Field and Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian to model time-space-geometry-orientation, enabling region-specific deformations and achieving superior fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on simple, low-rank motion anchors (e.g., graph nodes or spline control points) and struggle to capture complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes. A global orientation-guided, high-dimensional representation is needed to accurately model both global motion intent and local dynamics.

Method: 1) Estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space-time to provide stable structural guidance. 2) Propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a probabilistic state. 3) Enable principled conditioned slicing to infer region-specific deformation aligned with the global motion, extending Gaussian Splatting to 4D dynamic scenes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of OriGS over mainstream methods on challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: OriGS delivers a stable, orientation-guided, hyper-dimensional representation for 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos, enabling accurate modeling of complex dynamics and improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

### [99] [Multi-modal Data Spectrum: Multi-modal Datasets are Multi-dimensional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23499)
*Divyam Madaan,Varshan Muhunthan,Kyunghyun Cho,Sumit Chopra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study quantifies intra- and inter-modality dependencies in 23 VQA benchmarks using multi-modal LLMs, revealing varying reliance on vision, text, and their interaction, with some benchmarks amplifying image-only biases; the work provides a quantitative framework to guide principled multi-modal benchmark design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intra-modality (within a modality) and inter-modality (between modalities and the task) dependencies shape multi-modal learning and benchmark evaluation, addressing gaps in characterizing these dependencies in current benchmarks.

Method: Performing a large-scale empirical study across 23 VQA benchmarks using multi-modal large language models to measure reliance on vision, question text, and their interaction; analyzing variation across benchmarks and model sizes.

Result: Dependencies vary across benchmarks and tasks; several benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only bias instead amplify image-only dependence; larger models tend to rely on intra-modal cues to achieve high performance, masking weaker multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Offers a quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets to enable principled benchmark design and evaluation, guiding future dataset construction to better assess true multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

### [100] [Enhancing Polyp Segmentation via Encoder Attention and Dynamic Kernel Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23502)
*Fatemeh Salahi Chashmi,Roya Sotoudeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Kernel with Encoder Attention and Unified Channel Adaptation improves polyp segmentation efficiency and accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art Dice/IoU on KvasirSEG and ClinicDB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse polyp shapes, sizes, and low-contrast boundaries; there is a need for architectures that integrate global context, flexible kernel refinement, and efficient decoding.

Method: Introduce a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism initialized by a global context from an Encoder Attention (EA) module; the EA aggregates multi-scale features from all encoder layers; unify channel adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages; extend the lesion-aware kernel framework with flexible, attention-driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design.

Result: The method outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB, achieving superior Dice and IoU scores; UCA reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with potential clinical and automated diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

*Akila Kadambi,Marco Iacoboni,Lisa Aziz-Zadeh,Srini Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActPLD introduces a benchmark to test action understanding in multimodal large language models using human point-light displays; current models show low performance, revealing gaps in action and spatiotemporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-light displays reveal minimal visual cues necessary for action understanding; evaluating ML models on such cues probes embodied and temporal reasoning abilities; existing models underperform, highlighting fundamental limitations.

Method: Create ActPLD benchmark with single-actor and social interaction PLDs; evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks.

Result: Models exhibit consistently low performance across tasks; significant gaps in action recognition and spatiotemporal understanding.

Conclusion: Need to improve how models represent and reason about sparse motion cues; this benchmark exposes key deficiencies and guides future work in embodied, temporal action understanding.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

TL;DR: Large-scale longitudinal study using radiomics and deep learning on 2,125 chest CTs from systemic sclerosis patients to predict mortality related to lung complications at 1, 3, and 5 years, achieving AUCs up to ~0.80.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systemic sclerosis-associated ILD carries high mortality; accurate early risk stratification via CT-based imaging biomarkers could guide surveillance and treatment decisions.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 2,125 CT scans from the Northwestern Scleroderma Registry. Mortality labels defined for 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals. Applied radiomics features and deep learning models (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer), pretrained and fine-tuned on the dataset; evaluated performance with AUC.

Result: AUCs reported as 0.769 (1-year), 0.801 (3-year), 0.709 (5-year) for mortality prediction. Three architectures were evaluated on the same dataset.

Conclusion: Radiomics and DL on chest CT show promise for early mortality risk stratification in SSc-ILD; supports imaging-based prognostication and warrants further validation and external testing to enable clinical adoption.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Weiheng Chai,Jiyang Wang,Sanjeda Akter,Senem Velipasalar Gursoy,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework improves confidence calibration and safety-critical detection in driver monitoring, outperforming low-resolution baselines on calibration and critical-event metrics, with a lightweight artifact detector to curb hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical driver monitoring demands reliable, well-calibrated confidence estimates; direct low-resolution training yields high accuracy but poor calibration, risking unsafe decisions.

Method: Develop a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that enhances calibration and critical-event precision-recall, plus a lightweight artifact detector (0.3M params, ~5.2 ms) to filter SR-induced hallucinations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art safety-centric metrics: ECE 5.8% (vs 6.2% LR baseline), AUPR for drowsiness 0.78 (vs 0.74), and precision-recall for phone use 0.74 (vs 0.71), with a fast, compact artifact detector.

Conclusion: LR-trained video models remain strong baselines, but the proposed adaptive SR framework advances reliability for safety-critical applications where calibrated confidence is essential.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

### [104] [OVSeg3R: Learn Open-vocabulary Instance Segmentation from 2D via 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23541)
*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R enables open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation by leveraging 2D open-vocabulary models and 3D reconstructions, introducing View-wise Instance Partition and 2D Boundary-aware Superpoints to generate supervision and preserve instance boundaries, achieving notable gains on ScanNet200 and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend 3D instance segmentation to open vocabulary while reducing annotation costs and handling partial supervision and geometric smoothing, leveraging cross-modal 2D-3D information.

Method: Utilizes reconstructed scenes from 2D videos; projects 2D instance masks into 3D via reconstruction correspondences to create per-view supervision; introduces View-wise Instance Partition to align predictions to views; creates 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoints by constraining geometry-based clustering with 2D masks.

Result: Outperforms previous methods by ~+7.1 mAP on novel classes and +2.3 mAP overall on ScanNet200; extends state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D model to open-vocabulary.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively bridges 2D open-vocabulary perception and 3D segmentation, narrowing tail-head gap and enabling robust open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation with reduced annotation effort.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly preferred over NeRF in real-world pipelines due to better efficiency, fidelity, and integration, with a survey mapping advantages, modalities, limitations, and a roadmap for adoption across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, photorealistic, and versatile 3D representations that work across diverse tasks (SLAM, telepresence, robotics, content creation). 3DGS offers explicit, efficient rendering and easier integration into hybrid systems, addressing limitations of NeRF-based methods.

Method: Systematic survey organized around unified research questions. It compares domain-specific pipelines, analyzes input modalities and domain constraints, and evaluates tradeoffs among photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computation. It culminates in a roadmap and identification of limitations and future directions.

Result: 3DGS provides a favorable balance of photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency, enabling rapid optimization and integration into a range of perception and rendering pipelines. The review demonstrates adoption across SLAM, teleoperation, robotics, and 3D content generation.

Conclusion: 3DGS is a promising direction for neural rendering in real and virtual environments. The survey offers guidance for leveraging neural rendering beyond image synthesis toward perception, interaction, and content creation, while outlining remaining challenges and opportunities.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning for pancreas part segmentation (head/body/tail) in MRI across seven institutions using 711 T1W and 726 T2W scans. Attention U-Net with FedAvg yields best results; introduces anatomically-informed loss; achieves clinically viable performance while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreas segmentation into head, body, and tail is clinically important due to regional disease patterns and morphological variability in MRI. Limited data and privacy constraints hinder centralized training, motivating a privacy-preserving FL approach across multiple institutions.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx) on distributed, heterogeneous MRI data. Development of an anatomically-informed loss prioritizing region-specific MRI texture contrasts. Data from seven institutions (711 T1W, 726 T2W scans) used for training and evaluation.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for handling pancreatic heterogeneity in FL setting. The anatomically-informed loss improved region-specific segmentation performance. The approach achieved clinically viable segmentation performance despite distributed data and privacy constraints.

Conclusion: First FL framework for pancreas part segmentation in MRI, demonstrating feasibility of privacy-preserving multi-institution collaboration for organ-part segmentation and introducing a loss that leverages anatomical priors to enhance MRI texture-based segmentation.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey of topology-aware perception in autonomous driving identifies four directions—vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language-model–based perception—and highlights a shift from static maps to dynamic, sensor-driven representations that enable compact spatial modeling, relational reasoning, knowledge integration, and multimodal understanding for scalable, explainable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static maps provide semantic context but are costly to build, hard to update in real time, and poorly generalize across regions. There is a need for dynamic, sensor-driven perception that can adapt in real time and scale to diverse environments.

Method: Systematic review of four research directions: (1) vectorized map construction, (2) topological structure modeling, (3) prior knowledge fusion, and (4) language model–based perception, analyzing how each contributes to dynamic, topology-aware understanding and identifying common trends and requirements.

Result: The survey reveals a unifying trend toward dynamic representations driven by onboard sensors, enabling real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Contributions across directions include compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding via pre-trained language models, collectively supporting more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sensor-driven perception is essential for scalable autonomous driving. The four directions collectively advance adaptive, explainable perception by moving away from static maps toward real-time, topologically aware representations that fuse knowledge and language-based understanding.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations to achieve end-to-end visual decoding from fMRI, introducing IBBI (Image-Brain Bi-directional interpretability) to reveal how different cortical areas influence the diffusion denoising trajectory, and showing competitive reconstruction quality with greater interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain-to-image decoding largely maps brain signals into intermediate image/text features, which obscures the contributions of individual brain regions to the final reconstruction. There is a need for end-to-end decoding and transparent interpretation of how brain activity shapes generative outputs.

Method: Introduce NeuroAdapter, a framework that directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations (bypassing intermediate feature spaces). Develop Image-Brain Bi-directional interpretability (IBBI) to analyze cross-attention across diffusion denoising steps and identify the influence of different cortical areas on the generative trajectory.

Result: Achieves competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior methods, while providing enhanced transparency about how brain signals drive the generation process.

Conclusion: End-to-end brain-to-image decoding is feasible with diffusion models, and diffusion-based generation can be interpreted through a neuroscience lens using the proposed IBBI framework, paving the way for more interpretable brain-to-image systems.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, edge-friendly framework for robust 6D pose estimation and tracking of novel objects under challenging lighting, using a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature for both registration and tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and real-time tracking under difficult illumination, especially on edge devices that have limited compute and power.

Method: Proposes a unified framework combining a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker, both built on a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature. The feature enables robust RGB-D to 3D-mesh registration for initialization and validates temporal correspondences for motion regression in tracking, making the approach lightweight for edge deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show competitive pose estimation accuracy and robust tracking performance, maintaining high-fidelity tracking through abrupt pose changes while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature provides a consistent foundation for both stages, enabling accurate, robust, and efficient 6D pose estimation and tracking of novel objects under challenging illumination on edge devices.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

*Kaicheng Yang,Xun Zhang,Haotong Qin,Yucheng Lin,Kaisen Yang,Xianglong Yan,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuQ introduces a quantization-aware training pipeline for diffusion transformers (DiTs) that uses ternary weights with per-layer activation precision to achieve sub-4-bit activations and competitive image generation on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers are powerful but computationally and memory-intensive; standard QAT successes on U-Nets do not translate easily to DiTs due to sensitive activations and complex per-token distributions; robust activation quantization is needed for practical deployment.

Method: Establish a strong W1.58A4 DiT baseline; propose RobustQuantizer to stabilize activation quantization via distribution normalization aided by a Hadamard transform; introduce Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network (AMPN) that uses ternary weights globally while allocating layer-wise activation precision to remove bottlenecks.

Result: RobuQ achieves state-of-the-art quantization performance for DiTs in sub-4-bit settings, enabling stable and competitive image generation on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K) with average activations around 2 bits.

Conclusion: RobuQ demonstrates that robust activation quantization and mixed-precision activation strategies can unlock efficient deployment of diffusion transformers, offering practical, scalable quantized DiTs with minimal loss in generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

*Hangtian Zhao,Xiang Chen,Yizhe Li,Qianhao Wang,Haibo Lu,Fei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastViDAR introduces a 360° depth estimation framework from four fisheye cameras using Alternative Hierarchical Attention (AHA) for cross-view feature fusion and ERP fusion to project multi-view depths into a common equirectangular frame, achieving up to 20 FPS on NVIDIA Orin NX and strong zero-shot results on HM3D/2D3D-S.

*Shulian Zhang,Yong Guo,Long Peng,Ziyang Wang,Ye Chen,Wenbo Li,Xiao Zhang,Yulun Zhang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace: a one-step diffusion-based video face enhancement framework that uses WANX priors, joint latent-pixel training, and MLLM-assisted data curation to deliver fast, high-quality, temporally stable face videos, achieving SOTA perceptual quality and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three core issues in video face enhancement: (1) faithful textured detail with temporal consistency, (2) limited high-quality face-video data for generalization, and (3) inefficiency from iterative denoising in diffusion-based methods.

Method: A one-step diffusion approach built on WANX via a single-step flow matching paradigm for direct degraded-to-clean mapping. A Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy with stochastic switching between facial-region optimization and global reconstruction in a progressive two-stage training process. An MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality video face datasets to improve generalization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time. Provides practical resources for the research community.

Conclusion: VividFace demonstrates that one-step diffusion, together with targeted latent-pixel supervision and automated data curation, can deliver fast, high-fidelity, temporally coherent video face enhancement with strong generalization potential.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

*Guole Shen,Tianchen Deng,Yanbo Wang,Yongtao Chen,Yilin Shen,Jiuming Liu,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end, memory-enhanced dense SLAM framework (GRS-SLAM3R) that processes RGB sequences to produce globally consistent, metric-scale dense maps in real time by memory-based spatial updates and submap registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based approaches rely on processing many image pairs and predicting per-pair maps in local frames, which neglect spatial memory and global consistency, especially for sequential data without prior scene/camera information.

Method: GRS-SLAM3R introduces a latent spatial memory with a transformer-based gated update module to progressively reset and update memory across frames. It processes sequential RGB input to incrementally estimate metric-scale point clouds in a global coordinate system. The scene is partitioned into submaps; local alignment is applied within each submap, and submaps are registered into a common world frame using relative constraints to produce a globally consistent map.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The approach achieves globally consistent, high-quality dense reconstructions without prior scene or camera knowledge by combining memory-augmented processing, submap local alignment, and global registration.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

### [114] [Multi-Level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer Network on Forward Scattering Center Model for Limited Samples SAR ATR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23596)
*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network transfers forward scattering center model (FSCM) knowledge from simulated to real SAR data to improve target recognition under limited samples, using TAIS for informative feature selection, MDD-based distribution alignment, and CRKT for category-relations consistency, achieving superior results on FSCM-measured datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR target recognition suffers from limited real data; simulated data introduce irrelevant background/noise; FSCM provides physically meaningful target representation; thus there is a need to transfer purer target knowledge from FSCM-informed simulations to measured data.

Method: Propose MHKT network that transfers FSCM knowledge at feature, distribution, and category levels. Use TAIS to select informative feature representations and filter non-informative knowledge. In distribution alignment, apply a new metric MDD (Maximum Discrimination Divergence) within the TGKT module to efficiently transfer transferable knowledge while preserving class discriminative structure. Use CRKT (category relation knowledge transfer) to enforce category relation consistency and mitigate optimization bias caused by simulated-measured data imbalance. The approach employs stepwise knowledge selection and migration to retain FSCM knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on two newly formed datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images show the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MHKT effectively migrates FSCM knowledge across feature, distribution, and category levels, addressing simulated-to-measured data gaps and yielding improved SAR target recognition with limited samples.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a closed-loop evaluation framework for end-to-end autonomous driving in CARLA that uses real-world-inspired digital twins and 800 traffic scenarios extracted from infrastructure-sensor video to enable more realistic, diverse, and challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA-based benchmarks rely on manually configured scenarios that may not reflect real-world driving conditions, limiting the evaluation's fidelity and transferability. A closer integration of real-world traffic and environments aims to yield more realistic performance assessments.

Method: Extract 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from a 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors; create 15 static digital twin assets of real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance; integrate these digital twins into CARLA with infrastructure cooperation to produce a realistic, diverse closed-loop environment for end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Result: Establishes a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark that captures diversity in driving behaviors, locations, weather, and times of day at complex urban intersections, enabling more realistic and challenging evaluation of end-to-end driving models.

Conclusion: The framework improves fidelity and reliability of autonomous driving evaluation by better mirroring real-world conditions; it provides a scalable, real-world-informed benchmark (DriveE2E) for end-to-end methods.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Liang Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAMamba presents a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with FIFO-based QCLAM memory and greedy GPS-SS2D scanning, enabling adaptive degradation handling and efficient feature reuse in image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization that limit restoration quality and computational efficiency in conventional Mamba-based restoration methods.

Method: QCLAM (Queue-based Cache Low-rank Adaptive Memory) uses a FIFO cache to store historical representations; similarity between current LoRA-adapted features and cached features guides adaptive fusion for dynamic memory reuse. GPS-SS2D (Greedy Path Scan SS2D) uses a Vision Transformer to estimate pixel importance via score maps and a greedy strategy to select forward/backward scanning paths, replacing rigid patterns with learned trajectories.

Result: VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in restoration quality and efficiency across diverse tasks, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration; code is available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Integrating adaptive memory (QCLAM) and adaptive scanning (GPS-SS2D) enables focused restoration on degraded regions while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive, learned pathways for image restoration.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMART-R1 introduces an R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm for next-token models to align agent behavior with human preferences, using a metric-oriented policy optimization and a recurring SFT-RFT-SFT loop, achieving state-of-the-art realism on WOMD/WOSAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work targets distribution shift between training and testing in data-driven traffic simulators, which harms generalization to unseen environments; aims to better align simulated agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics.

Method: Proposes an R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning framework (SMART-R1) with metric-oriented policy optimization, and an iterative SFT-RFT-SFT training strategy that alternates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to improve distribution alignment on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD).

Result: Demonstrates improved distribution alignment and performance; achieves state-of-the-art overall realism meta score (0.7858) on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) leaderboard at submission time.

Conclusion: A simple yet effective R1-style training framework can enhance foundation models for scalable and realistic multi-agent traffic simulation, with strong empirical validation on large-scale driving datasets.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the
leaderboard at the time of submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep latent-variable framework (deep taxonomic networks) learns complete binary hierarchical prototypes via a tree-structured mixture-of-Gaussians prior and variational inference to discover unlabeled taxonomies and improve hierarchical clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep hierarchical clustering methods tie the structure to the number of classes and underutilize prototype information at intermediate levels; there is a need for data-driven discovery of rich, interpretable taxonomies from unlabeled data.

Method: Introduce deep taxonomic networks that optimize a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussians prior as a latent hierarchy within a variational inference framework, maximizing the ELBO to discover hierarchical prototype relationships and clusters across all levels.

Result: Empirically outperform baselines on diverse image datasets for hierarchical clustering using a novel evaluation that leverages prototype clusters from all hierarchical levels; qualitative results show rich, interpretable hierarchical taxonomies capturing coarse-to-fine distinctions.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks effectively discover hierarchical taxonomies and prototype clusters from unlabeled data, addressing limitations of existing hierarchical clustering methods and enabling interpretable, flexible taxonomies.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

TL;DR: New annotated gaze-estimation dataset for HRI in a shared-workspace using the NICO robot. Four state-of-the-art models evaluated; angular errors align with general benchmarks, but median workspace-distance error is 16.48 cm, revealing practical limitations. Offers recommendations for integrating gaze as an HRI modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze estimation is a valuable cue in human-robot interaction, but real-world HRI in shared workspaces challenges accuracy and usefulness. There is a need for context-specific datasets and benchmarks to understand practicality and improve integration.

Method: Create and annotate a dataset on the NICO robotic platform; evaluate four state-of-the-art gaze estimation models on this dataset; analyze angular error and translate to physical distance error in the shared workspace.

Result: Angular errors are similar to general benchmarks; the best median distance error in the workspace is 16.48 cm, highlighting practical limitations for real-world HRI use.

Conclusion: Current gaze estimation methods face notable practical limitations in shared-workspace HRI. The paper discusses these limitations and provides recommendations for effectively integrating gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI
context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset
collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art
gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close
to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in
terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

*Tangtangfang Fang,Jingxi Hu,Xiangjian He,Jiaqi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent-diffusion-based multistage anti-noise network (MAN) for fast, high-quality LDCT denoising in latent space with a 60x speedup; competitive fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models deliver high denoising quality in LDCT but are computationally expensive; clinical adoption requires fast, efficient inference.

Method: Compress LDCT data using a perceptually optimized autoencoder; perform fast deterministic conditional denoising with an attention-based U-Net within a latent diffusion framework; multistage noise suppression (MAN).

Result: On LDCT and Projection datasets, achieves superior perceptual quality vs CNN/GAN-based methods; comparable to heavy diffusion models in fidelity; inference is >60x faster than pixel-space diffusion denoisers; PSNR/SSIM competitive.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion in a compact latent space offers a practical path toward clinically viable, high-quality LDCT denoising without prohibitive computational costs.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based image fusion method (VMDiff) that merges two inputs into one coherent object, using hybrid denoising/inversion/spherical interpolation and adaptive similarity-based parameter search to reduce coexistent artifacts and semantic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coexistent generation (objects merely juxtaposed) and bias generation (one object dominates) hinder multi-source image-to-image synthesis; there is a need for structure-aware fusion.

Method: Hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation; an adaptive adjustment module with a similarity-based score to automatically optimize parameters.

Result: On a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs, VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff provides a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework for coherent single-object fusion from two inputs, addressing coexistent and bias issues; shows promise for artistic creation and related visual media.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

*Liubing Hu,Chen Wu,Anrui Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT combines differentiable 3D LUTs with a light fusion mechanism and iterative flow-matching to achieve real-time, scene-adaptive color correction with improved detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between efficiency and representational capacity in image enhancement: fixed 3D LUTs are fast but rigid; this work aims to retain LUT efficiency while increasing flexibility and detail.

Method: An ensemble of differentiable 3D LUTs transform the color space; a lightweight, content-aware network predicts fusion weights for O(1) fusion across LUTs; a lightweight fusion network performs scene-adaptive fusion across multiple LUTs; an iterative flow-matching module restores local structure and mitigates artifacts; end-to-end optimization with a composite perceptual/structural loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of FlowLUT, validating improved efficiency and quality due to LUT fusion and flow-based refinement.

Conclusion: FlowLUT provides an end-to-end framework that combines the efficiency of LUTs with flexible, flow-based refinement to achieve real-time, scene-adaptive color correction with enhanced detail.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

*Seungwook Kim,Seunghyeon Lee,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two training-free inference-time techniques—action-scaled classifier-free guidance and action-scaled noise truncation—leverage explicit action trajectories to improve controllability and realism in diffusion-based robot video generation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build better world models and robotics foundation models by generating faithful, controllable robot videos; existing methods treat actions as passive conditioning signals, and retraining for better control is costly. Training-free inference-time methods offer rapid, flexible improvements.

Method: During inference, explicitly incorporate action vectors by (1) scaling classifier-free guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude to control motion intensity, and (2) adjusting the initial noise distribution through action-scaled noise truncation to align with motion dynamics. Both techniques require no training and directly use the action parameters to guide generation.

Result: On real robot manipulation datasets, the proposed techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Conclusion: Inference-time, training-free action-aware strategies can substantially enhance controllability and realism in diffusion-based robot video generation, aiding the development of robust world models and robotics foundation models without additional training.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly

### [124] [InteractMove: Text-Controlled Human-Object Interaction Generation in 3D Scenes with Movable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23612)
*Xinhao Cai,Minghang Zheng,Xin Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces the InteractMove dataset for movable human–object interaction in 3D scenes and a pipeline to identify interaction objects, predict hand–object contact regions, and ensure physically plausible, collision-free motions via local-scene modeling and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human–scene interaction datasets largely focus on static objects, with limited interaction categories. Collecting data with movable objects is challenging and costly, hindering text-controlled interactions in dynamic scenes. A dataset and method addressing movable objects, diverse sizes/types, and plausible trajectories is needed.

Method: 1) Build InteractMove by aligning existing human–object interaction data with scene contexts. 2) Use 3D visual grounding to identify the interaction object. 3) Propose hand–object joint affordance learning to predict contact regions for different hand joints and object parts to enable accurate grasping/manipulation across diverse objects. 4) Optimize interactions with local-scene modeling and collision-avoidance constraints to produce physically plausible motions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method generates physically plausible, text-compliant interactions and outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: The paper provides a dataset and a pipeline for movable-human–object interaction in 3D scenes, enabling richer, text-controlled manipulation across multiple movable objects and setting a foundation for future research in dynamic scene interaction.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

*Cheng Huang,Weizheng Xie,Fan Gao,Yutong Liu,Ruoling Wu,Zeyu Han,Jingxi Qiu,Xiangxiang Wang,Zhenglin Yang,Hao Wang,Yongbin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioVessel-Net is an unsupervised, radius-guided, biostatistics-consistent framework for retinal vessel segmentation, paired with RetinaMix dataset, achieving near-perfect accuracy without labels and outperforming supervised methods; code/dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retinal vessel segmentation relies on annotated data and supervised learning, which is costly and hard to obtain in OCTA; there is a need for label-free, interpretable, efficient methods for glaucoma and ocular disease monitoring.

Method: An unsupervised generative framework that models vascular structures via biostatistics, uses adversarial refinement, and incorporates a radius-guided segmentation strategy. It operates without labeled data and is evaluated on RetinaMix, a new 2D/3D OCTA dataset with diverse populations, emphasizing explainability over pixel-wise segmentation.

Result: BioVessel-Net achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy on RetinaMix and existing datasets, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods. It is label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable; code and data are released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis with potential applications in glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are
available: https://github.com/VikiXie/SatMar8.

*Peter Hönig,Stefan Thalhammer,Jean-Baptiste Weibel,Matthias Hirschmanner,Markus Vincze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation (SCOPE) uses continuous semantic priors from DINOv2 to generalize to unknown objects, achieving SOTA results and enabling unseen-object grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in open environments must estimate poses for unknown objects; discrete category labels prevent robust generalization across known and unknown categories.

Method: A diffusion-based model that injects continuous semantic priors from DINOv2 via cross-attention, combined with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across instances beyond known categories.

Result: Outperforms current state of the art in synthetic category-level pose estimation with a 31.9% relative improvement on the 5°5cm metric; two instance-level datasets show generalization to unseen categories with grasping success up to 100%.

Conclusion: Continuous semantic priors enable generalization beyond labeled categories; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

### [127] [DiffInk: Glyph- and Style-Aware Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text to Online Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23624)
*Wei Pan,Huiguo He,Hiuyi Cheng,Yilin Shi,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation, combining InkVAE with dual latent-space regularization (OCR-based glyph accuracy and style-classification) and InkDiT latent diffusion to generate coherent pen trajectories conditioned on text and style. It achieves better glyph accuracy, style fidelity, and efficiency than prior methods; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, holistic full-line handwriting generation by addressing inefficiencies and lack of structural modeling in character/word-level methods, and to disentangle content (glyphs) from writer style in a structured latent space.

Method: InkVAE: a sequential variational autoencoder with two regularization losses—OCR-based glyph accuracy and style-classification—to structure latent space and disentangle content and style. InkDiT: a latent diffusion Transformer that conditions on target text and reference styles to produce coherent pen trajectories for full lines.

Result: DiffInk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in glyph accuracy and style fidelity and offers significantly improved generation efficiency for full-line handwriting generation.

Conclusion: DiffInk provides a novel, efficient, and semantically structured approach for full-line handwriting generation, enabling better content-style disentanglement and coherent line-level synthesis; code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

### [128] [RIV: Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23625)
*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction in Mask Diffusion Vision-Language Models via introspection training and recursive inference, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDVLMs currently cannot self-correct generated tokens, leading to uncorrected errors (including logical mistakes). A self-correcting mechanism is needed for more reliable multimodal generation.

Method: Two components: (1) Introspection Training: train an Introspection Model to detect errors in generated sequences, including grammatical, spelling, and notably logical inconsistencies. (2) Recursive Inference: after an unmask step, use the introspection model to identify errors, remask them, and repeat the unmask/introspection/remask loop until outputs stabilize.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: Introducing self-correction via introspection and recursion enhances reliability and performance of MDVLMs, with potential implications for broader sequence generation tasks.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

*Luis F. W. Batista,Tom Bourbon,Cedric Pradalier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging improves segmentation of floating debris, boosting mean IoU and reducing contour errors vs RGB, but increases model size and risk of new false positives; a reproducible PoTATO benchmark is provided to guide researchers in using polarized cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water surfaces suffer from glare and changing illumination, degrading semantic segmentation. Polarimetric cues offer a single-sensor approach to mitigate glare, but there is a need for standardized benchmarks comparing fusion networks and baselines.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO, a public polarimetric dataset of plastic bottles in inland waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using traditional models; evaluate improvements in IoU and contour accuracy; provide reproducible benchmark and publicly available code.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, increasing mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs; the added polarization channels enlarge models, increasing computational load and risk of new false positives.

Conclusion: Polarimetric cameras are a promising approach for robust floating-object segmentation; the provided benchmark and code enable researchers to assess applicability and accelerate related research.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAMDA uses Vision Foundation Models as teachers in a self-training UDA framework for multi-task dense prediction (semantic segmentation and depth) to produce high-quality pseudo-labels in the target domain, distilling robust generalization into a lightweight student network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in multi-task dense prediction for robotics is a problem; existing UDA methods rely on adversarial learning and underperform compared to self-training. Leveraging powerful VFMs as teachers could provide robust pseudo-labels for better generalization.

Method: Integrate segmentation and depth foundation models as teachers within a self-training loop. Generate pseudo-labels for the target domain via these teachers, then train a single student network to distill their capabilities. Also present a lightweight variant.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic-to-real UDA multi-task learning benchmarks and a day-to-night adaptation task. A lightweight variant attains SOTA accuracy while being more than 10× smaller than foundation models, showing strong efficiency for resource-constrained robotics.

Conclusion: FAMDA bridges the gap between multi-task UDA and self-training by using VFMs as teachers to produce high-quality pseudo-labels, enabling efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for robotics applications.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

*Jiuhong Xiao,Roshan Nayak,Ning Zhang,Daniel Tortei,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermalGen is an adaptive flow-based RGB-to-Thermal image translation model with RGB conditioning and style disentanglement, trained on eight large RGB-T datasets (including three new satellite-aerial collections), achieving competitive or superior translation quality to GAN and diffusion methods and capable of handling large viewpoint and sensor variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the lack of synchronized RGB-thermal pairs for visual-thermal fusion and cross-modality tasks, by synthesizing thermal images from abundant RGB data to enable training and evaluation.

Method: An adaptive flow-based generator conditioned on RGB inputs with a style-disentangled mechanism. The authors curated eight RGB-T paired datasets and introduced three large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets (DJI-day, Bosonplus-day, Bosonplus-night). They evaluate against GAN-based and diffusion-based methods across multiple benchmarks.

Result: ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods across RGB-T benchmarks. It is reportedly the first RGB-T translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images with significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ThermalGen advances RGB-T image translation by combining adaptive flow-based generation, RGB conditioning, and style disentanglement, enabled by large-scale, diverse RGB-T datasets; this broadens the applicability of RGB-to-thermal translation for cross-modality tasks and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

*Ruibing Hou,Mingshuang Luo,Hongyu Pan,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionVerse is a unified LLM-based framework that converts motion into discrete tokens via residual quantization, uses delay-parallel encoding and a dual-tower architecture to enable efficient, multi-person motion understanding and generation with strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the capabilities of LLMs to comprehensively understand, generate, and edit human motion, addressing efficient motion representation, inter-stream dependencies, and modality interference between motion and language.

Method: Introduce a motion tokenizer with residual quantization to map continuous motion into multi-stream discrete tokens; apply Delay Parallel Modeling to temporally stagger residual token streams for inter-stream dependency capture with single-stream efficiency; implement a dual-tower architecture with modality-specific parameters to stabilize fusion of motion and language; validate via ablations and extensive experiments.

Result: Ablation studies confirm the usefulness of each component; MotionVerse achieves superior performance across diverse motion-related tasks while maintaining computational efficiency close to single-stream modeling; demonstrates effective inter-stream dependency capture and robust single/multi-person handling.

Conclusion: MotionVerse provides a unified, scalable approach for LLM-enabled motion understanding and generation in single- and multi-person scenarios, with modular components that deliver performance gains and stable multimodal integration.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair debiases text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning the text encoder with a collaborative distance-constrained strategy and a two-stage sampling method, delivering SOTA debiasing with 1/4 training burden and minimal sampling overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate bias originating from the text encoder that skews CLIP-space embeddings and is amplified by the noise predictor, without heavy retraining.

Method: Collaborative distance-constrained debiasing to adjust text embeddings; two-stage text-guided sampling to restrict intervention; evaluation on Stable Diffusion v1.5; no auxiliary references.

Result: Achieves SOTA debiasing at 1/4 training burden; virtually no increase in sampling burden; code released.

Conclusion: Efficiently improves fairness in T2I DMs by targeting the text encoder, balancing parameter efficiency and generation quality.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast, sparse spatiotemporal representation for event cameras (F^3) learned by predicting future events, enabling state-of-the-art optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation across varied platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce highly sparse, high-rate data that are difficult to process with traditional frames-based methods. There is a need for a robust, efficient representation that preserves scene structure and motion and is resilient to noise and varying event rates for real-time downstream tasks.

Method: Learn F^3 by predicting future events from past events to shape the representation. It uses multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets to construct a contiguous spatiotemporal volume represented as a multi-channel image, exploiting sparsity for efficiency. The approach runs at 25–75 Hz at HD, with capable rates (120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA) for construction, and is validated on tasks including optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation across diverse platforms and conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation across three robotic platforms (car, quadruped, flying platform) under varied lighting, environments, and sensor configurations; maintains robustness to motion and noise, and supports real-time inference.

Conclusion: F^3 provides a scalable, robust, and efficient representation for event data by coupling predictive learning with multi-resolution hashing and deep set techniques, enabling high-rate inference and broad applicability to multiple vision tasks across platforms.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

TL;DR: EfficientMIL introduces a linear-complexity MIL for WSIs with Adaptive Patch Selector, replacing self-attention with lightweight sequence models, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIL in computational pathology relies on attention with quadratic complexity, making large WSIs computationally expensive. A scalable approach is needed.

Method: Replace quadratic attention with linear-sequence models (GRU, LSTM, SSM Mamba) in a MIL framework, guided by an Adaptive Patch Selector to pick informative patches.

Result: Significant computational efficiency gains and superior performance on TCGA-Lung (EfficientMIL-Mamba: AUC 0.976, acc 0.933) and CAMELYON16 (EfficientMIL-GRU: AUC 0.990, acc 0.975) surpassing prior methods; APS enhances patch selection.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL demonstrates that linear-complexity MIL with effective patch selection can outperform existing attention-based MIL methods in WSIs classification and substantially reduce resource usage.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

TL;DR: Training-free multi-image layout control for text-to-image models using a single reference image to guide object and part placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only prompts can be insufficient for explicit content and precise placement; there is a need for content-and-layout control that doesn’t require retraining or many examples.

Method: A training-free approach that uses a single reference image to specify content and its placement, enabling explicit object- and part-level composition during generation.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness across a range of image composition tasks.

Conclusion: Offers a simple, training-free solution for multi-image layout control that enables fine-grained composition in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient framework for high-fidelity texture modeling using sparse voxels, surface-anchored upsampling, and view-domain patch partitioning to preserve high-frequency textures while maintaining multi-view consistency under reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D asset creation suffers from loss of high-frequency texture details. Existing methods trade spatial resolution or cross-view consistency, leading to torn textures or limited texture detail. There is a need to preserve fine textures at high resolution without prohibitive memory costs.

Method: 1) Surface anchoring with a learnable upsampling strategy constrains voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of redundant voxels compared to conventional voxel upsampling. 2) View-domain partitioning uses image patch-guided voxel partitioning, supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches, reducing unnecessary computation on occluded or unseen areas.

Result: The approach significantly reduces memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training while preserving geometric consistency and maintaining high-frequency texture details. The surface anchoring and patch-based supervision together enable efficient, detailed texture modeling without sacrificing cross-view coherence.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up demonstrates a practical path toward memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling by combining surface-constrained upsampling with patch-guided, view-aware training, enabling high-resolution textures on complex geometries with reduced resource demands.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

*Congzhi Zhang,Zhibin Wang,Yinchao Ma,Jiawei Peng,Yihan Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ReWatch, a large-scale video-reasoning dataset with three components (Caption, QA, CoT) and a Multi-Agent ReAct CoT synthesis framework to simulate re-watching. Builds ReWatch-R1 by SFT+RLVR with an Observation & Reasoning reward, achieving state-of-the-art on five video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video reasoning in LVLMs is impeded by data bottlenecks: lack of challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded CoT data to bootstrap RLVR. A high-quality dataset and training paradigm are needed to improve reasoning and reduce hallucinations.

Method: 1) Multi-stage synthesis to create ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, ReWatch-CoT. 2) Multi-Agent ReAct framework to generate video-grounded CoT traces by simulating a re-watching process with explicit information retrieval and verification. 3) After dataset, train a strong LVLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RLVR with an Observation & Reasoning (O&R) reward that evaluates final answer correctness and policy-aligned reasoning with video content to penalize hallucinations.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ReWatch dataset and the RLVR framework provide a scalable path to bolster video reasoning in LVLMs, addressing data scarcity and hallucination through explicit video-grounded CoT and reward shaping.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

### [140] [HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23663)
*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free, hierarchical visual token pruning method for vision-language models that uses middle-layer attention to estimate token importance, enabling global and local token retentions to substantially speed up inference without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models output many visual tokens, many of which are not essential for tasks, leading to slow inference. Prior pruning methods often require training or fine-tuning; a training-free, efficient pruning method is desirable.

Method: Compute token importance from middle-layer attention maps of the vision encoder. Reshape the 1-D token sequence into a 2-D spatial layout. Global stage: divide the image into regions and keep high-importance tokens per region. Local stage: divide into small windows and keep the most important token in each window. Prune tokens accordingly to produce a smaller token set for inference, without retraining.

Result: On LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B, HIVTP reduces time-to-first-token by up to 50.0% and 55.1% and increases token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, respectively, with no loss in accuracy and even occasional accuracy gains on certain benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP offers improved inference efficiency for VLMs in a training-free manner, outperforming prior pruning approaches while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

*Xixi Jiang,Chen Yang,Dong Zhang,Pingcheng Dong,Xin Yang,Kwang-Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STIM-TM, a training-free spatiotemporal token merging approach for surgical videos that decouples temporal and spatial token reduction, achieving over 65% GFLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy and enabling long-sequence training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers are effective but computationally expensive for video due to massive spatiotemporal tokens; existing token merging methods ignore video structure and heterogeneous information distribution, hindering performance in surgical video understanding.

Method: Introduce STIM-TM with decoupled temporal and spatial merging. Temporal: merge spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting to preserve sequential information. Spatial: merge static tokens based on temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic, information-rich regions. Training-free design to reduce computation.

Result: Achieves >65% GFLOPs reduction with preserved competitive accuracy across surgical video tasks; enables efficient training of long-sequence videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM is the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding, offering substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance and addressing computational bottlenecks in long-sequence surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks may rely on localized visual cues rather than genuine global reasoning, risking poor real-world performance and hindering robust dataset design.

Method: Define RCI as a comparison of reference-model performance on image patches versus full images; systematically apply it to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks to quantify global vs. local reliance and identify spatial biases.

Result: RCI reveals that most benchmarks favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases; the metric serves to diagnose and mitigate these biases.

Conclusion: RCI is an actionable tool for diagnosing and mitigating biases, enabling dataset and benchmark construction that promotes robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Dayu Tan,Ziwei Zhang,Yansan Su,Xin Peng,Yike Dai,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal brain image segmentation framework that combines a bidirectional spatial perception branch with a multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy to overcome the quadratic complexity of global attention in CNN-Transformer hybrids, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field struggles to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency: global attention in CNN-Transformer hybrids is computationally expensive; existing distillation or sparse attention methods often fail to reach high accuracy on complex, volumetric tasks such as brain segmentation.

Method: A 3D multi-modal segmentation framework, MSD-KMamba, featuring a bidirectional spatial aware branch that captures long-range spatial dependencies and a nonlinear feature extractor, plus a multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy to strengthen hierarchical representations and facilitate semantic transfer across resolutions. This design mitigates the quadratic cost of volumetric global attention while preserving global perception.

Result: Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks show MSD-KMamba consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization, with favorable computational efficiency and scalability. The authors also release the source code publicly (GitHub).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively overcomes the computational bottlenecks of global attention in 3D segmentation, maintains high performance, and offers strong generalization and scalability across modalities and datasets.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

TL;DR: QuantSparse unifies model quantization with attention sparsification for diffusion transformers, using multi-scale salient attention distillation and second-order sparse attention reparameterization to mitigate information loss and recover lost signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization and sparsification each degrade performance when aggressively compressed; together they can compound errors via quantization noise and attention shifts, hindering practical deployment of diffusion-video transformers.

Method: A unified framework comprising (1) Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation to provide global structure and local salient supervision, mitigating quantization-induced bias; (2) Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization that leverages stable second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Demonstrated on HunyuanVideo-13B and designed to work with compressed attention modules.

Result: QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while offering a 3.68× reduction in storage and a 1.88× acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: A unified quantization-plus-sparsification approach can realize strong practical gains for diffusion transformers, balancing quality and efficiency; the authors plan to release code.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HomeSafeBench introduces a large, dynamic, first-person-view benchmark for home safety hazards to evaluate embodied agents and vision-language models, revealing major gaps with best F1 around 10.23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks rely on textual environmental descriptions and fixed viewpoints, which inadequately evaluate embodied agents' capabilities in real-world, vision-based safety tasks. A visual, interactive benchmark with exploration is needed to properly assess VLM-driven home safety inspection.

Method: 12,900 data points across five hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety) in simulated home environments. It provides dynamic first-person perspective images and allows free exploration, yielding multiple viewpoints for thorough inspection. The study evaluates mainstream VLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, indicating substantial limitations in current VLMs for hazard identification and effective exploration strategies in home safety inspection tasks.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench offers a valuable reference for advancing research in home safety inspection with embodied agents. The dataset and code are expected to be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensembling diverse SSD detectors with different backbones (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3) and fusing their outputs with Weighted Boxes Fusion (max-confidence) improves weapon detection in surveillance, achieving mAP 0.838—a notable gain over best single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public-space surveillance requires robust weapon detection under occlusion, varied lighting, and clutter; single-model detectors struggle in challenging conditions, so diversity and effective fusion may improve reliability.

Method: Train multiple SSD detectors using diverse backbones (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3). Combine predictions with Weighted Boxes Fusion using a max-confidence scoring strategy to produce final detections.

Result: Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838 achieved, representing a 2.948% relative improvement over the best single model; WBF with max-confidence outperforms other fusion heuristics.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism enabling ensembles to outperform individual detectors in surveillance weapon detection, supporting robust real-time applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instinctively efficient instance-level interaction for LiDAR-based collaborative perception. It uses quality-aware filtering, dual-branch routing to separate collaboration-relevant/irrelevant instances, and cross-agent local instance fusion, plus enhanced GT sampling. Delivers strong accuracy gains with large bandwidth reductions and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception across multiple vehicles can overcome single-vehicle limitations (range, occlusion) but demands high bandwidth and real-time processing. While query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth and relies on priors, LiDAR-focused collaborative methods lag behind state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Three core components: (1) quality-aware filtering to select high-quality instance features; (2) dual-branch detection routing to decouple collaboration-irrelevant vs collaboration-relevant instances; (3) Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, enhanced ground-truth sampling to train with diverse hybrid instance features.

Result: Empirical results show improved accuracy: 13.23% on DAIR-V2X and 33.08% on V2V4Real; reduced communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 of baselines. Code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: INSTINCT advances LiDAR-based collaborative perception by efficient, instance-level interaction. It achieves notable accuracy gains while substantially reducing bandwidth, addressing both performance and communication constraints. The work provides practical components and training strategies for robust cross-agent perception and is available as open-source.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Boseong Jeon,Junghyuk Lee,Jimin Park,Kwanyoung Kim,Jingi Jung,Sangwon Lee,Hyunbo Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion-based editing model that jointly learns removal and insertion prompts with classifier-free guidance to enhance removal of objects and their effects, control effect insertion, and move objects in one denoising step, without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding how classifier-free guidance for object effects can be applied within a unified removal/insertion model, and existing methods often require separate stages or additional training to handle shadows, reflections, and other effects in composite edits, limiting efficiency.

Method: CrimEdit jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single diffusion model and uses classifier-free guidance with these embeddings. It extends prompts to spatially distinct regions to enable object movement (repositioning) in one denoising step, and does not require separate removal/insertion stages or extra training.

Result: Extensive experiments show CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement, outperforming baselines and avoiding the need for additional training or staged approaches.

Conclusion: A unified, efficient framework for editing that combines object removal, effect insertion, and movement within a single model, leveraging guidance techniques to enhance performance across tasks.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

*Shuai Shao,Shu Jiang,Shiyuan Zhao,Di Yang,Yan Wang,Yutong Bai,Jianguo Zhang,Jiangtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end MRI-based PD diagnostic framework PD-Diag-Net using MRI preprocessing, brain-region priors, and age-informed modules; achieves 86% external accuracy and >96% early-stage accuracy, surpassing baselines by >20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PD diagnosis is hampered by complex workflows and reliance on neurologists; there is a need for automated, robust, and interpretable tools that can handle inter-subject and inter-scanner variability and leverage domain priors to improve early detection.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline with an MRI-Processor for preprocessing, two priors (Relevance-Prior for PD-associated regions and Aging-Prior for accelerated aging in PD), an Aggregator module guiding feature aggregation toward PD regions, and a Diagnoser module using brain-age gaps as intra-subject constraints. External test data were collected from a collaborating hospital.

Result: External test accuracy: 86%; early-stage accuracy: >96%; outperforms existing advanced methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net demonstrates strong diagnostic performance with improved early detection and interpretability through brain-region priors, validated on external data, suggesting potential for clinical deployment with flexible preprocessing and priors.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

### [150] [DiffPCN: Latent Diffusion Model Based on Multi-view Depth Images for Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23723)
*Zijun Li,Hongyu Yan,Shijie Li,Kunming Luo,Li Lu,Xulei Yang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN introduces a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. It converts partial point clouds into depth images, uses a depth-LDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth maps to form coarse point clouds, then denoises outliers and upsamples using association-aware features to produce dense, high-fidelity outputs. It achieves state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and shape completeness while improving robustness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud completion is challenging due to the unstructured, irregular nature of point clouds. Leveraging latent diffusion models (LDMs) could provide powerful generative and comprehension capabilities, but their use for 3D point clouds is underexplored. A coarse-to-fine approach that preserves fidelity and reduces artifacts is needed.

Method: 1) Project unordered partial point clouds into structured depth images to condition a DepthLDM that synthesizes completed multi-view depth images. 2) Fuse these into coarse point clouds to achieve high completeness. 3) Apply a Point Denoising Network to remove depth-map artifacts by predicting per-point distance scores. 4) Use an Association-Aware Point Upsampler that leverages local association features between input and coarse points to produce dense, high-quality outputs.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and shape completeness in point cloud completion, with improved robustness and consistency due to the denoising and association-aware upsampling stages.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively harnesses diffusion-based generation for point cloud completion via a well-designed coarse-to-fine pipeline, mitigating outliers and enhancing upsampling to produce high-fidelity, complete point clouds.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

*Lars Doorenbos,Federico Spurio,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free visual prompting for long-video understanding that merges multiple frames into panel images to boost QA accuracy, achieving up to 19.4% gains on TimeScope Long and consistent gains across five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context modeling in video-language models (VLMs) lags behind image/short-video tasks. Without extra training data or fine-tuning, there is a need for efficient techniques to enhance long-video understanding.

Method: Introduce a visual prompting strategy that combines multiple frames into a single panel image, trading spatial detail for temporal resolution. The approach is training-free, parameter-free, model-agnostic, and can be plugged into existing VLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show consistent improvements across model architectures, sizes, and context windows. On the TimeScope (Long) dataset, video QA accuracy improves by up to 19.4%.

Conclusion: A training-free, model-agnostic prompting method significantly boosts long-video understanding and sets a stronger baseline; the authors plan to release code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

*Yiheng Zhang,Zhuojiang Cai,Mingdao Wang,Meitong Guo,Tianxiao Li,Li Lin,Yuwang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale, multi-source dataset for text-driven 3D indoor layout generation, enabling richer spatial and semantic learning for layout synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout datasets are limited in scale, diversity, and annotation quality, hindering learning of robust layout generation models.

Method: Assemble M3DLayout from real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes (15,080 layouts, 258k object instances). Each layout comes with structured text describing global scene, relations among large furniture, and fine-grained small-item arrangements. Establish a benchmark with a text-conditioned diffusion model; Inf3DLayout subset adds rich small-object information.

Result: Dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models; multi-source composition increases diversity and supports more complex scenes; initial diffusion-model benchmark demonstrates feasibility and benefits.

Conclusion: M3DLayout is a valuable resource for advancing text-driven 3D scene synthesis, enabling better learning of spatial and semantic patterns across diverse indoor environments.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

### [153] [LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729)
*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LUQ, Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, for multimodal LLMs and shows selective ultra-low-bit quantization across layers plus multimodal token mix improves PTQ; achieves substantial memory savings with small accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are memory and compute heavy. PTQ is effective for text LMs but not well explored for multimodal LLMs. The paper investigates ultra-low-bit quantization (<4-bit) and layerwise variability in activation distributions to enable efficient deployment.

Method: Analyze per-layer activation variance and entropy for multimodal tokens. Identify layers more tolerant to ultra-low-bit quantization. Propose LUQ to apply ultra-low-bit quantization selectively. Show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) during PTQ boosts VQA performance in ultra-low-bit regime. Validate on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Result: LUQ reduces memory by 40% (LLaVA-1.5) and 31% (Qwen-2.5-VL) compared to 4-bit baselines, with less than 10% degradation on the MME benchmark.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective ultra-low-bit quantization is effective for multimodal LLMs. Activation distributions vary across layers; leveraging resilient layers yields large memory savings with modest performance loss. Incorporating multimodal token mixing further boosts PTQ performance in ultra-low-bit settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

### [154] [HieraTok: Multi-Scale Visual Tokenizer Improves Image Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23736)
*Cong Chen,Ziyuan Huang,Cheng Zou,Muzhi Zhu,Kaixiang Ji,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces HieraTok, a multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer with multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to enable progressive information flow, achieving notable improvements in image reconstruction and generation and beating single-scale tokenizers among ViT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-scale ViT tokenizers limit modeling capability for both global semantics and local structure; need multi-scale representations and a mechanism to progressively refine details.

Method: Propose HieraTok with (1) multi-scale downsampling of the tokenizer's encoder token map to produce tokens at multiple scales; (2) scale-causal attention to pass information from low-resolution global features to high-resolution details; train at scale and integrate with downstream generation frameworks; report rFID and gFID metrics.

Result: 27.2% reduction in rFID (1.47→1.07) under identical settings; 1.38x faster convergence and 18.9% improvement in gFID (16.4→13.3) when integrated; sota rFID 0.45 and gFID 1.82 among ViT tokenizers at larger training; claims first multi-scale ViT tokenizer for image reconstruction/generation.

Conclusion: Multi-scale ViT-based tokenizers can significantly improve both quality and efficiency of image reconstruction and generation, advancing ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation; potential for broader adoption and further refinements.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

### [155] [ResAD++: Towards Class Agnostic Anomaly Detection via Residual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23741)
*Xincheng Yao,Chao Shi,Muming Zhao,Guangtao Zhai,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose ResAD/ResAD++ for class-agnostic anomaly detection by learning residual feature distributions, applying a hypersphere constraint and novel losses, achieving state-of-the-art results on eight datasets for unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods learn class-related representations, which do not generalize well to unseen classes or domains. There is a need for a single model that can detect anomalies across diverse new classes without retraining.

Method: Compute residual features by matching and subtracting normal reference features to decorrelate representations; introduce a spatial hypersphere constraint to align feature scales across classes; propose a logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss; incorporate a vector-quantization-based feature distribution matching module; develop ResAD and its enhanced version ResAD++.

Result: ResAD++ achieves remarkable performance on eight real-world AD datasets for new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods as well as the original ResAD.

Conclusion: Residual-feature learning with decorrelation, scale normalization via a hypersphere, and novel loss/distribution-matching components yield strong, generalizable class-agnostic anomaly detection; ResAD++ advances the state-of-the-art and demonstrates effective cross-class generalization.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at
https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD.

*Wenjie Yang,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-refining, RL-trained visual pointing model Poivre-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on Point-Bench by iteratively predicting and refining coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle at pointing tasks when required to predict coordinates in a single step, falling short of human performance. An iterative refinement capability inspired by reasoning in NLP could bridge this gap and improve accuracy.

Method: Introduce Poivre: Point, Visualize, then Refine. The model first marks an estimated point on the image, then iteratively refines coordinates as needed. Training uses reinforcement learning with a purpose-built process reward designed to encourage effective refinement and alignment with targets. Poivre-7B is released to support further research (training/inference code, dataset, and checkpoint).

Result: Poivre-7B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: Self-refinement via a reinforcement-learning guided loop substantially improves visual pointing accuracy in VLMs, demonstrating the value of iterative reasoning for multi-step perception tasks and providing resources to advance future research.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel PVTAdpNet model combines a Pyramid Vision Transformer with a U‑Net style encoder–decoder, residual adapter blocks, and SE attention for real‑time polyp segmentation, achieving high Dice and IoU on both benchmark and out‑of‑distribution polyp datasets, with publicly available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome missed polyps and variability during traditional colonoscopy by enabling accurate, real‑time segmentation that can adapt to polyp variability, improving detection and treatment outcomes.

Method: Proposes PVTAdpNet: a U‑Net–style encoder–decoder architecture using a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter‑based skip connections, enhanced with squeeze‑and‑excitation attention. Evaluated on benchmark polyp datasets and out‑of‑distribution polyp data (e.g., PolypGen) with real‑time performance.

Conclusion: PVTAdpNet offers superior feature extraction, dense prediction, and gradient flow through its architecture, supporting potential clinical deployment for real‑time colorectal polyp segmentation with strong generalization to unseen data.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified diffusion-transformer framework, UniAlignment, uses dual-stream training for intrinsic- and cross-modal semantic alignment to enable robust multimodal generation, paired with SemGen-Bench for evaluating complex semantic consistency; it reportedly outperforms baselines on several tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on external vision-language models and fragmented architectures in multimodal diffusion systems, by enabling a single, coherent model that understands and follows complex multi-modal instructions.

Method: A single diffusion transformer with dual-stream training: intrinsic-modal semantic alignment (within modalities) and cross-modal semantic alignment (between text and image), enabling unified multimodal generation without modular wrappers; introduces SemGen-Bench to benchmark semantic consistency under complex instructions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show UniAlignment surpasses existing baselines across multiple tasks and benchmarks, highlighting improved cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.

Conclusion: UniAlignment demonstrates the viability of unified diffusion-based multimodal generation and reduction of architectural fragmentation, with SemGen-Bench providing a targeted evaluation of semantic alignment under complex instructions.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

### [159] [GenView++: Unifying Adaptive View Generation and Quality-Driven Supervision for Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23770)
*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ introduces adaptive multi-source view generation and a quality-driven contrastive objective to improve positive-pair construction and weighting in contrastive learning, achieving clear gains in both vision and vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning struggles with limited diversity and semantic corruption from augmentations, and lacks a mechanism to assess and weight the quality of positive pairs, leading to suboptimal supervision.

Method: A two-fold approach: (1) multi-source adaptive view generation that dynamically modulates generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies to create diverse yet semantically coherent views; (2) a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism that scores each pair on semantic alignment and diversity and reweights their training contribution to emphasize high-quality pairs.

Result: On ImageNet linear evaluation, MoCo v2 improves by 2.5 percentage points. In vision-language tasks, average zero-shot accuracy increases by 12.31% over CLIP and 5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, with Flickr30k R@5 improving by 3.2%. Code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively tackles both construction and learning limitations of contrastive learning, delivering consistent gains across vision and vision-language tasks and offering a practical, unified framework for high-quality positive-pair generation and weighting.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and

### [160] [A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772)
*Yaya Zhao,Kaiqi Zhao,Zixuan Tang,Zhiyuan Liu,Xiaoling Lu,Yalei Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR proposes a modality-tailored multimodal graph framework for urban region representation, addressing modality-specific structures and spatial heterogeneity through dedicated expert GNNs and spatially-aware fusion, with a joint contrastive learning objective; it outperforms baselines on real-world data across six modalities and three tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal urban graph models use identical GNN architectures across all modalities and assume region-invariant fusion weights, failing to capture modality-specific structures and spatial heterogeneity. This limits representation quality for downstream tasks.

Method: MTGRR splits modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups. Aggregated-level modalities are processed by a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture with dedicated expert GNNs per modality. The point-level modality uses a dual-level GNN to extract fine-grained visual semantics. A spatially-aware fusion mechanism dynamically infers region-specific modality fusion weights. A joint contrastive learning objective combines region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level signals to optimize representations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets with six modalities and three tasks shows MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of modality-tailored architectures and spatially-aware fusion.

Conclusion: MTGRR effectively captures modality-specific structures and spatial heterogeneity in urban multimodal data, yielding improved region representations for downstream tasks and demonstrating strong empirical gains across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

### [161] [Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction for Generative Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23774)
*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture Vector-Quantization with Reconstruction Aware Prediction (TVQ&RAP) for SR; reduces quantization error and aligns training with reconstruction quality, yielding photo-realistic SR at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQ-based SR methods encode features using nearest codewords and train the index predictor with code-level supervision, which induces large quantization errors and misaligns with the final reconstruction errors, limiting prior modeling accuracy.

Method: Propose a texture vector-quantization strategy that uses the SR task to model priors of missing textures, and a reconstruction-aware prediction strategy that uses a straight-through estimator to train the index predictor with image-level supervision.

Result: The model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with low computational cost.

Conclusion: TVQ&RAP effectively mitigates quantization errors and supervision mismatch in VQ-based SR, enabling efficient generation of high-quality, realistic SR outputs.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

### [162] [GroupCoOp: Group-robust Fine-tuning via Group Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23781)
*Nayeong Kim,Seong Joon Oh,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupCoOp introduces group-specific text prompts to debias fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), achieving strong group robustness with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned VLMs suffer from spurious correlations due to subgroup imbalance in training data; minority groups are neglected, and class distributions are scattered in embedding space.

Method: Use group-specific text prompts as group representatives acting as multiple classifiers per class; leverage the text encoder to discover effective prompts even with few samples; train only a tiny fraction of parameters (0.016%).

Result: Achieves best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures; sometimes surpasses full fine-tuning methods while updating only 0.016% of parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp provides a simple, effective, parameter-efficient debiasing approach that enhances group robustness in VLM fine-tuning without substantial computational cost.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

*Mahdi Farrokhimaleki,Parsa Rahmati,Richard Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-based pipeline to identify and repair unstable 2D game levels produced by PCG, tested on Angry Birds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCG can generate diverse levels, but quality control is challenging; unstable or gap-prone levels reduce playability. An automatic repair workflow can improve reliability and standards.

Method: Use object segmentation on level images to detect structural gaps; perform targeted repairs. Evaluate multiple segmentation models and select the best as the basis for a repair pipeline; apply repairs to fix instability.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed image-based repair method improves the stability and playability of AI-generated Angry Birds levels; the approach is designed to generalize to other 2D games with similar level structures.

Conclusion: An image-based QA/repair workflow for PCG can enhance quality of procedurally generated 2D game levels and is adaptable to a broad set of games beyond Angry Birds.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

*Mengyuan Niu,Xinxin Zhuo,Ruizhe Wang,Yuyue Huang,Junyan Yang,Qiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A controllable framework for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation that fuses geometry and semantics, extending 2D layouts to 3D by using edge weights and building-height embedding, enabling user control via semantic attributes; demonstrates validity of large urban models for planning and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either rely on image-based generation that lacks geometric continuity and scalability, or graph-based methods that capture relations but miss parcel semantics. There is a need for a unified, controllable approach to generate realistic 3D urban layouts at city scale that integrate geometry and semantics.

Method: Proposes a framework that fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, and embeds building height within a graph to extend 2D layouts into realistic 3D structures. The model is conditioned on both geometry and semantics and allows users to directly control outputs by modifying semantic attributes.

Result: Experiments show the method produces valid, large-scale urban models, indicating it is an effective data-driven tool for planning and design across city-scale contexts.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, controllable path from 2D layouts to realistic 3D urban structures by integrating geometry, semantics, and edge-aware graph representations, supporting data-driven planning, design, and gaming applications.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven
planning and design.

*Ali Nazeri,Shashank Mishra,Achim Wagner,Martin Ruskowski,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view quality control system using three cameras, image fusion, and a new annotated dataset to outperform single-view inspection in assembling small parts (e.g., screws).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome occlusions, limited viewpoints, and lighting inconsistencies that hamper single-view inspection, reducing downtime and costs on production lines.

Method: Three-camera imaging system with a tailored image-fusion approach to combine detection results from all views. A new annotated dataset covering varied lighting, occlusions, and angles is developed to train and evaluate the system. Performance is benchmarked against single-view methods for identifying improperly fastened small parts.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms single-view QC, achieving high precision and recall in detecting improperly fastened small components. The dataset is publicly available to support broader research.

Conclusion: The work advances industrial automation by providing a scalable, cost-effective QC solution that improves reliability and safety on assembly lines and offers a publicly accessible dataset for replication and further study.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Efthymios Tsaprazlis,Tiantian Feng,Anil Ramakrishna,Rahul Gupta,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy and benchmarks state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models to assess their privacy understanding, revealing inconsistencies and underscoring the need for privacy-aware AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems, especially LLMs and VLMs, increasingly integrate language and vision, gaps in privacy understanding emerge; existing datasets and benchmarks are insufficient to systematically test and enforce privacy principles; legal frameworks can inform capabilities.

Method: Develop a comprehensive, scalable Visual Privacy Taxonomy aligned with legal notions of privacy; evaluate several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models on privacy-related tasks to assess their contextual privacy understanding; analyze performance and inconsistencies.

Result: The taxonomy provides a foundational framework for future research; experiments reveal notable inconsistencies and limitations in current VLMs' privacy understanding; the work provides a critical benchmark highlighting urgent need for privacy-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: Offers foundational taxonomy and benchmark; calls for integrating privacy principles into model design and evaluation to build more robust, privacy-conscious AI.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

### [167] [Uni4D-LLM: A Unified SpatioTemporal-Aware VLM for 4D Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23828)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM: a unified 4D vision–language model that jointly handles 4D scene understanding and generation within a single Transformer-based framework, using shared representations and adaptive cross-attention to fuse semantics, appearance, and geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D VLMs excel at image-language tasks but there is no unified model for 4D (spatiotemporal) scenes. Existing 3D/4D methods typically separate understanding (autoregressive) and generation (diffusion), hindering joint tasks in dynamic environments; a shared representation and architecture are needed for joint perception and generation.

Method: Introduce Uni4D-LLM with (1) a shared spatiotemporal visual representation built from semantic features for understanding and noisy appearance features for generation, plus 4D geometric cues; (2) adaptive cross-attention to fuse these cues; (3) a single Transformer backbone supporting both autoregression and diffusion, enabling their integration under a unified LLM with task-specific heads; (4) alignment of visual and linguistic representations; (5) instruction fine-tuning on diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior performance against state-of-the-art models and, importantly, provides the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of a single Transformer-based model that jointly handles 4D perception and content generation through shared representations, a unified architecture, and instruction-tuned generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeC uses a Large Vision-Language Model to inject semantic understanding into semi-supervised video object segmentation, improving zero-shot robustness; on MOSEv2 it achieved 39.7 and 2nd place in Complex VOS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on appearance-based pattern matching and improve robustness against drastic visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts by leveraging high-level semantic understanding of the target.

Method: Apply the Segment Concept (SeC) framework with a Large Vision-Language Model to obtain semantic representations of the target and perform zero-shot video object segmentation without fine-tuning; evaluate on the MOSEv2 dataset.

Result: Achieved 39.7 on the MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that incorporating LVLM-based semantic understanding can boost zero-shot VOS robustness and persistence, suggesting potential for further improvements through enhanced semantic representations or integration with other cues.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces T23D-CompBench, a large-scale, compositional benchmark for text-to-3D quality assessment, and Rank2Score, a two-stage learning-based evaluator that aligns with human judgments and serves as a reward for generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T23D QA benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and coarse-grained, hindering fine-grained metric training and robust evaluation; there is a need for a scalable, compositional benchmark and a metric that better captures human perception.

Method: Define five components with twelve sub-components for compositional prompts; synthesize 3,600 textured meshes using ten state-of-the-art T23D models; conduct a large-scale subjective study with 129,600 ratings; introduce Rank2Score with two-stage training: (1) supervised contrastive regression with curriculum learning to improve pairwise signals, (2) refinement using mean opinion scores to better match human judgments; Rank2Score can also function as a reward signal for model optimization.

Result: Rank2Score outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions in correlating with human judgments; the benchmark enables fine-grained evaluation and can support downstream tasks, including reward-based optimization; a project page is provided for access to data and code.

Conclusion: The work delivers a comprehensive compositional benchmark for T23D generation and a robust, human-aligned QA metric, enabling more reliable evaluation and optimization of T23D models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

*Michihiro Kuroki,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CE-FAM: a concept-based explanation method using a branched network that shares activation maps with a classifier and mimics Vision-Language Model embeddings to identify concept regions and their contributions, enabling zero-shot concept explanations without annotated data, with a new evaluation metric and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Saliency maps are often semantically vague, and existing concept-based explanations struggle to simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their spatial regions, and their contributions to predictions. A unified framework that can identify concepts, localize their regions, and quantify their impact—leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without labeled data—is needed.

Method: A branched network shares activation maps with the image classifier and learns to mimic embeddings of a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The branch predicts concepts in an image; the corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by gradients of the concept scores. Contributions are quantified by their impact on the image classification score. The framework uses VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without annotated datasets and introduces a novel evaluation metric for concept-region accuracy.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show CE-FAM outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, demonstrating effective identification of concept regions and meaningful contribution attribution.

Conclusion: CE-FAM provides a general, dataset-free framework for identifying concept regions and their contributions, leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts and improve interpretability of image classifications.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN+ViT with adversarial debiasing; achieves state-of-the-art facial beauty prediction accuracy while substantially reducing ethnic bias and improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs (local texture) and ViTs (global context) in facial beauty prediction, and mitigate protected-attribute biases to promote fairer, more transparent models in subjective vision tasks.

Method: A dual-branch architecture combining a CNN for local features and a Vision Transformer for global context, coupled with an adversarial debiasing mechanism that enforces protected-attribute invariance in the learned representations; transparency enhanced via visualization of branch focus; evaluated on SCUT-FBP5500.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art metrics: Pearson correlation 0.9230 and RMSE 0.2650; reduces the ethnic subgroup performance gap by 82.9%; adversary classifier accuracy drops to 52.1% (near random).

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN demonstrates a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer approach for subjective AI tasks in facial beauty prediction, offering a blueprint for responsible AI in biased domains.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple enhanced DETR baseline (Sim-DETR) for temporal sentence grounding addresses query conflicts with two decoder tweaks, yielding strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR-based approaches under temporal sentence grounding exhibit degraded performance due to (a) conflicts among similar target moment queries, and (b) tension between global semantics and local localization; understanding and mitigating these conflicts is key.

Method: Propose Sim-DETR by adding two decoder-layer modifications: (1) constrain self-attention between queries according to semantic/positional overlap, and (2) introduce query-to-frame alignment to connect global and local cues.

Result: Experiments show Sim-DETR unlocks full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding and provides a strong, simple baseline for future work.

Conclusion: Careful handling of query interactions and alignment between query and frame contexts is crucial when adapting DETR to temporal grounding; the proposed minimal changes yield substantial gains and a solid baseline.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

*Ky Dan Nguyen,Hoang Lam Tran,Anh-Dung Dinh,Daochang Liu,Weidong Cai,Xiuying Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGG stabilizes AR image generation by grounding guidance in important regions through attention, reducing drift across scales and yielding sharper, more semantically faithful images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive next-scale generation suffers from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which causes guidance drift and unfaithful features.

Method: Introduce Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) that uses attention to identify semantically important regions and adaptively reinforce informative patches during sampling to keep guidance aligned with conditioning.

Result: Across class-conditioned and text-to-image tasks, IGG produces sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images, outperforming prior AR methods and setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: IGG provides a robust mechanism to reduce drift, improve alignment between guidance and content, and enhance AR-based image generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

*Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal,Srikant Panda,Hansa Meghwani,Karan Dua,Paul Li,Tao Sheng,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PCRI, a robustness metric for MLLMs' sensitivity to visual context; shows models often brittle to background noise; identifies a few robust models; provides diagnostic value for model selection and future design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap in evaluation: existing metrics overlook sensitivity to visual context granularity and background noise; a systematic, interpretable index is needed to quantify robustness across tasks.

Method: Define Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI) as the performance difference when using localized image patches versus full-image inputs. Empirically evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs on 15 vision-language benchmarks to analyze how architectures handle visual context and context integration.

Result: Most leading models remain brittle to background noise; only a few models (e.g., InternVL2-26B, Qwen2VL-72B) show consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI provides actionable diagnostic insights for model selection and architecture/training choices.

Conclusion: PCRI enables principled, cross-model comparisons of context robustness and can guide future architecture design and training strategies for robust real-world deployment.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

### [175] [Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880)
*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learnable, context-aware pseudo-labeling module improves SS3DOD by adaptive thresholding and score fusion, boosting precision, coverage, and recall on KITTI/Waymo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on manually set thresholds and context-agnostic pseudo-label selection in SS3DOD, which can misjudge pseudo-label quality and hurt student learning.

Method: Introduce two teacher-output networks that fuse scores to assess pseudo-label quality and produce context-adaptive thresholds; supervise by alignment of pseudo-labels with GT. Add soft supervision to be robust to noisy pseudo-labels, guiding the student to favor cleaner labels.

Result: Demonstrates effective selection of high-precision pseudo-labels with broader context coverage and higher recall on KITTI and Waymo, improving state-of-the-art SS3DOD methods.

Conclusion: A context-aware, learnable pseudo-labeling framework with soft supervision enhances SS3DOD by better pseudo-label quality assessment and adaptive thresholds, yielding superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [176] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SuperDiff, a tunable-generalization diffusion framework for LDCT denoising using self-supervised contextual sub-data, achieving cross-dose generalization without requiring paired data and outperforming state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDCT denoising methods rely on paired data or clean-data distributions and struggle to generalize across dose levels; self-supervised approaches also suffer generalization gaps. There is a need for a method that enables tunable generalization using only projection-domain data.

Method: Contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing in the LDCT projection domain to provide an initial prior; combine knowledge distillation with latent diffusion models guided by the prior; use a pre-trained model for inference; pixel-level self-correcting fusion in the image domain leveraging the initial prior and LDCT image; dual-domain cascade self-supervised training using only LDCT projection-domain data, adaptable to unseen doses.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets and real data show SuperDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in reconstruction quality and generalization across dose levels.

Conclusion: SuperDiff enables effective LDCT denoising with tunable generalization under a self-supervised diffusion framework, reducing dependence on paired data and enabling cross-dose performance.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

### [177] [AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23888)
*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AssemblyHands-X, a markerless 3D hand–body benchmark for bimanual activity recognition, with a 3D pose annotation pipeline; shows that pose-based representations and joint hand–body modeling outperform video-only baselines and hand- or body-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of datasets with kinematic-level annotations for both hands and body; existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate only hands or only the body; marker-based motion capture introduces visual artifacts that hinder generalization to markerless videos; thus, it is necessary to study how hand–body coordination affects action understanding and to enable systematic evaluation.

Method: Develop AssemblyHands-X and a pipeline that combines synchronized multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting to annotate 3D poses of hands and upper body; evaluate multiple input representations (video, hand pose, body pose, hand–body pose) on action recognition models based on graph convolution and spatio-temporal attention.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines; joint modeling of hand and body cues improves recognition compared to using only hands or only the upper body, highlighting the importance of interdependent hand–body dynamics for holistic understanding of bimanual activities.

Conclusion: Modeling hand–body coordination is important for robust bimanual activity understanding, and AssemblyHands-X provides a markerless 3D hand–body benchmark and annotation pipeline to enable systematic evaluation of such approaches.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

### [179] [Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895)
*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) unlearns visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge using inverse contrastive learning, semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation; shows 7.12% accuracy gain with 7% unlearning time across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy leakage in multimodal systems (vision + radar) and limitations of existing unlearning methods that harm cross-modal performance and intra-class structure.

Method: Three components: (a) selective visual unlearning via inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual representations from original semantics; (b) cross-modal knowledge retention via semantic consistency to preserve other modalities' discriminability; (c) dual-set contrastive separation to isolate perturbations between unlearn and retain sets, maintaining performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show CCU superiority; achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% unlearning time relative to top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively unlearns targeted data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and intra-class structure, yielding better performance and efficiency; suggests strong potential for privacy-preserving multimodal learning; future work could expand to more modalities and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-FSRU combines FFT-based frequency spectrum representation with quantum-inspired retrieval-augmented generation for medical VQA, achieving higher accuracy and better explainability on VQA-RAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackling medical VQA requires aligning image and text understanding; existing methods struggle with noise, modality gaps, and interpretability; this work aims to boost performance and transparency by leveraging frequency-domain processing and quantum-inspired knowledge retrieval.

Method: Introduce Q-FSRU: process image and text features into the frequency domain via FFT using Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion (FSRU); integrate a Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) with quantum-inspired similarity to fetch external medical facts; fuse retrieved knowledge with frequency-domain features to enhance reasoning; evaluate on the VQA-RAD dataset.

Result: Q-FSRU outperforms prior models, particularly on complex image-text questions requiring reading and reasoning across modalities; the combination of frequency-domain representation and quantum-informed retrieval improves both accuracy and explainability.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain processing plus quantum-inspired retrieval is a promising route for robust, explainable medical AI, with potential to support clinicians through clearer, more trustworthy VQA systems.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models; forgetting relates to replay fidelity and Fisher-weighted parameter drift, highlighting complementary roles of replay diffusion and synaptic stability.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and

*You Zhou,Lijiang Chen,Shuchang Lyu,Guangxia Cui,Wenpei Bai,Zheng Zhou,Meng Li,Guangliang Cheng,Huiyu Zhou,Qi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDA enables cross-domain segmentation in federated learning by adversarially aligning feature representations across clients, improving generalization across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In healthcare FL, clients may hold images from different modalities due to resource imbalances or data issues, causing domain shifts that degrade segmentation performance.

Method: Introduce FedDA with feature-level adversarial learning to align feature maps across clients, within a federated training framework, mitigating domain shift.

Result: Experiments on three medical image datasets show FedDA achieves robust cross-domain federated aggregation, enabling single-modality clients to handle cross-modality data and outperform state-of-the-art federated aggregation methods.

Conclusion: FedDA effectively addresses cross-domain heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation and improves cross-domain generalization; code available on GitHub.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

*Xin Luo,Jiahao Wang,Chenyuan Wu,Shitao Xiao,Xiyan Jiang,Defu Lian,Jiajun Zhang,Dong Liu,Zheng liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a benchmarked reward-modeling pipeline for image editing (EditReward-Bench) and a family of reward models (EditScore, 7B-72B) to enable effective online RL; demonstrates that high-fidelity, domain-specific reward models can match or surpass proprietary VLMs and unlock substantial performance gains on base models like OmniGen2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-guided image editing struggles with complex edits and data efficiency. RL could help, but progress is blocked by the lack of high-quality, efficient reward signals. The work posits that a specialized reward model and benchmark are essential to realize RL in image editing.

Method: Develop EditReward-Bench to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Build EditScore models (7B–72B) through curated data and filtering. Employ self-ensembling tailored for generative signals. Benchmark against proprietary VLMs like GPT-5. Apply online RL to a strong base model (OmniGen2) using EditScore as the reward signal.

Result: EditScore closes the gap with proprietary VLMs; the largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 on the benchmark. When used as the reward signal, it enables efficient online RL, whereas large open-source VLMs fail to provide a learning signal. The RL-enhanced OmniGen2 shows substantial and consistent performance uplift.

Conclusion: A high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is key to unlocking RL for image editing. The paper maps a complete path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training, highlighting the potential of RL in this domain once suitable rewards are available.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

### [185] [MoReact: Generating Reactive Motion from Textual Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23911)
*Xiyan Xu,Sirui Xu,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoReact is a diffusion-based method for text-driven human reaction generation that disentangles global trajectory from local motion to produce realistic, diverse, and text-consistent reactions, addressing limitations of existing single- versus dual-entity approaches and introducing a novel interaction loss to improve close interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely on one person's motion to generate the other's reaction, lacking adaptive responsiveness and semantic integration of interactions. There is a need for models that can respond to diverse, dynamic interaction scenarios with semantic guidance from text.

Method: MoReact disentangles generation into two stages: first generate global trajectories guided by both the counterpart's actions and a descriptive text, then generate local motions conditioned on the global path. It is diffusion-based and includes a novel interaction loss to enhance realism in close interactions; experiments are conducted on data adapted from a two-person motion dataset, with a dedicated webpage.

Result: The approach yields realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match the counterpart's movements while adhering to the textual guidance, demonstrating efficacy on the adapted two-person motion dataset.

Conclusion: The method addresses limitations of prior work by separating global and local generation guided by text, achieving better alignment with actions and textual descriptions, and enabling adaptive, semantically coherent reactions in interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

*Yihang Guo,Tianyuan Yu,Liang Bai,Yanming Guo,Yirun Ruan,William Li,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gradient-norm based loss scaling can balance multi-task optimization without grid search, by aligning task gradients rather than adding complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unbalanced optimization in multi-task learning (MTL) degrades performance; existing optimization methods vary across datasets and rely on costly loss-weight grid searches. VFMs help initialization but don’t fix imbalance; more data is not a universal remedy.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis across datasets to identify factors behind optimization imbalance, evaluate existing loss-weighting methods and VC/ViGFs, analyze gradient norms of tasks, and test a gradient-norm based scaling strategy against grid-search baselines.

Result: Found that optimization methods perform inconsistently across datasets; advanced architectures still require grid-searched loss weights; Vision Foundation Models provide good initialization but do not resolve imbalance; simply increasing data offers limited benefit; a strong correlation exists between optimization imbalance and the gradient-norms of task-specific losses; scaling losses by their gradient norms achieves performance close to grid-search optimization.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics offers a more direct path to stable MTL than increasingly complex methods; gradient-norm-based loss scaling is an effective, practical remedy to optimization imbalance in MTL.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

### [187] [Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917)
*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MT-AdvCLIP enhances cross-task adversarial transfer in multi-task CLIP by using a task-aware feature aggregation loss to generate perturbations that transfer from fine-grained tasks (detection/segmentation) to the CLIP backbone, improving attack success across image-text retrieval, detection, and segmentation by ~39% on public datasets, without increasing perturbation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess CLIP's robustness and generalization limits across tasks under adversarial perturbations; understand how adversarial examples transfer between coarse-grained (image-text) and fine-grained (detection/segmentation) tasks.

Method: Propose Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP) with task-aware feature aggregation loss; generate perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization; evaluate on multiple datasets against CLIP-derived models.

Result: Adversarial transfer success rate increased by over 39% on average across multiple tasks; effectiveness persists without extra perturbation budget; demonstrated on public datasets.

Conclusion: Reveals cross-task transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models; highlights implications for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design; motivates more robust defenses and careful evaluation in cross-task settings.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

### [188] [Token Painter: Training-Free Text-Guided Image Inpainting via Mask Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23919)
*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free Token Painter for text-guided image inpainting using Mask AutoRegressive models; introduces DEIF and ADAE to fuse text/background and adapt attention, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based inpainting models struggle to align fine-grained prompt details and maintain a consistent background due to whole-image latent modeling. MAR offers latent-token generation for localized inpainting, but naive MAR can ignore prompts or clash with background. Resolving prompt fidelity with background harmony in a training-free framework motivates this work.

Method: Propose Token Painter on MAR. Introduce two modules: (1) Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) to fuse semantic/text and background context in the frequency domain, producing novel guidance tokens; (2) Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) to dynamically boost attention on guidance and inpainting tokens during decoding. The approach is training-free.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms prior state-of-the-art across almost all metrics, delivering superior visual quality and prompt fidelity; code will be released.

Conclusion: Token Painter enables effective text-guided inpainting with MAR by achieving better prompt alignment and background harmony without training, thanks to the DEIF and ADAE modules that leverage background influence on text tokens and adaptive attention control.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

### [189] [Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23926)
*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes decoding/encoding directions for vision networks: decoding directions via directional clustering of activations; encoding directions via probabilistic signal vectors; leverages Uncertainty Region Alignment to exploit network weights; demonstrates ground-truth recovery on synthetic data and interpretable monosemantic concepts on real data; enables explanations and counterfactual interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretability of deep vision models by identifying latent concept directions beyond traditional reconstruction-based methods; uncover and align encoding and decoding directions to understand predictions and enable interventions.

Method: 1) Identify decoding directions by clustering activation directions in hidden representations; 2) estimate encoding directions as signal vectors under a probabilistic framework; 3) incorporate Uncertainty Region Alignment to leverage model weights for finding interpretable directions; 4) validate on synthetic data (ground-truth recovery) and real data (semantic concepts) and compare to unsupervised baselines; 5) use activation maximization to validate encoding directions; 6) demonstrate applications in explanation, debugging, counterfactuals.

Result: (a) On synthetic data, the method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data, decoding directions map to interpretable, monosemantic concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; (c) signal vectors reliably estimate encoding directions, confirmed by activation maximization.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable directions that illuminate global model behavior and support explaining individual predictions, with practical interventions to counteract errors or produce counterfactuals, advancing beyond reconstruction-based interpretability methods.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

*Yi Yang,Xiaokun Zhang,Qingchen Fang,Ziqi Ye,Rui Li,Li Liu,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-KnowLIP: a universal SAR multimodal foundation model built on a large-scale SAR dataset with geographic projections, HCoT annotations, and a self-consistent optimization loop; shows strong performance on 11 downstream tasks and 14 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of cross-modal SAR modeling; leverages SAR's all-weather imaging and geographic information; aims to provide a scalable data- and model- backbone and a unified evaluation baseline.

Method: Dataset: SAR-GEOVL-1M with 120k images from multiple platforms across 135 cities; Text annotations via hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT) producing >1M semantic labels; Model training uses Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization integrating contrastive, matching, and reconstruction objectives on a transferable multimodal encoder; Benchmark across 11 tasks and 14 foundation models.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP achieves leading performance, notably in object counting and land-cover classification, demonstrating strong cross-modal alignment and transferability.

Conclusion: This work advances SAR multimodal AI by providing a large-scale dataset, a transferable model architecture, and a comprehensive benchmark, accelerating development of SAR multimodal foundational models.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

### [191] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune is a training-free, complexity-adaptive token pruning method for vision-language models that uses mutual information to drive per-task logistic retention curves under a compute budget, achieving large token reduction with minimal accuracy loss and outperforming prior methods like PDrop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed pruning schedules and layer-wise heuristics fail to match the varying input/task complexities in vision-language models. Inspired by human visual processing, the approach seeks to align pruning with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory to reduce compute while preserving performance.

Method: Compute the mutual information between visual and textual tokens and map this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each curve is tailored to a specific task complexity, guaranteeing adherence to a predefined computational budget. It is training-free and plug-and-play, applied to models like LLaVA-1.5-7B, and evaluated on standard vision-language and Vision-Language-Action tasks. Code is released.

Result: On LLaVA-1.5-7B, AutoPrune prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of original accuracy averaged across tasks, outperforming PDrop by 9.1%.

Conclusion: Complexity-adaptive pruning is effective and practical, offering substantial compute savings with minimal accuracy loss without retraining, and is broadly applicable across V-L tasks.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D car-damage segmentation pipeline using 3D-Gaussian Splatting and a learning-free single-view projection method to uplift 2D damage masks into 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto insurance damage assessment benefits from faster, accurate 3D geometry; existing work is mostly 2D; 3D reconstruction from few views via 3D-GS can improve detection, esp. small damages visible in single view.

Method: Upscale 2D masks to 3D using 3D Gaussian Splatting; project Gaussians onto image plane using camera parameters from Structure from Motion; apply Z-buffering and a depth-opacity normal distribution for filtering; support a learning-free single-view segmentation; code is public.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in challenging single-view scenarios (scratches/dents) where multi-view approaches struggle; validated through experiments; code available.

Conclusion: 3D segmentation via 2D uplift with Gaussian Splatting is a promising direction for automatic car-damage detection and can handle single-view limitations where multi-view consistency fails; the approach provides a practical, low-data pathway for robust 3D damage analysis.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation (REG) is labor-intensive and hard to scale. ColLab addresses this by providing a scalable, automated data-generation pipeline that preserves spatial expressiveness and discriminability.

Method: ColLab introduces a Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy to leverage semantic understanding from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. It also includes a Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) module to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances, forming an automated data-generation pipeline. The framework was partly integrated into the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge data generation pipeline.

Result: Experiments indicate ColLab significantly accelerates REC/REG annotation and improves the quality and discriminability of generated expressions. The method was partially adopted in the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge, enriching samples for richer multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: ColLab offers a scalable, fully automated data-generation solution for REC and REG, reducing annotation labor while yielding higher-quality, more discriminative expressions and enabling broader, more realistic multimodal reasoning datasets.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

*Yang Ye,Tianyu He,Shuo Yang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLIR is a post-training framework for video world models that recovers input actions from generated videos via an inverse dynamics model to create verifiable rewards, enabling improved action-following with Group Relative Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models show improved visual quality and temporal consistency but struggle with accurate action-following. Post-training RL requires costly human preferences and rule-based verifiers, making it impractical to improve action-following; there is a need for verifiable reward signals.

Method: RLIR derives rewards by recovering actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model, mapping high-dimensional video data to a low-dimensional action space to produce a verifiable reward, and optimizes with Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Across autoregressive and diffusion-based world models, RLIR achieves 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores.

Conclusion: RLIR is the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of verifiable reward signals derived from inverse dynamics.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization and practical runtime, supporting potential clinical integration; explainability analyses bolster clinical relevance.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

### [197] [VFSI: Validity First Spatial Intelligence for Constraint-Guided Traffic Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23971)
*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based traffic simulator (SceneDiffuser++) often generates physically invalid trajectories; introducing Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) uses energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce constraints, achieving substantial gains in physical validity without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat physical validity as an emergent property, leading to many violations (collisions, off-road driving, building intersections). There is a need for architectural enforcement of physics at inference time, enabling scalable, safe traffic simulations.

Method: Apply energy-based guidance by integrating collision-avoidance and kinematic constraint energy functions into the diffusion denoising process. This model-agnostic approach guides sampling toward physically valid trajectories without retraining, evaluated on 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Result: VFSI reduces collision rates from 24.6% to 8.1% (a 67% reduction) and boosts overall validity from 50.3% to 94.2% (an 87% improvement). Additionally, realism improves (ADE from 1.34 m to 1.21 m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference via energy-based guidance is necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, and the approach is model-agnostic and scalable across urban scenarios.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

*Jinpei Guo,Yifei Ji,Zheng Chen,Yufei Wang,Sizhuo Ma,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS is an efficient one-step diffusion model with attention specialization for real-world video super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art results with substantial speedups (6.2x) and preserving pretrained knowledge via attention routing and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for VSR suffer from redundancy due to preserved content in low-quality videos, causing extra computation and learning burden; need efficient adaptation that maintains pretrained knowledge.

Method: Introduce attention specialization routing to assign attention heads to different patterns; use a one-step diffusion model (OASIS); adopt progressive training starting with temporally consistent degradations and gradually introducing inconsistencies.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world VSR datasets; 6.2x speedup over one-step diffusion baselines (e.g., SeedVR2); code release.

Conclusion: Attention specialization and progressive training reduce redundancy, preserve pretrained knowledge, and enable fast, effective VSR with diffusion models; potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

*Dongki Jung,Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free 360 monocular depth estimation via six-face cubemaps, perspective foundation models, and graph-based depth-scale alignment to ensure cross-face consistency and strong cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360 imagery is widespread but large-scale labeled depth data are scarce; depth scale inconsistency across cubemap faces hinders reliable 360 depth estimation; a robust, training-free solution that generalizes to diverse datasets is needed.

Method: Convert 360 images into six-face cubemaps; use a perspective foundation model to estimate depth and surface normals on each face; apply a graph-based optimization with per-face scale parameters to align depths across faces while preserving 3D structure, yielding a training-free, cross-face-consistent depth map.

Result: Achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluations across Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc; downstream benefits include feature matching gains of 3.2–5.4% and Structure-from-Motion gains of 0.2–9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: A robust, training-free framework for 360 depth estimation that enforces cross-face depth-scale consistency via graph optimization and leverages foundation models, enabling better generalization and practical gains in downstream 3D tasks.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal DL framework (TREAT-Net) combines echocardiography videos with structured clinical data to predict ACS treatment, yielding moderate performance and potential non-invasive triage benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACS diagnosis presently relies on invasive coronary angiography, which is resource-intensive, risky, and can delay treatment. A non-invasive, accurate prediction model could expedite triage and treatment, particularly in underserved areas.

Method: TREAT-Net uses multimodal deep learning with tabular-guided cross-attention to interpret echocardiography videos and a late fusion step to combine modalities. It was trained on a dataset of over 9,000 ACS cases comprising echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.

Result: Balanced accuracy: 67.6%; AUROC: 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement for intervention prediction: 88.6% accuracy. The model outperformed unimodal and non-fused baselines.

Conclusion: TREAT-Net shows promise as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate ACS treatment prediction, with potential to improve triage in settings with limited access to coronary angiography.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

TL;DR: SIE3D enables expressive 3D head avatars from a single image with text-driven control, via a conditioning scheme that fuses image identity features with text embeddings and a perceptual expression loss trained with a pre-trained classifier, achieving improved identity preservation and expression fidelity on consumer GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide fine-grained, intuitive, text-based control over 3D head avatars generated from a single image, while ensuring expressions accurately reflect textual descriptions and enabling efficient training on consumer hardware.

Method: A framework (SIE3D) that merges identity features from an input image with semantic text embeddings through a novel conditioning scheme. It uses a perceptual expression loss, supervised by a pre-trained expression classifier, to align generated expressions with text while preserving identity.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: SIE3D demonstrates effective text-driven control for single-image 3D head avatar generation, with an expression-accurate perceptual loss enabling faithful expression synthesis and efficient training on consumer hardware; a project page is provided.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Hang Wu,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A FrameMind framework that dynamically requests video frames during reasoning using FiCOT, trained with DRFS and DRFS-GRPO to adaptively balance temporal-spatial evidence collection, achieving SOTA on MLVU/VideoMME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling, which cannot tailor visual evidence gathering to the specific reasoning needs of each question, limiting performance on tasks requiring broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: End-to-end FrameMind framework employing Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) for multi-turn reasoning that can actively request targeted frames or clips. Trainable via Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) to expose diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without frame-level annotations.

Result: Significant performance gains over baselines on challenging benchmarks (MLVU, VideoMME), advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: Adaptive, RL-guided frame sampling integrated with reasoning enables effective, targeted visual evidence gathering and improves video-understanding performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperspectral generalized category discovery method using category subspaces (multiple basis vectors per class) with orthogonality and reconstruction constraints, outperforming RGB-based GCD on real HSIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI data is high-dimensional with rich spectral structure; existing GCD methods using a single prototype per class struggle to capture intra-class variability and inter-class separation in HSIs.

Method: Represent each category by a set of basis vectors forming a subspace; enforce basis orthogonality across classes to promote inter-class separability; enforce reconstruction constraints so each basis can reconstruct its class samples; apply this subspace-based GCD to unlabeled hyperspectral data to discover known and novel categories.

Result: On real-world HSIs, the proposed subspace-based GCD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods, demonstrating strong effectiveness for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral data.

Conclusion: First GCD framework tailored for hyperspectral images; the subspace prototype model provides expressive, discriminative class representations and establishes a foundation for GCD in high-dimensional spectral data.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction in hazy weather that fuses differentiable atmospheric scattering with topological pedestrian relationships, featuring an adaptive Mamba for faster feature extraction and a heterogeneous graph attention network, evaluated on ETH/UCY with a new dataset; achieving substantial gains in minADE/minFDE under dense haze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate physical information degradation and improve modelling of pedestrian interactions under hazy conditions to enable reliable perception in autonomous driving and ITS.

Method: 1) A differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation via learnable physical parameters to produce haze-mitigated features. 2) An adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction; the adaptive Mamba variant increases inference speed by 78% over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependencies. 3) A heterogeneous graph attention network to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, using graph matrices, plus a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture collaborative evolution. 4) A new ETH/UCY-based pedestrian trajectory dataset for evaluation.

Result: The method reduces minADE by 37.2% and minFDE by 41.5% compared to state-of-the-art models in dense haze (visibility < 30m); reports an 78% speed-up for the adaptive Mamba variant over the original Mamba.

Conclusion: Proposes a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems under adverse environmental conditions by integrating physics-based haze modeling with multi-granularity social interactions and fast, long-range feature extraction.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training on raw Bayer mosaics improves rain-affected image reconstruction over post-ISP sRGB pipelines, backed by a new Raw-Rain benchmark and an Information Conservation Score (ICS); results show higher PSNR/ICS and lower compute, advocating ISP-last pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid irreversible color processing, clamping, and blur introduced by ISP pipelines that degrade low-level reconstruction quality; demonstrate that learning on raw data yields superior results and can inform end-to-end camera pipelines.

Method: Compare raw Bayer-domain reconstruction with post-ISP sRGB reconstruction on rain-corrupted images. Create Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB. Propose Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric. Train/evaluate models on raw data and on sRGB, analyze PSNR/ICS, GFLOPs, and runtime.

Result: Raw-domain model achieves up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS improvement over sRGB on the test split, while running faster with half the GFLOPs.

Conclusion: The findings support an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and motivate end-to-end learnable camera pipelines that operate early in the imaging chain.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint end-to-end framework that couples superpixel segmentation with subspace clustering in HSIs via an unfolded-ADMM self-representation network guiding a differentiable superpixel module, yielding clustering-aware partitions and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computation and memory costs of subspace clustering on hyperspectral images by leveraging superpixel-based data reduction while ensuring segmentation aligns with the clustering objective; enable adaptive, per-superpixel segmentation.

Method: An unfolded ADMM-based self-representation network provides a model-driven signal that guides a differentiable superpixel module in a feedback loop; joint optimization learns both segmentation and clustering, with a per-superpixel compactness parameter.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark HSI datasets shows superior clustering accuracy compared with state-of-the-art clustering methods.

Conclusion: A unified, end-to-end framework can produce clustering-aware superpixel partitions that preserve spectral and spatial structure, with enhanced performance and adaptability through learned compactness per superpixel.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning-at-initialization of pre-trained vision models preserves zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks and, after fine-tuning, recovers or improves held-out task performance; this is attributed to favorable loss landscapes created by large-scale pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compress vision models before training without task-specific data, while maintaining transferability across tasks.

Method: Apply pruning-at-initialization to pre-trained vision models, evaluate zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, then fine-tune the pruned models on some tasks and assess performance on both seen and held-out tasks; analyze the role of pretraining-induced loss landscapes.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks; fine-tuning improves performance on seen tasks and can recover held-out tasks' performance.

Conclusion: Extensive pre-training yields loss landscapes that make pruning robust across tasks, enabling data-efficient, task-agnostic compression with recovery via fine-tuning.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

*Hosein Hasani,Amirmohammad Izadi,Fatemeh Askari,Mobin Bagherian,Sadegh Mohammadian,Mohammad Izadi,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounding IDs are latent, cue-induced identifiers that bind objects to partitions across vision-language modalities, enhancing grounding, reducing modality gap, and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with structured reasoning and precise grounding. Simple external cues like partitions and annotations help, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The paper proposes Grounding IDs as this mechanism.

Method: Perform representation analysis to detect robust within-partition alignment of objects to their external cues; use causal interventions to test whether Grounding IDs mediate the binding between objects and symbolic cues; analyze attention dynamics to show strengthened cross-modal connections; assess impact on grounding accuracy and hallucinations.

Result: Grounding IDs emerge as robust within-partition alignments in embedding space, reducing modality gap between image and text; causal interventions confirm they mediate binding between objects and cues; attention between related components is strengthened, improving cross-modal grounding and reducing hallucinations; provides interpretability and practical robustness gains.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs are a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues improve multimodal binding, offering interpretability and tangible robustness improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

TL;DR: VideoAR shows spatiotemporal cubes for autoregressive video generation that outperform frame-based methods, enabling faster, longer, and more coherent videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconsider whether frames are the natural atomic unit for video autoregression; aim to improve quality, speed, and scalability of video generation.

Method: A unified VideoAR framework supporting multiple prediction units (full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes), with cube-based predictions that operate across spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: Cube-based predictions yield superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence; surpass state-of-the-art baselines on VBench; faster inference; scalable to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: Encourages rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains, with potential broader implications for how we define tokens in spatiotemporal data.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFlow proposes a unified, efficient multi-modal two-person motion generation framework using rectified flow for deterministic sampling, a retrieval-augmented generation module for grounding via motion exemplars and LLM-based decompositions, contrastive and synchronization losses, achieving state-of-the-art in text/music/multi-modal motion generation with better quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities is challenging due to modality diversity, temporal coherence, and error accumulation in diffusion-based approaches; there is a need for efficient, semantically grounded multi-modal motion generation.

Method: Rectified flow enables deterministic straight-line sampling paths from noise to data for faster inference and reduced error accumulation; Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based decomposition of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythm; contrastive objective strengthens alignment with conditioning signals; a synchronization loss improves inter-person coordination; evaluated on text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal benchmarks.

Result: The approach yields consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across multiple modalities; motions are temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal human motion generation.

Conclusion: DualFlow presents a unified and efficient framework for high-quality, diverse multi-modal two-person motion generation, with strong grounding and coordination capabilities; the technique shows promise for advancing graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction applications; potential future work may include expanding modalities and further improving generalization.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified SVAC model for Referring Video Object Segmentation that scales frames and tokens and uses ASTC and CSA to boost performance with efficient handling of long videos; achieves state-of-the-art results with competitive efficiency; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RVOS: underutilized MLLM priors, heavy cost for long videos, and complex temporal dynamics; need for better video-language interaction and precise segmentation.

Method: Introduce SVAC; scale input frames and segmentation tokens to strengthen video-language interaction; Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) compresses visual tokens while preserving spatio-temporal structure; Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) allocates resources to handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on several RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: SVAC demonstrates that scaling and targeted token compression plus clip-aware allocation can improve RVOS performance while controlling costs; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine GUI grounding framework (GMS) that fuses a generalist vision-language model as a Scanner with a specialist GUI grounding Locator, achieving 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro, a 10x improvement over isolated components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding NL queries in GUIs is difficult due to diverse UI elements and the need for precise spatial localization; existing single-model approaches underperform. A human-like division of labor (scan then localize) can leverage both broad generalization and task-specific precision.

Method: Five-stage coarse-to-fine framework; a general VLM Scanner identifies potential regions of interest in the GUI; a fine-tuned GUI grounding Locator outputs precise coordinates within those regions; hierarchical search with cross-modal communication coordinates the two: stages include scanning, region refinement, and final localization.

Result: On ScreenSpot-Pro, the generalist Scanner and specialist Locator alone achieve 2.0% and 3.7% accuracy, but their integration yields 35.7% overall accuracy, about 10x improvements over strong baselines and demonstrating robustness across settings.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates strong potential for general-purpose GUI grounding by combining complementary strengths of general VLMs and task-specific models; the coarse-to-fine, cross-modal framework offers a scalable approach to GUI grounding that could extend to other interface tasks.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the time and subjectivity of manual retinal image grading and to provide scalable, explainable AI support for retinal diagnostics amid a large burden of vision impairment.

Method: Evaluate three pre-trained CNNs (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) on the Retinal Disease Dataset (21,577 images). Finetune VGG16 for 10-class classification. Integrate Grad-CAM to produce visual explanations highlighting disease-related regions.

Conclusion: EYE-DEX demonstrates strong accuracy and explainability for automated retinal disease classification, supporting potential integration into clinical workflows and enhancing clinician trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific
regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted
diagnostics.

TL;DR: AI-based beauty prediction exhibits strong ethnicity-based bias; cross-dataset analysis shows biases amplify rather than mitigate; very few inter-group comparisons meet distributional parity; mitigation strategies are proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight how AI aesthetic judgments can encode and amplify societal beauty biases, even with balanced sources, and to assess cross-dataset generalization to inform equitable beauty technologies.

Method: Comparative analysis using SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets; statistical validation with Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and post hoc Dunn analyses; evaluation on the balanced FairFace dataset; cross-dataset validation to assess bias propagation.

Result: Significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001) in both models, even on FairFace; cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation; only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfy distributional parity.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate; the work advocates mitigation strategies and discusses them in detail to pursue more equitable beauty technologies.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

TL;DR: FastVSR uses a high-compression VAE (f16) to accelerate diffusion-based video super-resolution, achieving ~111.9x speedup over multi-step models and ~3.92x over existing one-step models, with stable training via a lower-bound-guided objective and simple upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although sampling steps in diffusion-based VSR can be reduced to one, there remains substantial room to improve inference efficiency.

Method: Design a high-compression VAE with spatial compression ratio 16 (f16), develop its structure and a stable training framework, apply pixel shuffle and channel replication for upsampling, and introduce a lower-bound-guided training objective to stabilize training.

Result: Experimental results report large inference-speed gains (111.9x vs multi-step, 3.92x vs existing one-step models) and a stable training setup; code and models will be released.

Conclusion: FastVSR significantly boosts diffusion-based VSR efficiency while preserving stability, with open-source release planned.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

*Moxin Zhao,Nan Meng,Jason Pui Yin Cheung,Chris Yuk Kwan Tang,Chenxi Yu,Wenting Zhong,Pengyu Lu,Chang Shi,Yipeng Zhuang,Teng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatXGen is a radiation-free generative framework that synthesizes lateral spine radiographs from RGBD back images to estimate sagittal alignment in AIS. It uses a dual-stage architecture with an attention-based FFT convolution and a Spatial Deformation Network, introduces a large paired RGBD–lateral radiograph dataset (3,264 pairs), and outperforms GAN baselines in fidelity and metrics, offering a promising tool for sagittal spine assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for non-ionizing methods to assess sagittal spinal alignment in AIS. While coronal-plane, radiation-free approaches exist, sagittal assessment remains underexplored. The paper addresses this gap by enabling accurate sagittal morphology estimation from surface data and translating RGBD inputs into radiographic representations.

Method: A dual-stage framework that first infers lateral spinal structure from posterior surface geometry and then performs cross-modality translation from RGBD to radiographs. An attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module fuses anatomical cues from RGBD images and 3D landmarks to enhance consistency. A Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) models morphological variations in the lateral view. A large-scale paired dataset of 3,264 RGBD–lateral radiograph pairs is constructed.

Result: LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and surpasses existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data sharing is restricted by privacy regulations; dataset distillation aims to produce compact datasets that retain essential information, including information present in intermediate optimization states which terminal-state methods miss.

Method: Introduce a shape-wise potential to capture the geometric structure of parameter trajectories and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that prioritizes parameters by their optimization complexity; evaluate on medical image classification tasks; code released at GitHub.

Result: Improved distillation performance while preserving privacy; maintained accuracy comparable to training on the original data.

Conclusion: Leveraging intermediate optimization dynamics through trajectory geometry and staged parameter matching enhances dataset distillation effectiveness in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

### [220] [Combining Discrepancy-Confusion Uncertainty and Calibration Diversity for Active Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24181)
*Yinghao Jin,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning framework for fine-grained image classification that fuses discrepancy-confusion uncertainty with calibration diversity to select informative and diverse samples; it outperforms state-of-the-art on 7 FG datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained image classification has subtle inter-class differences, making it hard to judge which unlabeled samples are most informative. Existing active learning methods may struggle to capture directionality and diversity of FG samples.

Method: DECERN introduces discrepancy-confusion uncertainty to quantify category directionality and local feature-fusion stability, performs uncertainty-weighted clustering to diversify uncertain samples, and calibrates diversity to maximize global diversity while preserving local representativeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained datasets across 26 experimental settings show DECERN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods.

Conclusion: DECERN effectively identifies distinctive FG samples and enhances sample efficiency under limited labeling budgets, with potential applicability to other domains requiring fine-grained discrimination.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A radiomics-conditioned GAN+diffusion pipeline to synthesize diverse, controllable 3D tumor images across CT/MRI, enabling manipulation, placement, and radiomics-guided customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-driven data scarcity and the limited diversity of existing generative models hinder robust 3D medical image synthesis. Radiomics features are biologically meaningful and suitable as conditioning signals for controllable generation.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) a GAN-based model generates tumor masks conditioned on radiomics features; (2) a diffusion-based model generates tumor texture conditioned on the same radiomics features, enabling placement at arbitrary locations. The system supports removal, manipulation, and repositioning of tumors across four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) and two modalities (CT, MRI).

Result: The approach yields controllable, diverse tumor synthesis validated across four organs and CT/MRI. Synthesized images improve downstream task training, and expert evaluations support authenticity; the method shows potential utility in treatment planning.

Conclusion: Radiomics-conditioned generative modeling can produce diverse, realistic 3D tumor images with controllable attributes, offering practical benefits for training and planning, while enabling manipulation of tumor characteristics and location.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

TL;DR: A diffusion-model–based approach with prompt tuning that predicts post-NAC DCE-MRI changes from pre-treatment scans to reflect breast cancer response, aiding treatment planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early, noninvasive prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer by generating post-treatment imaging from pre-treatment data, thus guiding personalized therapy.

Method: Use maximum intensity projection (MIP) images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (3 or 12 weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images via a diffusion-model framework. Introduce prompt tuning to incorporate known clinical factors affecting NAC response. Compare with other generative models and perform ablations.

Result: The proposed model achieved superior image quality metrics and better reflected tumor-size changes associated with pathological complete response (pCR) compared with other models. Ablation studies validated design choices.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for precision medicine by enabling prediction of NAC response from pre-treatment data, potentially aiding treatment planning and decision-making.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion

affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.

### [223] [Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192)
*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaSe tackles a key bottleneck in vision-language models: text encoders that act as bags-of-words, failing to separate objects, attributes, and relations in complex queries. It introduces a hierarchical, compositional approach—Talk in Pieces to disentangle objects, attributes, and relations, and See in Whole to aggregate them—into a TaSe framework with a synthetic three-tier dataset. This yields a 24% improvement on OmniLabel, underscoring linguistic compositionality for language-based object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inability of current VLM text encoders to parse complex relational and descriptive queries, which leads to false positives in language-based object detection. The authors argue that disentangling linguistic components and structuring them hierarchically can better align textual representations with visual concepts.

Method: TaSe comprises three parts: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning category names, descriptive sentences, and beyond; (2) Talk in Pieces, a disentanglement module that decomposes text embeddings into core components—objects, attributes, relations—guided by a disentanglement loss; (3) See in Whole, an aggregation mechanism that combines these components into hierarchically structured sentence embeddings under hierarchical objectives.

Result: Empirical results on the OmniLabel benchmark show a 24% improvement, indicating that enforcing linguistic compositionality improves fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection.

Conclusion: Reinforcing hierarchical linguistic structure via disentangled, compositional text representations yields stronger inductive biases for VLMs, improving language-based object detection in complex queries.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D latent rectified flow diffusion model (T1C-RFlow) generates synthetic T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI, achieving high fidelity across glioma, meningioma, and metastasis datasets with much faster inference than prior diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) pose risks (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis) and variable GBCA administration can cause imaging inconsistencies. The study seeks a contrast-agent-free method to produce reliable T1C images from pre-contrast MRI to improve brain tumor visualization.

Method: 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow): input T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-FLAIR into a pretrained autoencoder to obtain a latent representation; train a rectified flow diffusion model in latent space to generate T1C. Dataset includes BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and metastases (MET) with train/validation/test splits. Compared against pix2pix, DDPM, and DiT-3D; evaluation uses NMSE and SSIM; inference-speed compared to other diffusion models.

Result: T1C-RFlow outperforms benchmarks in latent space and image space (GLI NMSE 0.044±0.047, SSIM 0.935±0.025; MEN NMSE 0.046±0.029, SSIM 0.937±0.021; MET NMSE 0.098±0.088, SSIM 0.905±0.082). It yields best tumor reconstruction and dramatically faster denoising (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps) versus 37.7 s (1000 steps) in latent space and 4.3 h/volume in patch-based image space.

Conclusion: The method can generate synthetic T1C images closely resembling ground truth with substantially reduced computation time, enabling potential clinical deployment of contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors; future work may extend clinical applicability.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

*Jiabin Luo,Junhui Lin,Zeyu Zhang,Biao Wu,Meng Fang,Ling Chen,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid presents a unified video modeling approach that fuses an MLLM with a diffusion decoder via a lightweight adapter to support both video understanding and generation, addressing semantic faithfulness and cross-modal attention efficiency. It introduces Temperature Modality Alignment and Pyramid Reflection for improved prompt adherence and temporal reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a single architecture that simultaneously handles video understanding and generation. Flow-based generation suffers from text-visual token imbalance affecting semantic fidelity, and uniform cross-modal attention across a video sequence is inefficient. Extending image-centric MLLMs to video is costly due to retraining demands.

Method: UniVid couples a large multilingual language model (MLLM) with a diffusion-based decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling joint video understanding and generation. It introduces Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence to visual inputs and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection, addressing cross-modal attention and temporal complexity.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, including a 2.2% improvement in VBench-Long total score over EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA respectively over the best prior 7B baselines.

Conclusion: UniVid demonstrates that a unified architecture combining an MLLM with a diffusion decoder, complemented by targeted alignment and efficient temporal reasoning techniques, can simultaneously excel at video understanding and generation, pushing forward unified video modeling benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA
and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

TL;DR: BALR-SAM: boundary-aware low-rank adaptation of SAM for medical image segmentation that updates 1.8% of parameters and without prompts, achieving SOTA performance with reduced resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models pretrained on natural images underperform in medical segmentation due to domain shift and resource-heavy fine-tuning. There is a need for efficient, low-resource adaptation that preserves or improves performance.

Method: Three components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention with minimal parameter increase; (3) low-rank tensor attention in the mask decoder to reduce memory usage by 75% and speed up inference. The model operates without prompts and fine-tunes a small fraction of the original parameters (1.8% of 11.7M).

Result: BALR-SAM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, on standard medical segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: Boundary-aware, resource-efficient adaptation of SAM is effective for medical imaging, achieving strong performance with minimal parameter updates and significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D delivers fast, feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation from uncalibrated sparse-view videos by streaming 3D Gaussian representations and predicting dense motions for novel-time synthesis, with self-supervised losses for motion supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D reconstruction methods are too slow or cannot synthesize novel time representations, especially from uncalibrated sparse views, limiting downstream applications.

Method: 1) Streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction from sparse views; 2) learnable state tokens to enforce temporal consistency across timestamps (memory-friendly); 3) novel-time synthesis via a dense motion prediction module predicting frame-to-frame motions for each 3D Gaussian; 4) occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion to interpolate Gaussians at arbitrary timestamps; 5) self-supervised dense motion supervision via dense point matching with a retargeting loss; 6) occlusion-aware optical flow loss for regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show Forge4D is effective for fast 4D reconstruction and novel-time interpolation; project page and code available for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Forge4D provides a scalable, online-capable framework that enables both novel-view and novel-time synthesis from uncalibrated sparse video inputs by combining streaming Gaussian representations with learned dense motions and self-supervised losses.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ introduces dual-modal masking MAE for audio-visual affective video analysis, enabling scalable pre-training and improved cross-modal correlation, achieving state-of-the-art results on 17 datasets across three AVFA tasks, with extensive ablations and released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVFA suffers from data scarcity and limited exploration of scaling in multi-modal SSL. There is a need to better model intra- and inter-modal correlations in scalable AV representations to boost performance and robustness.

Method: Propose AVF-MAE++ family of audio-visual MAE models featuring: (1) dual masking across audio and visual modalities; (2) enhanced modality encoders to support scalable pre-training; (3) Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module to improve cross-modal correlation in SSL; (4) progressive semantic injection training staged in three phases to ease adaptation and reduce overfitting.

Result: Achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks on 17 AVFA datasets spanning three tasks. Extensive ablations confirm the contribution of each proposed component. The authors also release code and models publicly.

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++ effectively advances scalable AVFA by improving cross-modal learning and representation through dual masking, correlation-aware SSL, and staged training, delivering strong empirical gains and reproducibility.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

TL;DR: A multimodal vision-language foundation model (EVLF-FM) unifies diagnosis and visual grounding across 11 imaging modalities and 6 specialties, with explainable, step-by-step reasoning; trained on 1.3M samples; validated externally; shows strong accuracy and grounding, enabling trust in clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models promise broad medical AI capabilities, but current systems are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning; EVLF-FM aims to provide a unified, explainable diagnostic tool with visual grounding to support clinical adoption.

Method: Develop EVLF-FM as a multimodal vision-language model. Train on 1.3 million samples from 23 global datasets across 11 imaging modalities spanning dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation with 8,884 samples from 10 datasets across 5 modalities. Tasks include multi-disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning. A hybrid training strategy combines supervised fine-tuning and visual reinforcement learning to achieve high accuracy and step-by-step explanations.

Result: Internal validation: highest average accuracy 0.858 and F1-score 0.797. Medical visual grounding across nine modalities: mean intersection over union (mIOU) 0.743 and Acc@0.5 0.837. External validation shows strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, competitive F1-scores with a smaller model. Hybrid supervision plus visual reinforcement fine-tuning yields explainable step-by-step reasoning aligned with visual evidence.

Conclusion: EVLF-FM represents an early, multi-disease vision-language model with explainability and reasoning capabilities, potentially accelerating adoption and trust in foundation-models for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step

TL;DR: Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR) enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space, projecting images into visual tokens and training the LM to reconstruct key tokens, improving perception-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs perform reasoning in language space and treat visuals as static inputs, limiting fine-grained visual understanding. LVR aims to fuse perception and reasoning by operating in a shared visual-language embedding space.

Method: A visual encoder maps images to visual tokens in a joint semantic space with the LM. The LM is trained to generate latent states that reconstruct critical visual tokens needed to answer queries, enabling latent visual reasoning. LVR is interleaved with text generation. GRPO-based reinforcement learning is adapted to optimize latent reasoning alongside textual output.

Result: Reported performance gains on perception-intensive tasks, e.g., MMVP achieving 71.67% versus 66.67% for a baseline (Qwen2.5-VL). The code and weights are to be released.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning in the visual embedding space enhances fine-grained visual understanding and perception without sacrificing language-driven generation; LVR offers a scalable path for integrating perception and reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

*Jinming Liu,Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural image codec tailored to MLLMs (CoTAM) reduces bandwidth by up to 35.99% without harming MLLM task performance, by adaptively protecting multi-level features using CLIP-based importance maps and a lightweight decoder adapter with multi-level loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs optimize per-visual fidelity for the Human Visual System (HVS) and fail to account for diverse downstream tasks in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Compression artifacts unevenly affect features at different levels, impacting downstream MLLM performance variably. There is a need for task-aware compression that preserves semantic and multi-level features relevant to MLLMs.

Method: Develop CoTAM (Codec TAilored to MLLMs). The encoder uses CLIP shallow-layer attention to generate an importance map for adaptive bit allocation, preserving semantically critical regions. The decoder incorporates a lightweight adapter and a multi-level loss to faithfully reconstruct both low-level details and high-level semantic context, enabling robust cross-level feature synthesis for MLLMs.

Result: Experiments show up to 35.99% bitrate savings while maintaining identical performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: CoTAM effectively tailors image compression to MLLMs, balancing fidelity across multiple feature levels and improving transmission efficiency without degrading MLLM task performance.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

TL;DR: Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S^2NNs) compress SNN weights to less than 1 bit using kernel clustering, with OS-Quant to handle outlier bias and MPFD to distill features, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than prior quantized SNNs and enabling edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks are energy-efficient but face scaling challenges; binary SNNs help but still demand significant storage/computation for large models, hindering edge deployment; extreme weight compression is needed to enable practical large-scale SNNs.

Method: 1) Establish an S^2NN baseline by clustering kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. 2) Identify and mitigate outlier-induced codeword selection bias with outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization (OS-Quant) that adaptively scales outliers. 3) Improve training via membrane potential-based feature distillation (MPFD) using a teacher model for precise guidance.

Result: S^2NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency across vision and non-vision tasks, demonstrating strong potential for edge computing.

Conclusion: S^2NN provides an effective compression/acceleration framework for SNNs, enabling more practical and energy-efficient large-scale deployment on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

TL;DR: Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM) uses cycle-consistent fine-tuning to improve conditioning fidelity and realism in diffusion-based medical image generation, showing better FID/SSIM on multi-site 3D brain MRI and enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address conditioning faithfulness and image quality gaps in diffusion-based medical image synthesis to support reliable direct and counterfactual generation across diverse datasets.

Method: Introduce a cycle training framework that fine-tunes diffusion models with cycle constraints enforcing consistency between generated and original images, improving adherence to conditioning.

Result: On a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, PPMI), the method improves conditioning accuracy and image quality as measured by FID and SSIM.

Conclusion: Cycle-based refinement is a promising approach for high-quality, conditioning-faithful diffusion-based medical image generation with applications in data augmentation, counterfactuals, and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [234] [Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skeleton-guided, corruption-resilient point cloud registration (SRRF) improves alignment under noise, density distortions, and deformations by integrating skeleton structures and a distribution-distance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds are corrupted by noise, density distortions, and preprocessing errors, and existing methods relying on direct points or surface features struggle under these perturbations; skeletons can provide globally stable structure for robust registration.

Method: Introduce a corruption-resilient skeletal representation; integrate skeleton alignment with point-cloud alignment; fuse transformations from both branches; design a distribution distance loss to enforce source-target skeleton consistency.

Result: SRRF achieves superior registration accuracy and robustness on diverse corrupted datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple corruption scenarios (density changes, noise, geometric deformations).

Conclusion: Skeleton-based registration with a distribution-distance loss yields robust, accurate 3D alignment under challenging corruptions and is promising for real-world 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

### [235] [Robust Partial 3D Point Cloud Registration via Confidence Estimation under Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24275)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A confidence-driven, global-context framework for robust partial 3D registration that jointly estimates overlap confidence and correspondence reliability to guide a differentiable solver, improving accuracy and robustness in partial/noisy scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial overlap, structural ambiguity, limited visibility, and noise make 3D registration highly challenging; there is a need for an interpretable, scalable approach that can down-weight uncertain regions and leverage context for robust alignment.

Method: CEGC combines (1) a hybrid overlap confidence estimator that fuses semantic descriptors and geometric similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers, (2) a context-aware matching strategy using global attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, and (3) a differentiable weighted SVD solver that uses these confidences to compute the transformation, enabling end-to-end optimization.

Result: Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes show CEGC surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization for partial point cloud registration.

Conclusion: The approach delivers an interpretable, scalable solution to partial registration under challenging conditions by tightly coupling overlap detection, confidence-aware matching, and a weighted SVD solver.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

### [236] [ASIA: Adaptive 3D Segmentation using Few Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24288)
*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA enables adaptive 3D segmentation of possibly non-semantic parts using few annotated in-the-wild images, leveraging text-to-image diffusion priors to transfer 2D segmentations to 3D, with cross-view loss, UV-space voting, and noise optimization; supports semantic and non-semantic parts with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D segmentation often requires heavy 3D data or multi-view captures; annotating 3D or multi-view data is costly. There is a need to leverage easily collected 2D images and powerful priors from diffusion models to bridge to 3D segmentation, including non-semantic parts.

Method: For each segment, optimize a text token; train with a cross-view part correspondence loss; render the 3D mesh from multiple views during training; at test time render multi-view, perform UV-space label fusion via voting, apply Noise Optimization, then map UV labels to mesh; uses few user-annotated images to guide diffusion-based transfer; can handle semantic and non-semantic parts.

Result: Reported outperforming existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations; demonstrates generality and robustness; effective on non-semantic parts and semantic segmentation; ablation mentions cross-view loss and Noise Optimization.

Conclusion: ASIA is a practical, generalizable framework for 3D segmentation with minimal annotations, leveraging diffusion priors to transfer 2D image segmentations to 3D, and achieving strong performance on semantic and non-semantic part segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

### [237] [SVGThinker: Instruction-Aligned and Reasoning-Driven Text-to-SVG Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24299)
*Hanqi Chen,Zhongyin Zhao,Ye Chen,Zhujin Liang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVGThinker introduces a reasoning-driven, incremental SVG generation pipeline that uses multimodal annotations and chain-of-thought fine-tuning to produce stable, editable, and high-quality vector graphics, addressing generalization and instruction-adherence gaps in text-to-SVG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between natural-language guidance and reliable SVG production by addressing weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions, while preserving the benefits of vector graphics and enabling precise, hierarchical editing.

Method: Render SVG primitives sequentially, annotate both the rendered image and the code with a multimodal model, and construct stepwise updates that mirror incremental primitive addition. Train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that exposes chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning to boost robustness and reduce errors/hallucinations, leveraging alignment with the visualization process and supporting the full set of SVG primitives.

Result: SVGThinker achieves more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVG outputs compared with state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining vector-graphics advantages and enabling precise, hierarchical editing and design automation.

Conclusion: The approach preserves vector semantics and offers a scalable path for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation by aligning LLM-driven generation with the visualization workflow and annotative feedback.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

### [238] [FrameThinker: Learning to Think with Long Videos via Multi-Turn Frame Spotlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24304)
*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Siyuan Huang,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker enables LVLMs to perform long-video reasoning by iteratively interrogating content and learning new actions (e.g., select frame) via a two-phase training (SFT then RL). It achieves state-of-the-art results with far fewer frames than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, leading to inefficiency and poor handling of visually dense content. There is a need to reduce processed frames while enabling dynamic actions to reason about long videos.

Method: FrameThinker introduces an iterative questioning framework for LVLMs over long videos, supported by a two-phase training strategy: supervised fine-tuning to instill action capabilities, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize a decision-making policy. The RL phase includes extensive exploration of reward designs for each action and its formats. The system supports new actions (e.g., select frame) to better adapt to video tasks. Evaluations are conducted on multiple reasoning and long-video understanding benchmarks.

Result: FrameThinker achieves a +10.4% average improvement over baselines and significantly reduces processed frames. The 7B FrameThinker model attains 76.1% accuracy on LongVideo-Reason using an average of 20.6 frames, surpassing LongVILA-R1's 72.0% with over 20x more frames (512).

Conclusion: FrameThinker delivers substantial gains in long-video reasoning, offering both higher accuracy and much greater efficiency, and sets a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason with far fewer frames.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

*Yuhang Cao,Haojun Yan,Danya Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa jointly optimizes explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats in an end-to-end framework, using a mesh-bound binding strategy, mesh constraints, and monocular normal supervision plus iterative mesh refinement to improve geometry-aware rendering, achieving state-of-the-art indoor texture-less reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods struggle with inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and decoupled mesh extraction limits optimization opportunities; an end-to-end approach that couples mesh geometry with splat optimization can improve reconstruction accuracy.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats. Gaussian splats have spatial attributes expressed in the mesh frame and texture on splats. Incorporates mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision to regularize geometry learning. Proposes iterative mesh refinement that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks; Chamfer-L1 reduced by 47.3% over the 2DGS baseline; maintains competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior indoor texture-less reconstruction limitations by tightly coupling geometry and splat optimization in an end-to-end framework, leveraging mesh geometry to guide optimization and refine mesh for better detail.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Motivation: Address scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization in cryo-ET subtomogram analysis; enable scalable, robust, pretraining-based solutions.

Method: CryoEngine generates over 904k subtomograms across 452 particle classes for pretraining; APT-ViT enhances equivariance via adaptive phase tokenization; NRCL stabilizes contrastive learning under heavy noise; evaluated on 24 synthetic/real datasets for classification, alignment, and averaging.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on all three subtomogram tasks; strong generalization to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable foundation-model framework for cryo-ET subtomogram analysis, enabling robust and generalizable structure determination.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

*Seungwook Kim,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaMatcher uses selective state-space models to efficiently model high-dimensional correlations for semantic image correspondence, achieving state-of-the-art with reduced 4D map cost via a similarity-aware selective scan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard semantic correspondence tasks are hampered by either feature-metric methods missing complex inter-correlation or correlation-metric methods being computationally prohibitive due to 4D correlation maps.

Method: Propose MambaMatcher leveraging selective state-space models to capture high-dimensional correlations; implement a similarity-aware selective scan inspired by Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm to refine the 4D correlation map while preserving feature map resolution and receptive field.

Result: Empirical results on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Efficient, accurate semantic correspondence is achievable by combining selective state-space modeling with a scan-based refinement, overcoming 4D map costs.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tri-plane-based multi-view counting (TP-MVCC) fuses features from multiple cameras onto a ground plane using tri-plane fusion to produce a scene-level density map, plus a new multi-view dataset for silkie chickens; it achieves high accuracy (95.1%) and robustness in occluded scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate counting of animals in smart farming is challenging in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views; effective multi-view fusion on a common ground plane can improve accuracy and robustness.

Method: Extract single-view features, align them via spatial transformation, and fuse them on a unified ground plane using tri-plane projection; decode a scene-level density map for counting; also construct the first multi-view silkie chicken dataset under real farming conditions.

Result: Outperforms single-view and conventional fusion baselines, achieving 95.1% accuracy and strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical potential of TP-MVCC for intelligent agriculture and validates tri-plane multi-view fusion as an effective approach for occlusion-heavy counting tasks.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

### [243] [Hyperspherical Latents Improve Continuous-Token Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24335)
*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR constrains AR model inputs/outputs to a fixed-radius hypersphere to prevent variance collapse in VAE latents, achieving state-of-the-art autoregressive image generation on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive (AR) image models struggle with variance collapse due to heterogeneous latent scales, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG); diffusion and masked models currently outperform AR methods, prompting the need for stabilization techniques.

Method: Apply hyperspherical constraints by using hyperspherical VAEs so that all AR inputs and outputs (including after CFG) have fixed L2 norm. The approach removes the scale component responsible for variance collapse, with raster-order AR implemented at multiple scales (SphereAR-H, -L, -B).

Result: On ImageNet, SphereAR-H achieves FID 1.34; SphereAR-L 1.54; SphereAR-B 1.92, matching or exceeding larger baselines like MAR-H and VAR-d30, and surpassing diffusion/masked models at comparable parameter scales.

Conclusion: Hyperspherical constraints stabilize AR decoding by removing the scale factor causing variance collapse, enabling pure next-token AR image generation to outperform diffusion and masked models at similar scales.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

*Yan Ke,Xin Yu,Heming Du,Scott Chapman,Helen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-reflective, self-improving multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering (QA) using four roles—Retriever, Reflector, Answerer, and Improver—to handle multi-image inputs, external context, and iterative quality control; achieves competitive results on AgMMU benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agricultural QA approaches are often restricted to text-only queries or single-image inputs and rely on limited external context, hindering performance in real-world scenarios. There is a need for multi-image reasoning across spatial scales and growth stages, robust context enrichment, and systematic quality checks to adapt when evidence is incomplete.

Method: Introduce a four-agent system: Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information; Reflector evaluates adequacy and triggers reformulation and renewed retrieval; two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias; Improver refines answers through iterative checks and ensures alignment of information from multiple images.

Result: Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show competitive performance for multi-image agricultural QA.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the gap in agricultural QA by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, multiple drafts, and iterative improvement, with effective multi-image alignment to support real-world applications.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

### [245] [NeRV-Diffusion: Diffuse Implicit Neural Representations for Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24353)
*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage NeRV-Diffusion model encodes videos into implicit neural representation (INR) weights via a hypernetwork tokenizer and denoises them with an implicit diffusion transformer, enabling high-quality, coherent video synthesis with smooth interpolations while avoiding per-frame tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Represent videos compactly as neural network weights to facilitate efficient, coherent generation and reduce temporal modeling complexity, aiming to surpass INR-based methods and approach non-implicit SOTA performance on real-world benchmarks.

Method: 1) A hypernetwork-based tokenizer converts raw video pixels into a bottleneck latent that serves as the INR weights; 2) An implicit diffusion Transformer denoises the INR latent. The bottleneck latent is reused across NeRV layers; the model redefines weight assignment, upsampling connections, and input coordinates. Training uses SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling. Decoding is performed with dedicated decoders, enabling a holistic video generation without temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser.

Result: NeRV-Diffusion achieves superior quality compared with prior INR-based models and is comparable to state-of-the-art non-implicit models on benchmarks like UCF-101 and Kinetics-600; it produces a smooth INR weight space enabling seamless frame or video interpolations.

Conclusion: Implicit latent video diffusion via a hypernetwork-tokenized INR can deliver high-quality video synthesis, offering a compelling alternative to frame-wise tokenization and opening pathways for efficient and continuous interpolations.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

### [246] [An Enhanced Pyramid Feature Network Based on Long-Range Dependencies for Multi-Organ Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24358)
*Dayu Tan,Cheng Kong,Yansen Su,Hai Chen,Dongliang Yang,Junfeng Xia,Chunhou Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamFormer is a U-shaped network for multi-organ segmentation that uses Linear Attention Mamba in a pyramid encoder, a Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to fuse multi-scale encoder features, and a Reduced Transformer (RT) to globally model up-sampled features, aiming to balance long-range dependency modeling with local detail while reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at long-range dependency modeling but are computationally expensive and can miss fine-grained local details. For fine-grained, multi-organ segmentation, there is a need for architectures that efficiently capture both global context and local information.

Method: LamFormer integrates an enhanced pyramid encoder with Linear Attention Mamba to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies. It introduces PHFA to aggregate features from different encoder layers to narrow semantic gaps and filter information. A Reduced Transformer (RT) module globally models up-sampled features using a distinct, presumably more efficient computation strategy. The network has a U-shaped architecture designed for segmentation and claims improvements in both performance and efficiency, evaluated across seven diverse datasets.

Result: LamFormer outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance. It achieves a favorable balance between model performance and model complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer offers an efficient, high-performance framework for fine-grained multi-organ segmentation, effectively combining long-range dependency modeling with robust local detail extraction while maintaining manageable computational requirements.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [247] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT introduces gradient divergence through a stochastic, learnable filtering ensemble to disrupt transferability of adversarial perturbations, achieving strong robustness with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples transfer across models due to gradient consensus under randomized transformations. Breaking consensus could reduce transferability without relying on gradient masking.

Method: Train a lightweight, stochastic filter ensemble (DRIFT) to maximize divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Use a consensus-divergence training strategy with prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness, forming an efficient defense applied in preprocessing.

Result: On ImageNet with CNNs and Vision Transformers, DRIFT yields substantial robustness gains and outperforms state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks, with negligible runtime/memory cost.

Conclusion: Gradient divergence through curated stochastic filtering is a practical, generalizable defense principle that challenges gradient consensus and reduces adversarial transferability without heavy costs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

*Hao Yang,Weijie Qiu,Ru Zhang,Zhou Fang,Ruichao Mao,Xiaoyu Lin,Maji Huang,Zhaosong Huang,Teng Guo,Shuoyang Liu,Hai Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-UG is a unified multimodal LLM for UI understanding and generation, achieving SOTA UI understanding via SFT+GRPO and strong UI generation via DPO, with a DSL-driven industrial workflow; it outperforms large general MLLMs on understanding and matches larger models on generation at lower cost, with mutual task benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific UI tasks still lag when using general MLLMs, in terms of understanding accuracy and generation quality. A unified UI-focused model with an industry-friendly workflow is needed to improve performance and deployment efficiency.

Method: Employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained UI understanding; use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for generation; introduce a domain-specific language (DSL), training strategies, rendering pipeline, and evaluation metrics; compare against larger MLLMs and UI-specialized baselines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UI understanding tasks, outperforming larger general MLLMs and similar UI-specialized models; matches larger MLLMs in UI generation at a fraction of computational cost; integrating understanding and generation improves accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Conclusion: Jointly addressing UI understanding and generation with a domain-specific workflow and DSL enables efficient, high-quality UI-centric AI, with strong potential for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

### [249] [Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365)
*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X introduces a middle-shared, two-end-separated architecture for unified multimodal models to mitigate gradient conflicts between vision and text. The approach dedicates early and late layers to modality-specific processing while sharing middle layers for high-level fusion, aiming to improve training efficiency and parameter efficiency. Empirically, it claims superior efficiency and competitive performance at 3B params, matching or surpassing 7B AR-based UMMs, with GenEval 82 for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and alleviate gradient conflicts arising from training modality-shared transformers on heterogeneous low-level statistics of images and text, which hinder joint learning and scaling.

Method: Propose Uni-X: an X-shaped architecture with initial and final layers modality-specific and middle layers shared. Gradient conflicts at ends eliminated; residual conflicts in shared layers reduced. Train under identical conditions; scale to 3B parameters with larger data; evaluate on image generation (GenEval) and vision/text understanding.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines in training efficiency. 3B-parameter Uni-X with more data matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving GenEval score 82 for image generation and strong performance in related tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X is a parameter-efficient, scalable foundation for unified multimodal modeling, effectively mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling competitive performance with fewer parameters. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

### [250] [Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24367)
*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free model-merging method (R^2M) that aligns multiple deepfake detectors to a shared Real representation and merges per-generator residuals, enabling robust, incremental detection across datasets without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. Different specialists share the same real-vs-fake decision but differ in generator-specific artifacts; simple weight averaging suggests a path, as Real features are preserved while fake cues are attenuated.

Method: Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R^2M): a training-free, parameter-space merging framework. It estimates a shared Real component via low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent dominance by any single generator. The approach argues that a simple head suffices because the Real component yields a common separation direction, while truncated residuals introduce only minor off-axis variation. It is composable: adding a new forgery family involves fine-tuning a specialist and re-merging without full retraining.

Result: Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset evaluations, R^2M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: R^2M offers a simple, training-free, composable mechanism to merge deepfake detectors by leveraging a shared Real representation and controlled residuals, enabling effective incremental updates and improved cross-domain performance without retraining.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

### [251] [From Satellite to Street: A Hybrid Framework Integrating Stable Diffusion and PanoGAN for Consistent Cross-View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24369)
*Khawlah Bajbaa,Abbas Anwar,Muhammad Saqib,Hafeez Anwar,Nabin Sharma,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid diffusion-GAN framework for cross-view street-view synthesis from satellite imagery, using a dual-branch, multi-stage training setup with fusion, achieving superior diffusion-only baselines and competitive GAN-based methods on CVUSA, while preserving geometric consistency and fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthesize realistic, geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery to enable urban analytics and geospatial data collection, addressing the large appearance and viewpoint gap between the two domains.

Method: Core model is a diffusion-based architecture (Stable Diffusion) deployed in a dual-branch setup; integrated a conditional GAN to enforce geographic consistency for panoramic street views; a multi-stage training strategy; a fusion mechanism to leverage strengths of both models; evaluated on the Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset.

Result: The hybrid framework outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics and is competitive with state-of-the-art GAN-based methods; it generates realistic, geometrically consistent street-view imagery while preserving fine-grained details such as street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements like clouds.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion with GANs in a dual-branch, multi-stage training framework with a fusion strategy yields improved geometric consistency and visual quality for cross-view synthesis from satellite images, demonstrated on CVUSA with strong qualitative and quantitative performance.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

### [252] [DINOReg: Strong Point Cloud Registration with Vision Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24370)
*Congjia Chen,Yufu Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOReg: a patch-level fusion of DINOv2 visual features with geometric features for RGB-D point cloud registration, achieving large gains on RGBD-3DMatch/LoMatch by using mixed image and point-cloud positional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D registration methods mainly rely on geometric cues and often fuse image data in lossy ways, failing to fully exploit rich texture, semantics, and global context available in images. A better fusion of visual and geometric information at a fine-grained level could significantly improve registration robustness and accuracy.

Method: Extract visual features from images with DINOv2 and fuse them with geometric features at the patch level. Introduce a mixed positional embedding that encodes both image-space and point-cloud-space coordinates to better capture cross-modality spatial relationships.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch. Code released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that leveraging vision foundation-model features and a patch-level, mixed-embedding fusion with geometry leads to robust and accurate RGB-D point cloud registration, surpassing geometry-only and prior multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

*Hao Chen,Fang Xu,Tamer Saleh,Weifeng Hao,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MCAE, a clustering-based annotation approach that exploits spatial autocorrelation to efficiently label submeter imagery, enabling a large HiCity-LC dataset and city-scale maps with high accuracy; first public submeter city-level benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity and high cost of high-quality annotated submeter remote-sensing data for large-scale land cover mapping; existing labels are unreliable or expensive; exploit local spatial co-occurrence to accelerate labeling.

Method: Develop MCAE that groups semantically consistent masks as minimal annotation units; uses spatial autocorrelation to annotate multiple instances simultaneously; achieves 1–2 orders of magnitude efficiency gains; builds dataset HiCity-LC (~14B labeled pixels).

Result: HiCity-LC contains about 14 billion labeled pixels; enables city-scale land cover maps for five major Chinese cities; classification accuracy >85%.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalable, high-quality annotation for submeter imagery and provides the first publicly available submeter city-level benchmark; suitable for large-scale land cover mapping; dataset and tool available online.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

### [254] [REALIGN: Regularized Procedure Alignment with Matching Video Embeddings via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24382)
*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN introduces Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein OT for self-supervised procedural learning, jointly aligning frames and modeling temporal relations under partial, non-monotonic conditions. It handles irrelevant frames, repeats, and out-of-order steps, delivering robust performance and interpretable transport maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural videos pose challenges for self-supervised learning due to background segments, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders. Existing methods (e.g., OPEL with Kantorovich OT) rely on feature similarity and monotonic assumptions, failing to capture higher-order temporal structure and allowing noise to corrupt alignments.

Method: REALIGN employs Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein OT (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme. It integrates FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning to stabilize training without additional regularizers, avoiding collapse to degenerate solutions while producing interpretable transport maps.

Result: On EgoProceL, ProceL, and CrossTask benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% gains in temporal IoU, demonstrating robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders; transport maps are interpretable and preserve key-step orderings while filtering noise.

Conclusion: REALIGN advances self-supervised procedure learning by effectively modeling temporal structure through partial, regularized GW-based transport, yielding stronger cross-dataset performance and more interpretable alignments than prior KOT-based methods.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

*Haijier Chen,Bo Xu,Shoujian Zhang,Haoze Liu,Jiaxuan Lin,Jingrong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D multimodal LLM that uses geometric priors and a Cross-Task Adapter to fuse 3D cues into a vision-language model, enabling real-scale 3D understanding from video without external 3D data, trained with two-stage distillation for fast convergence, validated on 3D QA, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. There is a need for video-based 3D understanding that can operate without external 3D data.

Method: Leverages geometric priors directly; introduces a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) to align 3D geometric cues with vision-language representations; includes a Metric Depth Model to recover real-scale geometry from reconstructions; uses a two-stage distillation optimization strategy to enable fast convergence and stable training; processes video inputs to avoid external 3D data.

Result: Demonstrates superior multi-task performance on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding across diverse benchmarks; extensive experiments verify effectiveness.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM offers a practical, scalable video-based 3D-MLLM that achieves accurate 3D scene understanding without external 3D data, preserves real-scale geometry via a depth model, and trains efficiently with distillation.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF framework extends SMIRK to MoreSMIRK for VRU situation classification in robotaxi ODDs, using space-filling curves to map multi-modal features to a dictionary; evaluated on PIE; open-source replication with MoreSMIRK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable detection and analysis of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban ODDs for robotaxis and robust evaluation across diverse VRU scenarios; high-quality labeled data and structured dictionaries are needed for training end-to-end AI and OOD detection.

Method: Augment SMIRK with MoreSMIRK as a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations; transform multi-dimensional scenario features via space-filling curves (SFCs) into characteristic patterns; match patterns to MoreSMIRK entries; validate on PIE dataset with 150+ annotated pedestrian crossing videos; release an open-source replication package.

Result: PCICF successfully identifies and classifies complex pedestrian crossing scenarios, including merged or split pedestrian groups; achieves computational efficiency via SFCs, suggesting potential onboard use for OOD detection; open-source MoreSMIRK and PCICF results.

Conclusion: PCICF provides a scalable framework for VRU incident analysis within robotaxi ODDs by delivering a structured VRU situation dictionary and efficient pattern matching, enabling improved training/evaluation and potential onboard deployment; the open-source package promotes reproducibility.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

TL;DR: RapidMV is a text-to-multi-view model that generates 32 views in ~5 seconds using a spatio-angular latent space, achieving better consistency and latency with competitive quality and text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating synthetic multi-view images from text is crucial for scalable 3D asset creation. Existing methods often struggle with speed, consistency across views, or alignment to prompts; RapidMV targets faster, more consistent multi-view synthesis.

Method: Proposes a spatio-angular latent space that encodes both spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations into a single latent. Trains the model in multiple steps (training decomposition) to improve efficiency and consistency. Produces 32 multi-view images rapidly (~5 seconds).

Result: RapdMV outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency, while maintaining competitive image quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables fast, consistent text-to-multi-view synthesis, facilitating scalable generation of synthetic 3D assets and streamlining the workflow with efficient training.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

### [258] [CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416)
*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A PTQ method CLQ for DiTs with cross-block calibration, orthogonal-based smoothing, and cross-layer parameter searching, achieving ~4x memory and speedups with negligible quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) achieve high generation quality but are large and slow; post-training quantization (PTQ) could enable edge deployment, but tends to degrade performance; need improved calibration, smoothing of activations, and cross-layer optimization to preserve quality.

Method: Three components: (1) cross-block calibration (CBC) to generate calibration data that better represents activation distributions; (2) orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS) that uses a block Hadamard matrix to smooth outliers in channel activations with low overhead; (3) cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search quantization parameters across layers; applied to DiTs for image and video generation.

Result: Achieves W4A4 quantization with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics on image and video generation models; reports ~3.98x memory saving and ~3.95x speedup; code released.

Conclusion: CLQ demonstrates that combining cross-block calibration, orthogonal-based smoothing, and cross-layer parameter searching enables effective, low-overhead PTQ of diffusion transformers, enabling edge deployment with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

### [259] [A Data-Centric Perspective on the Influence of Image Data Quality in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24420)
*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline to assess and improve image dataset quality using CleanVision and Fastdup, with automatic thresholding; shows non-uniform impact of quality issues and significant F1 gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model performance plateaus, data quality becomes a key bottleneck. There is a paucity of systematic, image-domain studies on evaluating and ensuring dataset quality.

Method: Identify quality issues in CIFAKE; build a pipeline combining CleanVision and Fastdup; introduce automatic threshold selection for detecting problematic images; convert low-quality image detection into a binary classification task with F1 as metric; assess deduplication for near-duplicate detection.

Result: Quality issues do not affect models uniformly; CNNs are resilient to some distortions but vulnerable to blur and severe downscaling. Automatic thresholding boosts F1 from 0.6794 to 0.9468 for single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 for dual perturbations. Deduplication improves F1 from 0.4576 to 0.7928.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow is effective for image data quality assessment and provides a foundation for more robust data-quality practices in image-based ML; enhancements yield substantial improvements in detecting low-quality images and near-duplicates.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

*Yuanyuan Gao,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Li Jingfeng,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Yanci Zhang,Dan Xu,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS introduces a fast occlusion-aware proxy for 3D Gaussian Splatting that prunes and densifies based on occlusion, achieving >2.5x speedup over Octree-GS and improved quality, with public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in current pruning/LOD methods due to lack of occlusion awareness, especially in heavily occluded scenes.

Method: A fast proxy generates precise occlusion depth maps at 1000x1000 under 1 ms. Use depth maps to (1) cull anchors/gaussians during rendering, (2) guide densification during training to avoid occluded inconsistencies.

Result: >2.5x speedup over Octree-GS; consistently higher rendering quality, especially in occluded scenarios (e.g., MatrixCity Streets).

Conclusion: Occlusion-aware proxy-based approach enhances efficiency and quality of MLP-based Gaussian Splatting; code will be released.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal optical flow framework that decouples modality transfer and flow estimation, leverages geometry-aware data synthesis with an outlier-robust loss, and enforces cross-modal consistency to achieve state-of-the-art results while remaining compatible with various flow networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal flow estimation faces modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment between modalities. Prior methods rely heavily on appearance similarity and often require ground-truth flow for supervision, which is unavailable in practice. The work aims to provide reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow and a principled way to align and fuse information across modalities, including building a cross-modal benchmark by repurposing public datasets.

Method: Introduce a decoupled optimization strategy that jointly trains a modality transfer network and a flow estimation network. Use a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline to provide reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, complemented by an outlier-robust loss. Add a cross-modal consistency constraint to jointly optimize both networks, enabling mutual improvement. Demonstrate compatibility with various existing flow estimation networks and evaluate on a repurposed cross-modal flow benchmark.

Result: DCFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches on cross-modal flow tasks, and can be integrated with a variety of flow networks. The proposed data synthesis, robust losses, and cross-modal consistency significantly improve flow accuracy on the constructed benchmark.

Conclusion: Decoupling modality transfer from flow estimation, coupled with geometry-aware supervision and cross-modal consistency, yields a flexible and effective unsupervised cross-modal flow framework (DCFlow) that generalizes across networks and improves accuracy on cross-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

*Ailing Zhang,Lina Lei,Dehong Kong,Zhixin Wang,Jiaqi Xu,Fenglong Song,Chun-Le Guo,Chang Liu,Fan Li,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, UI2V-Bench, evaluates image-to-video models on semantic understanding and reasoning (beyond quality and temporal consistency) using four dimensions, two MLLM-based evaluation pipelines, ~500 text-image pairs, and human alignment validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current I2V benchmarks emphasize video quality and temporal coherence but largely neglect semantic understanding of input subjects and compliance with physical laws and commonsense; there is a need for evaluating semantic comprehension and reasoning in I2V models.

Method: Introduce UI2V-Bench with four evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. Develop two MLLM-based evaluation pipelines: (1) an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and (2) a feedback-based reasoning pipeline for step-by-step causal assessment. Include ~500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluate both open-source and closed-source I2V models across all dimensions, supplemented by human evaluations.

Result: UI2V-Bench addresses the semantic and reasoning gaps in I2V evaluation, showing strong alignment with MLLM-based metrics and providing a robust framework and dataset to guide future I2V model development.

Conclusion: The benchmark fills a critical gap by focusing on semantic comprehension and reasoning in I2V models, offering a practical framework and dataset to support research and model improvement in image-to-video generation.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a single-image-driven hybrid 3D/2D framework that renders foreground objects in full 3D while synthesizing the background in 2D, enabling interactive, text-controlled view changes and progressive detail with superior WorldScore performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable on-demand, interactive worldbuilding from a single input image with high realism for explored regions, addressing inefficiencies of full global 3D generation and 2D hallucination.

Method: Employs object-centric 3D representations for key foreground objects while continuing to synthesize backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D. Uses a hybrid scene structure with advanced representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, supports natural language commands for controlling object appearance and dynamics, and progressively increases 3D detail as users explore.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark, with flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible animation.

Conclusion: NeoWorld delivers efficient, interactive 3D world generation from a single image, enabling natural-language control and progressive 3D detail to create dynamic, immersive, and coherent exploration experiences.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

### [264] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthesizes richer supervisory signals for VideoQA by moving beyond isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales, using QBP and QBC to train with a next-token objective; achieves state-of-the-art results and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA supervision is a bag-of-facts paradigm that fails to capture narrative structure and causal relationships in videos, hindering deep understanding and generalization.

Method: 1) Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP): create a holistic narrative paragraph by paraphrasing diverse inquiries (what/how/why) from existing QA pairs to reconstruct event structure. 2) Question-Based Captioning (QBC): generate fine-grained visual rationales grounding each answer to specific evidence. Train VideoQA models with a unified next-token prediction objective using the synthesized data.

Result: Significant accuracy gains and new state-of-the-art results on STAR and NExT-QA: e.g., 3B model to 72.5% on STAR (+4.9%), 7B model to 80.8% on NExT-QA. Improved cross-dataset generalization; QBP speeds convergence by >2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA models.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

### [265] [Generalist Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via Distillation to Two Heterogeneous Student Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24448)
*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A KD-based dual-model ensemble for general anomaly detection, combining a patch-focused Encoder-Decoder and a semantic Encoder-Encoder with a shared DINOv2 encoder, trained via Noisy-OR to produce joint anomaly scores; achieves state-of-the-art results across industrial and semantic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization gap in anomaly detection between industrial (patch-level defects) and semantic (semantic anomalies) tasks and single-/multi-class settings.

Method: A teacher and two student models share a pre-trained DINOv2 encoder. Encoder-Decoder targets patch-level industrial defects; Encoder-Encoder targets semantic anomalies. Noisy-OR objective guides joint learning. Anomaly scores combine local (patch) and semantic cues.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracies on eight public benchmarks in both single-class and multi-class settings; image-level AUROCs: 99.7% (MVTec-AD) and 97.8% (CIFAR-10). Generalizes across domains and tasks, often outperforming specialist models.

Conclusion: The KD-based dual-model ensemble bridges industrial and semantic anomaly detection, offering strong generalization and robust performance, with potential for broader AD applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot, inference-time optimization to control diffusion-based text-to-motion synthesis using Laban Effort and Shape components, by updating the text embedding during sampling to achieve target expressive attributes without extra motion data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained expressive control in text-to-motion remains difficult due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and the challenge of expressing qualitative motion attributes in natural language. Laban Movement Analysis provides a principled, interpretable vocabulary to quantify motion quality.

Method: Inference-time, zero-shot optimization that updates the text embedding of a pretrained diffusion model during the sampling step to align generated motion with desired Laban Effort and Shape components, without requiring additional motion datasets.

Result: The method yields diverse expressive motion qualities and preserves motion identity by manipulating motion attributes to match target Laban tags, demonstrated during inference without additional training data.

Conclusion: Integrating Laban components into text-guided motion generation enables interpretable, expressive control without extra data, offering a path toward richer, more controllable motion generation.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry-focused fine-tuning of multimodal LLMs via Euclid30K and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) yields transferable spatial reasoning skills, with notable gains across multiple benchmarks and surpassing prior state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence is a critical but underdeveloped capability for multimodal LLMs. A geometry-centric approach aims to endow models with broadly transferable spatial skills by teaching Euclidean reasoning.

Method: Construct Euclid30K (~30k plane and solid geometry problems). Fine-tune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 family using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage shape identification, counting, relational reasoning, and multi-step Euclidean deduction.

Result: Zero-shot gains across four spatial-reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, MindCube). Mean VSI-Bench accuracy rises from 34.5% to 40.5% (5.5 percentage points). RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6% accuracy, surpassing Spatial-MLLM. This suggests geometry-centric fine-tuning yields transferable spatial skills.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic study showing geometry-centric fine-tuning confers broadly transferable spatial capabilities in vision-language models; the Euclid30K dataset and code are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and

*Julio Hurtado,Haoran Ni,Duygu Sap,Connor Mattinson,Martin Lotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selective representation reduces fashion image databases to 10% of their size while preserving retrieval accuracy, via clustering, coresets, and a neighbour-homogeneity outlier score; validated on three DeepFashion datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle waste/emissions in fashion by enabling scalable, cost-effective second-hand image retrieval.

Method: Propose a selective representation framework: (1) clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples capturing garment features and intra-garment variability; (2) an efficient outlier removal step using a neighbour-homogeneity consistency score; (3) evaluate retrieval performance with progressively pruned databases on DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2; (4) compare against full-database baselines.

Result: Database size reduced to ~10% with retrieval accuracy near that of full-scale; clear performance-efficiency trade-off; outlier removal improves clustering and overall retrieval when applied prior to selection; substantial computation and storage savings.

Conclusion: Selective pruning and outlier-aware sampling enable scalable, accurate second-hand garment retrieval with much smaller vector databases.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples

### [269] [Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24491)
*Yuanshuai Li,Yuping Yan,Junfeng Tang,Yunxuan Li,Zeqi Zheng,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCPO introduces Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization for multimodal LLM alignment, addressing visual hallucinations by combining semantics, symmetry, and a curriculum. It uses a Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, a dynamic reference model, and a bidirectional objective to learn from both textual and visual preferences. Evaluations on LLaVA show superior results, reducing hallucinations up to 62.9% and maintaining generalization across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucinations in multimodal LLMs remain a core challenge, and while Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is common, it fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and can foster shortcut learning. There is a need for an approach that integrates semantic understanding, symmetric learning (textual-visual), and curriculum-based training to improve factuality and robustness.

Method: Proposes Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset that orders semantic contrasts by difficulty. Builds a progressive easy-to-hard curriculum (Semantic Curriculum). Uses a dynamic reference model during training and introduces a symmetric, bidirectional objective to learn from both textual and visual preferences. Trains on LLaVA models across scales; evaluates on hallucination benchmarks and general V&L benchmarks.

Result: SCPO achieves superior performance over baselines on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing hallucination rates by up to 62.9%. It also enhances factuality while preserving general capabilities, with stable performance across various general vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations and producing robust general performance across scales and benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

### [270] [Robust Multimodal Semantic Segmentation with Balanced Modality Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24505)
*Jiaqi Tan,Xu Zheng,Fangyu Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EquiSeg (EQUISeg) proposes balanced multimodal segmentation by equal encoding and mutual guidance. It uses a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block for efficient fusion and a Self-guided Module to adaptively balance modality contributions, improving robustness when a dominant modality deteriorates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal segmentation suffers from modality imbalance where reliance on a dominant modality causes performance collapse when others degrade; practical models need robust, balanced fusion across modalities.

Method: EQUISeg introduces four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block (CMTB) for cross-modal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus a Self-guided Module (SGM) implementing a mutual guidance mechanism so each modality can adapt its contribution, achieving equal encoding of modalities to balance their influence.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show significant performance gains and improved robustness to modality imbalance, validating the approach across varied conditions.

Conclusion: EQUISeg effectively balances modality contributions in multimodal segmentation, mitigating adverse effects of modality imbalance and demonstrating practical robustness improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

### [271] [Instruction Guided Multi Object Image Editing with Quantity and Layout Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24514)
*Jiaqi Tan,Fangyu Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes QL-Adapter for multi-object image editing, introducing ILFM and CMAM to enforce object counts/layouts and enrich text embeddings, plus QL-Dataset and QL-Edit task; achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-driven editing with CLIP struggles in complex scenes with many objects; need to ensure correct counts, spatial layouts, and diverse categories.

Method: Two modules: Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from CLIP image encoder; Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM) injects image features into text branch to improve instruction following; also introduces QL-Dataset and defines QL-Edit task.

Result: Extensive experiments show SOTA performance on QL-Edit and significant outperformance of existing models.

Conclusion: QL-Adapter effectively enables quantity- and layout-consistent image editing across diverse categories; provides a benchmark (QL-Dataset) to evaluate such editing.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

### [272] [CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24526)
*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Consistency Mid-Training (CMT), a lightweight intermediate stage between diffusion pre-training and flow-map post-training that maps solver trajectories to clean samples, yielding a stable, trajectory-consistent initializer and enabling fast, data-efficient training of flow-map models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training flow-map models (CMs and MF) is unstable, hypersensitive, and expensive. Existing pretraining helps but fails to provide a stable, long-jump initializer; a principled intermediate stage could bridge pretraining and post-training to improve stability and efficiency.

Method: Insert a compact intermediate training phase (CMT) between pre-training and post-training. Train a model to map points along the solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. This yields a trajectory-consistent initializer that can also initialize post-training. No heuristic tuning needed.

Result: CMT achieves state-of-the-art two-step FIDs: CIFAR-10 = 1.97, ImageNet 64x64 = 1.32, ImageNet 512x512 = 1.84, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time than competing Consistency Models. For ImageNet 256x256, CMT attains 1-step FID 3.34 with ~50% less training time than MF from scratch (FID 3.43).

Conclusion: CMT provides a principled, efficient, and general framework to stabilize and accelerate flow-map training, simplifying initialization for post-training and enabling strong performance with significantly reduced resources.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

### [273] [CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528)
*Mohamad Amin Mirzaei,Pantea Amoie,Ali Ekhterachian,Matin Mirzababaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive granularity refinement with SemanticSAM and a context-aware CLIP encoding boost 3D open-vocabulary semantic mapping, yielding higher-quality object masks and improved downstream 3D semantic segmentation and language-based object retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot 3D semantic mapping relies on 2D masks from vision-language models, which often are fragmented or inaccurate when directly projected into 3D. The need is to produce higher-quality, more complete masks and richer semantic context for robust 3D understanding in complex environments.

Method: Use SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating over-segmentation. Employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that aggregates multiple contextual views per mask with empirically tuned weighting to provide richer visual context. Evaluate on 3D semantic segmentation and language-based object retrieval across multiple benchmark datasets.

Result: Significant improvements over existing methods across multiple benchmarks, driven by better mask quality and richer semantic context, leading to more accurate 3D semantic segmentation and more reliable language-based object retrieval.

Conclusion: The combination of refined object masks and context-enriched embeddings substantially enhances 3D scene understanding for open-vocabulary mappings, with strong potential for broader applications in embodied AI and robotics.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

### [274] [Diffusion Bridge or Flow Matching? A Unifying Framework and Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24531)
*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified theory and experimental validation show Diffusion Bridge has a lower control cost and yields more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with limited data. The authors introduce a latent Transformer-based Diffusion Bridge and a matching model with the same architecture for fair comparison, validating claims across multiple tasks and data regimes. Code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is persistent confusion about which modeling paradigm—Diffusion Bridge or Flow Matching—is preferable, due to differing assumptions and implementations. A unified theoretical and empirical framework is needed to clarify relative merits across tasks and data regimes.

Method: Recast both models in the language of Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport. Prove that Diffusion Bridge minimizes a lower cost function. Analyze Flow Matching interpolation coefficients t and 1-t, showing diminishing effectiveness under smaller training data. Implement a latent Transformer-based Diffusion Bridge and a Flow Matching model with the same architecture to enable fair, head-to-head comparisons. Conduct comprehensive experiments across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer, varying distributional discrepancy and training data size.

Result: Theoretical claims are corroborated by extensive experiments. Diffusion Bridge exhibits a lower cost and more stable trajectories; Flow Matching coefficients lose effectiveness with smaller data; results align with predictions across tasks and data scales. The paper delineates pros and cons of each approach.

Conclusion: Provides a unified theoretical and empirical validation of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching, clarifying when each approach is preferable and enabling fair comparisons. The authors also release code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DBFM-3E8E/.

### [275] [Foggy Crowd Counting: Combining Physical Priors and KAN-Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24545)
*Yuhao Wang,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed crowd-counting method for foggy environments that integrates a differentiable atmospheric scattering model, a learnable edge-activation network (MSA-KAN) based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation, and a weather-aware GCN to adapt to visibility conditions, yielding substantial MAE improvements (12.2%–27.5%) in dense fog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foggy conditions cause long-range blurring, local feature degradation, and reduced contrast, severely harming crowd counting. A hybrid approach combining physical atmospheric modeling with data-driven learning can more accurately account for atmospheric effects and degraded features.

Method: 1) A differentiable atmospheric scattering model with dynamic transmittance estimation and adaptive calibration to capture depth-dependent haze attenuation. 2) MSA-KAN, a learnable edge-activation module grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, within a multi-layer progressive architecture with adaptive skip connections to enhance nonlinear representation in fog-degraded regions. 3) A weather-aware Graph Convolutional Network that builds spatial adjacency matrices from deep features produced by MSA-KAN to capture spatial dependencies under varying weather conditions.

Result: Experiments on four public datasets show a 12.2%–27.5% reduction in MAE compared with mainstream crowd-counting algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework that fuses physical atmospheric modeling with data-driven learning improves crowd counting performance under fog, leveraging differentiable scattering, adaptive feature representations, and weather-aware spatial modeling.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

*Zi-Yuan Hu,Shuo Liang,Duo Zheng,Yanyang Li,Yeyao Tao,Shijia Huang,Wei Feng,Jia Qin,Jianguang Yu,Jing Huang,Meng Fang,Yin Li,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeMoBench is a scalable, automated benchmark for VideoLLMs built around the Needle in a Montage task to test long-context recall and temporal grounding, featuring 31k QA pairs from 13k videos; 20 models were evaluated, and the data pipeline supports continuous updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for evaluation protocols that probe complex temporal reasoning in video-language models. Existing benchmarks struggle with long-context recall and precise temporal grounding, especially as VideoLLMs incorporate longer videos and richer reasoning.

Method: Develop a scalable automated data-generation pipeline that creates high-quality QA pairs for a Needle in a Montage task. Use this to construct NeMoBench with 31,378 QA pairs from 13,486 videos of varied durations. The pipeline enables automatic data synthesis and ongoing updates. Evaluate 20 state-of-the-art VideoLLMs on the benchmark.

Result: The data-generation pipeline reliably produces high-quality evaluation data and enables NeMoBench to be continuously updated with new videos. Comprehensive evaluation of 20 SOTA VideoLLMs yields insights into model capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: NeMoBench provides a scalable, updatable benchmark for evaluating VideoLLMs on complex temporal reasoning tasks, highlighting strengths and gaps in current models and offering a framework for ongoing evaluation as video data evolves.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed
to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context
recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for
our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that
facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we
present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task.
Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated
question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging
from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably
and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to
be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art
models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into

### [277] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap introduces a stealthier backdoor for LVLMs by corrupting object-relational understanding rather than inserting fixed targets. A visual trigger plus swapped tokens induce outputs that mention the correct objects but misstate their relationships (bags-of-words), achieving high attack success with strong evasiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-pattern backdoors are easy to detect because models memorize frequent triggers; there is a need for attacks that are harder to detect by exploiting the model's compositional understanding.

Method: During training, inject a visual trigger into selected samples and swap the grammatical roles of key tokens in the textual answers. Use an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize the swapped tokens, linking the visual trigger to the bags-of-words relationship disruption.

Result: TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple LVLM architectures and benchmarks.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates a more covert backdoor paradigm by attacking relational comprehension in LVLMs, revealing a vulnerability beyond fixed content and underscoring the need for defenses that detect manipulation of object-relationship understanding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces BFSM, a joint face-skull morphable model built from a 200+ sample dataset, with dense ray matching for topologically consistent registration and tissue-thickness modeling to enable one-to-many reconstructions and single-image surgical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scarcity of paired face-skull data, registration inaccuracies, limited reconstruction exploration, and underrepresentation of craniofacial deformities in existing datasets and models.

Method: Assembles a dataset of over 200 CT-based skulls and faces plus textured face scans (including rare craniofacial conditions). Develops a dense ray matching registration to enforce topological consistency across face, skull, and tissue correspondences. Proposes the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) with a shared coefficient space and tissue thickness variation to enable one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness and accuracy. BFSM enables 3D face-skull reconstruction from a single image and supports surgical planning predictions. Code and model are released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: BFSM provides a unified, tissue-aware framework for joint face-skull modeling and inference, improves inclusivity by including deformities in the dataset, and holds clinical utility for diagnostic and planning tasks.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

### [279] [Comprehensive Benchmarking of YOLOv11 Architectures for Scalable and Granular Peripheral Blood Cell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24595)
*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large, annotated PBS dataset (>298k cells across 13 classes) is released and used to benchmark five YOLOv11 variants for fine-grained blood cell detection. The YOLOv11 Medium variant provides the best trade-off with mAP@0.5 ≈ 0.934 on an 8:1:1 train/val/test split; larger models offer minimal gains at higher cost; dataset released publicly for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of peripheral blood smears is labor-intensive and subjective. There is a need for systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detection models on fine-grained blood cell classes and a publicly available dataset to advance hematology imaging research.

Method: 1) Curate and annotate a large-scale PBS dataset with 16,891 images and 298,850 annotated cells across 12 PBC classes plus red blood cells. 2) Benchmark five YOLOv11 variants (Nano to XLarge) for object detection, using two data splits (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and multiple metrics (mAP, precision, recall, F1, speed).

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieves the best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger variants (Large, XLarge) yield only marginal accuracy gains with much higher computational cost. The 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms the 7:2:1 split across models. The dataset is publicly released (github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) to support future PBS detection research.

Conclusion: A well-balanced YOLOv11 Medium model is effective for automated, fine-grained PBS detection, and the accompanying dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing hematology imaging research.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised, context-aware motion segmentation for elite javelin using Structure-Optimal Transport (SOT) to augment ASTGCN, enabling phase transitions detection without manual labels; outperforms baselines and provides a labeled dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise, scalable kinetic analysis in sports analytics by replacing manual labeling and lab-based instrumentation with an unsupervised, temporally-aware segmentation method tailored to biomechanical phases of javelin throwing.

Method: Extend Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) with Structured Optimal Transport (SOT) to capture temporal phase transitions in motion data; train in an unsupervised manner on professional javelin-throw sequences; evaluate on annotated test set; release a 211-video dataset with frame-level labels for approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Result: Achieves 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, surpassing competing unsupervised methods; validates effectiveness of SOT-augmented ASTGCN for phase segmentation.

Conclusion: An unsupervised, contextually aware segmentation framework (SOT-augmented ASTGCN) can reliably identify biomechanical motion phases in elite javelin throwing, reducing labeling costs while maintaining high accuracy; a new labeled dataset supports future research.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

### [281] [FreeRet: MLLMs as Training-Free Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24621)
*Yuhan Zhu,Xiangyu Zeng,Chenting Wang,Xinhao Li,Yicheng Xu,Ziang Yan,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet enables off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs to act as zero-shot retrievers by a two-stage process: fast semantic embeddings for candidate search and reasoning-based reranking, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are often used as generalists but require heavy post-hoc training to function as retrievers. The paper investigates whether pretrained, unmodified MLLMs can serve as powerful retrievers.

Method: A plug-and-play pipeline that (1) extracts semantically faithful embeddings bypassing lexical alignment layers, (2) conditions representation with explicit priors, and (3) mitigates framing effects via neutral framing. It performs retrieval in a first stage and reranking/generation in a second stage within a single model.

Result: On MMEB and MMEB-V2 across 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of data pairs, demonstrating strong zero-shot retrieval and end-to-end RAG capabilities that preserve generative abilities.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when harnessed with FreeRet's design, can function as strong retrieval engines without training, bridging their role as generalists and enabling unified retrieval, reranking, and generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

### [282] [Can you SPLICE it together? A Human Curated Benchmark for Probing Visual Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24640)
*Mohamad Ballout,Okajevo Wilfred,Seyedalireza Yaghoubi,Nohayr Muhammad Abdelmoneim,Julius Mayer,Elia Bruni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated, COIN-derived benchmark exploring event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions, with 3,381 filtered videos (12 categories, 180 subcategories) totaling 11,423 event clips. Humans and state-of-the-art vision-language models are evaluated on rearranging clips into coherent sequences. Results show humans outperform models; language descriptions improve model accuracy but not human performance, indicating models rely on language priors. Performance varies by reasoning type and task domain, with better results on temporal/causal and everyday tasks than contextual/spatial or specialized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively assess visual reasoning abilities of AI via video understanding, isolating multiple reasoning dimensions, and to understand the role of language priors in model performance.

Method: Construct SPLICE from the COIN dataset by human filtering; organize 3,381 videos into 12 categories and 180 sub-categories, yielding 11,423 event clips. Evaluate both humans and state-of-the-art vision-language models on a rearrangement task to form coherent event sequences, with and without human-annotated textual descriptions; analyze performance across sub-categories.

Result: Humans outperform vision-language models in rearranging event clips. Annotated textual descriptions improve model accuracy but do not affect human performance, suggesting models rely on language priors. Models exhibit relative strength when temporal and causal reasoning dominate, weaker on contexts requiring contextual/spatial reasoning, and perform better on everyday tasks than specialized ones.

Conclusion: Visual reasoning remains challenging for current VLMs; language priors contribute to improvements but do not bridge the gap to human-level reasoning. SPLICE provides a nuanced benchmark to guide future work targeting temporal/causal understanding and contextual/spatial reasoning, with attention to varied task domains.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

### [283] [RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24644)
*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces RIFLE, a diffusion-based method to remove image flicker-banding (FB) in photos of emissive displays, using a flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE), masked loss, and a synthetic FB generation pipeline; achieves state-of-the-art restoration on real paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding degrades readability and perceived quality in photos of emissive displays. It is distinct from moire and remains underexplored. Scarcity of realistic FB data motivates a dedicated restoration approach and synthetic data generation to enable training.

Method: RIFLE uses a latent diffusion-based restoration framework conditioned by a flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE). It incorporates Masked Loss (ML) to focus supervision on banded regions. A simulation pipeline synthesizes FB in luminance with jitter in banding angle, spacing, and width, plus feathered boundaries and sensor noise. A paired real-world FB dataset with long-exposure references is collected for evaluation.

Result: Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real data, RIFLE outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding.

Conclusion: This work is the first to study FB simulation and removal, establishing a foundation for future dataset construction and restoration model design. The authors plan to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

### [284] [Learning Object-Centric Representations Based on Slots in Real World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24652)
*Adil Kaan Akan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotAdapt provides an object-centric diffusion framework that adds slot-based conditioning and background tokens for images, plus Invariant Slot Attention and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator for video, achieving state-of-the-art object discovery/segmentation/editing and unsupervised video tasks while preserving pretrained priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a misalignment between global, text-conditioned diffusion models and the need for fine-grained, object-level control. A scalable approach is needed to imbue pretrained generative models with object-centric representation and editing capabilities for both images and videos, without losing their visual priors.

Method: For images, augment pretrained diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules to control each object, reducing reliance on text conditioning. For video, employ Invariant Slot Attention to separate object identity from pose and use a Transformer-based temporal aggregator to maintain consistent object representations across frames, enabling unsupervised video object segmentation and editing (removal/replacement/insertion).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, and compositional editing for images; demonstrates new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction; enables advanced editing tasks (object removal/replacement/insertion) without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Presents a general, scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for both images and videos, bridging human perceptual object concepts with pretrained diffusion models to enable interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools across creative, scientific, and practical domains.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently model complex visual patterns by combining discrete Volterra filtering (capturing nonlinear interactions) with continuous-time neural ODE dynamics, inspired by the brain's mix of discrete event processing and continuous integration.

Method: Proposes Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (VNODE), a piecewise continuous architecture that alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE-driven state evolution, integrating nonlinear Volterra filtering within a neural ODE framework.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance to current state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, with substantially reduced parameter counts and improved computational efficiency, as evidenced on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: Hybrid Volterra-ODE architectures offer an effective, parameter-efficient approach for image classification, suggesting that integrating Volterra filtering with continuous-time dynamics can capture complex patterns more efficiently than conventional deep architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven
state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while
requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and
Imagenet1K.

*Hanyu Zhang,Yiming Zhou,Jinxia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A classifier-centric adaptive framework enhances open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by augmenting the classification component with a lightweight text adapter and layered asymmetric initialization, yielding substantial gains on the OVCamo benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation hinges on generalizing to unseen categories; analysis shows the classification component largely dictates overall performance, motivating a targeted enhancement of classification.

Method: Introduce a classifier-centric adaptive framework that adds a lightweight text adapter to strengthen classification, coupled with a novel layered asymmetric initialization to improve training dynamics across layers.

Result: On the OVCamo benchmark, cIoU rises from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE decreases from 0.336 to 0.239 relative to the OVCoser baseline.

Conclusion: Targeted enhancement of the classification component via a text-adapter and layered asymmetric initialization markedly improves open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation, highlighting the classifier as a critical leverage point for future progress.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

*Ghanshyam Dhamat,Vaanathi Sundaresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions in T1-weighted MRI using an nnUNet-based pipeline with post-processing, achieving competitive Dice scores and ranking in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBI lesions are highly heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, which makes accurate segmentation difficult and affects downstream analyses like registration and parcellation.

Method: An automated segmentation pipeline built around multiple nnUNet architectures for initial lesion segmentation, followed by post-processing steps to boost evaluation metrics; evaluated on T1-weighted MRI data for the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge; implementation code is publicly available.

Result: Final submission reports accuracy 0.8451; Dice scores of 0.4711 for images with visible lesions and 0.8514 for images without visible lesions, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973; ranked among the top-6 methods in the challenge.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates competitive performance for automatic TBI lesion segmentation and highlights the effectiveness of nnUNet-based models with post-processing, while indicating room for improvement in lesion-specific Dice and generalizability.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video: a low-cost, high-quality long-video diffusion model using linear DiT with a constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention, enabling minute-long 720p videos from practical hardware, with faster inference and cheaper training than MovieGen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable high-resolution, long-duration video generation with strong text-video alignment at low cost and fast speed, addressing high training costs and memory constraints of existing models.

Method: Introduce Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency; implement a constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable autoregressive long video generation; optimize data filters and training strategies to reduce training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs.

Result: Competitive with state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B, SkyReel-V2-1.3B); 16x faster latency; deployable on RTX 5090 with NVFP4 precision; speeds up 5-second 720p generation from 71s to 29s (2.4x).

Conclusion: SANA-Video makes long, high-resolution video generation affordable and fast on consumer-grade hardware while maintaining competitive quality.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

### [289] [Enhancing Physical Plausibility in Video Generation by Reasoning the Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24702)
*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for video diffusion that enhances physical plausibility by explicit physics-aware reasoning and a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) during inference, using counterfactual prompts to suppress physics-violating content without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation models learn physical reasoning implicitly from large-scale text-video data, which is costly, hard to scale, and can produce implausible motions violating physical laws. There is a need for an inference-time mechanism to enforce physical fidelity without retraining.

Method: Use a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that encode physics-violating behaviors. Apply Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) to leverage these prompts via synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to reduce cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring implausible content is suppressed throughout denoising.

Result: Experiments across multiple physical domains show substantially improved physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite no additional training. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG contribute to gains, with the two SDG designs individually validated for suppressing implausible content and boosting physical plausibility.

Conclusion: Introduces a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that enforces physical plausibility at inference time without requiring training, by combining explicit physics reasoning with SDG-guided denoising.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, IWR-Bench, evaluates LVLMs on interactive webpage reconstruction from video, addressing dynamic web interactions missing in static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing webpage-to-code benchmarks focus on static screenshots and miss temporal dynamics and event-driven logic crucial for real-world web apps; IWR-Bench aims to evaluate multi-modal reasoning and code generation for interactive webpages.

Method: Design of 113 tasks from 100 real websites with 1,001 actions, including dynamic interactions (e.g., web games) and supporting assets. Uses an agent-as-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system to assess functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages, evaluated across 28 LVLMs.

Result: Best overall score 36.35%; functional correctness 24.39% (IFS) vs visual fidelity 64.25% (VFS), highlighting a larger gap in logic synthesis than in visual alignment.

Conclusion: IWR-Bench reveals critical limitations in current LVLMs’ ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven web logic, establishing a challenging frontier for vision-language research and providing a publishable benchmark and evaluation code.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with PET/CT images and reports, enabling improved VLMs for medical imaging in a low-resource language; first to pair Vietnamese PET/CT data with full-length reports and includes data augmentation and expert-validated tests, showing performance gains on report generation and VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key gaps: (1) scarcity of PET/CT data in medical VLM training corpora, especially for functional imaging tasks; (2) underrepresentation of Vietnamese and other low-resource languages in medical vision-language research, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Construct a large Vietnamese PET/CT report dataset (1,567,062 image pairs and 2,757 full reports), apply data augmentation, and design expert-validated test sets. Train and evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks such as medical report generation and visual question answering, benchmarking improvements.

Result: Demonstrates that incorporating the dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs on medical tasks; establishes the first Vietnamese PET/CT–report dataset and validates gains in domains requiring functional imaging and Vietnamese language understanding.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark advance robust, multilingual medical VLMs with broader modality support, enhancing clinical relevance for Vietnamese healthcare and serving as a foundation for future research in low-resource language medical AI.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource

### [292] [Collaborating Vision, Depth, and Thermal Signals for Multi-Modal Tracking: Dataset and Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24741)
*Xue-Feng Zhu,Tianyang Xu,Yifan Pan,Jinjie Gu,Xi Li,Jiwen Lu,Xiao-Jun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tri-modal RGB-D-TIR tracking framework is proposed, including a new RGBDT500 dataset and RDTTrack tracker that fuses depth and thermal cues with RGB prompts to enhance robustness beyond dual-modal tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based and dual-modal tracking struggle in complex scenes; adding depth and thermal modalities can provide complementary cues; need a synchronized tri-modal dataset and a tracker that can leverage tri-modal information efficiently.

Method: Construct RGBDT500 dataset; develop RDTTrack that fuses depth and TIR via an orthogonal projection constraint, then uses prompts to incorporate tri-modal cues into a pretrained RGB tracking model; leverages prompt learning to harmonize cues.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over dual-modal methods in accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Tri-modal RGB-D-TIR tracking with the proposed dataset and RDTTrack offers improved robustness and tracking performance, demonstrating the value of tri-modal fusion and prompt-based adaptation for foundation trackers.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

### [293] [ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758)
*Jiaqi Chen,Xinhao Ji,Yuanyuan Gao,Hao Li,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Dan Xu,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS is a feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) and GaussPainter to achieve extreme compression for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while preserving rendering quality. It combines re-optimization-free pruning (UGC) with diffusion-prior-based restoration (GaussPainter) to enable real-time, high-quality renderings from heavily pruned scenes, achieving over 100x compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting deliver high-fidelity renderings but incur large storage/transmission costs, hindering deployment in resource-limited environments. Existing compression methods trade off speed, generality, or quality. A data-driven approach that enables extreme compression while maintaining rendering quality and real-time restoration is desirable.

Method: UGC performs aggressive, re-optimization-free pruning of Gaussian primitives to retain essential information. GaussPainter uses diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned scenes, not only filling missing regions but also enhancing visible pixels. The restoration is lightweight (VAE + one-step diffusion) to enable real-time, end-to-end inference, forming an ExGS pipeline.

Result: The framework achieves over 100x compression (e.g., reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to ~3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and improving image quality under challenging conditions. It enables real-time restoration and demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion priors in bridging extreme compression with high-quality neural rendering. Code will be released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in reconciling extreme compression with high-quality neural rendering. ExGS offers a practical, real-time path to deploy 3DGS in resource-constrained settings, illustrating that aggressive pruning coupled with diffusion-based restoration can maintain rendering fidelity at very low storage costs.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

*Yizhuo Ding,Mingkang Chen,Zhibang Feng,Tong Xiao,Wanying Qu,Wenqi Shao,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematically compare perception strategies in multimodal LLMs and show explicit perception with textual cues as the most effective, then propose VTPerception-R1—a two-stage framework that decouples perception from reasoning to improve accuracy and robustness across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how to ground multimodal reasoning in perceptual evidence, and to provide an auditable, scalable solution for perception-grounded reasoning in MLLMs.

Method: Conduct a systematic study of four perception strategies (explicit, implicit, visual, and textual) across four multimodal benchmarks and two MLLMs. Identify best-performing strategy and propose VTPerception-R1. Implement a two-stage framework: Stage 1 perception-augmented fine-tuning; Stage 2 perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

Result: Explicit perception, especially when combined with textual cues, yields the best improvements, notably for smaller models. VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks. The approach is scalable and auditable, with code released at the cited GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception from reasoning and leveraging explicit perception with textual cues provides a robust, scalable path for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning and can be effectively learned via a two-stage framework (perception-augmented fine-tuning plus perception-aware RL).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

### [295] [SkyLink: Unifying Street-Satellite Geo-Localization via UAV-Mediated 3D Scene Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24783)
*Hongyang Zhang,Yinhao Liu,Zhenyu Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyLink proposes robust cross-view geo-localization by data enhancement, patch-aware local feature aggregation, and 3D-scene bridging with self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning, achieving 25.75% Recall@1 on UAVM2025 University-1652.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization suffers from semantic degradation due to extreme viewpoint differences; relying on direct feature similarity often fails under occlusion and viewpoint shifts. A robust retrieval framework that leverages semantic consistency and 3D scene context is needed to bridge street and satellite viewpoints.

Method: Introduce SkyLink with: (1) Google Retrieval Enhancement Module for data augmentation of street images to mitigate occlusion from restricted viewpoints; (2) Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation to emphasize multiple local feature aggregations and ensure consistency across viewpoints; (3) incorporate 3D scene information from multi-scale UAV imagery to bridge street and satellite views; (4) self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning for feature alignment.

Result: Demonstrates robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios; reports 25.75% Recall@1 on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge; code will be released at the cited GitHub repository.

Conclusion: SkyLink mitigates viewpoint-induced semantic degradation in cross-view localization and shows strong generalization across urban environments, with open-source resources to encourage replication.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be
released at https://github.com/HRT00/CVGL-3D.

### [296] [LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24786)
*Shenghao Fu,Qize Yang,Yuan-Ming Li,Xihan Wei,Xiaohua Xie,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 introduces adaptive zooming for long video understanding to balance temporal detail and spatial clarity, outperforming baselines by focusing high-resolution frames where needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding with LVLMs struggles due to fixed sampling that trades off temporal or spatial details; need for a method that can dynamically allocate resolution where necessary.

Method: Use a slow-fast adaptive frame sampling: start with densely sampled, small-resolution frames; when needed, zoom into clips with high resolution guided by multi-step reasoning. Train via 38k CoT data and decoupled reinforcement finetuning; break multi-step reasoning into single-step steps to supervise the zoom-in ability explicitly.

Result: On long video benchmarks, the model achieves a favorable trade-off between sampling density and frame resolution and outperforms Qwen2.5-VL by 3.1 percentage points on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive, zoomable frame sampling with explicit reasoning and decoupled RFT improves long video understanding, suggesting that variable-resolution perception guided by internal reasoning can surpass uniform sampling baselines.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

### [297] [Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24791)
*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs distribute visual functions across a few layers (Vision Function Layers); a Visual Token Swapping framework reveals layer-specific roles; alignment with human perceptual order (recognition before counting before grounding); targeted VFL-LoRA improves efficiency and reduces forgetting; VFL-select enables data-driven function classification and high data efficiency, surpassing expert selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how visual processing is distributed across layers in Multimodal LLMs to enable targeted training, pruning, interpretability, and data-efficient deployment in real-world tasks.

Method: Introduce Visual Token Swapping to perturb targeted KV cache entries during decoding to reveal layer-specific functions. Define Vision Function Layers (VFL) and map functions (e.g., recognition, counting, grounding) to layers across multiple MLLMs. Apply selective LoRA to VFLs (VFL-LoRA). Assess data selection by ablating VFLs (VFL-select) and compare to human expert data selection. Demonstrate that VFL-select achieves high data-efficiency.

Result: Visual functions collapse to two-to-three layers per function (VFL). Recognition precedes counting and grounding in the layer-order pattern, consistent across models. VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA and mitigates out-of-domain forgetting. VFL-select can automatically classify data by function, and using only 20% of data achieves 98% of full-data performance, outperforming human expert data selection.

Conclusion: The study deepens understanding of how visual processing unfolds in MLLMs, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models. It provides a practical framework (VFLs and Visual Token Swapping) for targeted training and data selection to bolster downstream capabilities.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

*Lei Tong,Zhihua Liu,Chaochao Lu,Dino Oglic,Tom Diethe,Philip Teare,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Chen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that freezes text-to-image diffusion backbones and enables causal counterfactual editing by injecting a causal module with two regularization strategies, achieving state-of-the-art attribute control and identity preservation on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering alone lacks explicit causal structure and controllable, generalizable interventions. There is a need to enforce causal relationships among attributes and to disentangle factors to prevent spurious correlations while preserving image identity.

Method: Introduces a modular Causal-Adapter that integrates with frozen diffusion backbones to allow causal interventions on target attributes. It uses structural causal modeling plus two regularization techniques: (1) prompt-aligned injection to align causal attributes with textual embeddings; (2) a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for attribute control accuracy and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation, indicating robust, faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

Conclusion: Causal-Adapter enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing by enforcing explicit causal structure and attribute disentanglement, while preserving core identity of images.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from unconstrained 2D photos, using a data rectifier to create clean multi-view images and a pose-correlated feature aggregation (PCFA) module plus a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor; claims state-of-the-art geometry and texture, fast (1.5 min per person), training-free multi-garment VIT, and code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior methods that require clean, well-calibrated inputs; enable reconstruction from raw, unconstrained in-the-wild photos with efficient, one-pass pre-processing and robust identity preservation.

Method: Data rectifier converts unconstrained inputs into orthogonal multi-view images in a single forward pass; PCFA fuses multi-image features with pose correlation; perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor removes need for pre-captured body templates; no heavy token-based optimization; supports arbitrary pose control and multi-garment virtual try-on; end-to-end pipeline with external datasets for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in geometry (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress); efficient (1.5 minutes per person); robust to unconstrained inputs; works with multi-garment VTO; code/models released.

Conclusion: UP2You demonstrates practical, tuning-free 3D clothed avatar reconstruction from wild photos with efficient data rectification and robust pose-aware fusion; paves the way for real-world applications and further research; will release code and models.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free token pruning method for large vision-language models that uses zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer to estimate token sensitivity, favoring high-influence and diverse tokens. It prunes up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.3x end-to-end speedup, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference costs from dense visual tokens in large VLMs and limitations of existing pruning methods (unstable attention scores, risk of dropping important regions). A lightweight, training-free mechanism is needed to identify influential and diverse tokens.

Method: Estimate token sensitivity via zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, requiring only light forward passes (no backprop). Rank tokens by sensitivity, encourage complementary (diverse) cues, and prune tokens accordingly in a training-free framework.

Result: Consistent improvement over prior pruning methods across multiple VLMs and benchmarks; capable of pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while preserving accuracy; end-to-end inference speeds up by up to 2.3x.

Conclusion: A simple, training-free sensitivity-based token pruning at a shallow projection layer is effective and robust for reducing computation in VLMs, outperforming attention- and diversity-based approaches and generalizing across models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: A physics-informed rPPG method (PHASE-Net) grounded in hemodynamics: a second-order dynamical system leads to a causal convolution, justifying TCNs; with three components (Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper, Adaptive Spatial Filter, Gated TCN) achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and robustness for non-contact pulse measurement under motion and lighting variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG accuracy degrades with head motion and illumination changes; existing deep learning methods are mostly heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, reducing robustness and interpretability.

Method: Derive a physics-informed rPPG paradigm from Navier-Stokes hemodynamics showing pulse dynamics as a second-order system whose discrete solution yields a causal convolution. Propose PHASE-Net with (1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper to mix distant facial regions while preserving temporal order, (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter to highlight signal-rich regions and suppress noise, (3) Gated TCN to capture long-range temporal dynamics in a causal, dilated network.

Result: PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, demonstrating that physics-informed design provides robust, interpretable, deployment-ready rPPG solutions.

Conclusion: A theoretically grounded framework for rPPG connects hemodynamic physics to causal temporally-aware neural architectures (TCN), enabling robust, efficient non-contact pulse estimation via PHASE-Net.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

*Jingru Qiu,Jiale Liang,Xuanhan Fan,Mingda Zhang,Zhenli He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELPG-DTFS introduces a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network for EEG-based MDD diagnosis, combining channel-band attention, dynamic learnable adjacency, and a residual knowledge-graph pathway to improve accuracy and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on MODMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDD screening relies on subjective scales, with EEG offering a low-cost biomarker. Limitations of existing deep models include treating spectra as static images, fixed inter-channel graphs, and ignoring domain priors, which hurt accuracy and interpretability.

Method: The proposed ELPG-DTFS uses (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable, dynamic adjacency matrix for functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway that injects neuroscience priors, operating on 128-channel EEG data. Evaluation on the MODMA dataset (53 subjects) shows superior performance to previous methods (e.g., ACM-GNN). An ablation study demonstrates each module contributes to performance.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 on MODMA; outperforms the previous state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation indicates removing any module reduces F1 by up to 4.35 points, highlighting complementarity and robustness.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS provides a robust, interpretable framework for EEG-based MDD diagnostics by integrating spectral-temporal representations, dynamic graph learning, and neuroscience priors, advancing noninvasive depression screening.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

TL;DR: DoG-based input preprocessing for semantic segmentation enhances robustness under adverse conditions (night, fog, snow) without sacrificing in-distribution performance; it's lightweight and model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness of semantic segmentation to adverse environmental conditions by biologically inspired input enhancement, specifically contrast enhancement and color opponency, applied at the preprocessing stage without changing model architecture or training.

Method: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to multiple input channels (RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels) as a model-agnostic preprocessing step. No changes to network architecture or training. Evaluate on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich to assess ID performance and robustness under adverse conditions.

Result: Preserves in-distribution performance while improving robustness to night, fog, and snow across the tested datasets. The preprocessing is lightweight and model-agnostic, enabling easy integration into imaging pipelines for downstream vision models in safety-critical settings.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired DoG preprocessing is a practical, low-cost approach to enhance robustness of semantic segmentation pipelines without modifying models, offering a plug-in solution for safer, more reliable perception in challenging environments.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

*Xiangyu Zeng,Kefan Qiu,Qingyu Zhang,Xinhao Li,Jing Wang,Jiaxin Li,Ziang Yan,Kun Tian,Meng Tian,Xinhai Zhao,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamForest introduces a streaming video understanding framework that uses a Persistent Event Memory Forest to organize frames into event-level trees with penalty-guided memory management, plus a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for short-term cues. It also provides OnlineIT for task-specific tuning and ODV-Bench for evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art results and robustness under token compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time streaming video understanding is limited by storage constraints on historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. A memory mechanism that can retain long-term information under limited compute, plus enhanced short-term perception, is needed.

Method: Propose Persistent Event Memory Forest that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level trees guided by penalties based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency. Introduce Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for short-term cues. Provide OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset for streaming video tasks. Evaluate on ODV-Bench benchmarks for autonomous driving scenarios.

Result: StreamForest achieves state-of-the-art accuracies: 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Under extreme visual token compression (1024 tokens), it retains 96.8% of its average accuracy across eight benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: StreamForest offers robust, efficient, and generalizable streaming video understanding suitable for real-time perception and future prediction in autonomous driving contexts, supported by a dedicated dataset and benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

*Nikos Kostagiolas,Pantelis Georgiades,Yannis Panagakis,Mihalis A. Nicolaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model for satellite imagery conditioned on text, metadata, and visuals; introduces a metadata fusion strategy to handle missing data and dynamic environmental conditions; provides a public 3-modal dataset; demonstrates improved fidelity and robustness over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based satellite image generation: limited environmental context, missing/corrupted data, and misalignment with user intent; leverage multi-modal conditioning and environmental context to improve quality and controllability for downstream tasks.

Method: A diffusion framework conditioned on three control signals: text, metadata, and visual data; introduces a metadata fusion module that models interactions between attribute embeddings to cope with partial/corrupted observations; validates on single-image and temporal generation; releases a public 3-modal dataset.

Result: Outperforms prior methods qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, responsiveness) and quantitatively (fidelity, accuracy) across six metrics; demonstrates effective generation under dynamic environmental conditions; first public dataset combining these three modalities.

Conclusion: Conditioning satellite image generation on environmental context via multi-modal controls improves foundation models; the approach is robust to missing data and more usable for downstream remote-sensing tasks; the released dataset will facilitate future research.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep CNN outperforms lightweight ensembles on a curated 16-class vehicle dataset; balancing helps ensembles but cannot fix the most underrepresented class, highlighting the need for more minority data and cost-sensitive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle severe class imbalance in vehicle type recognition to improve performance for intelligent transportation and logistics, by building a diverse dataset and evaluating balancing strategies and model types.

Method: Create six balanced variants using SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling; benchmark lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting with MobileNet-V2 features) against a ResNet-style CNN trained with strong augmentation and label smoothing; evaluate on full test set and an unseen inference batch.

Result: CNN outperforms ensembles, achieving 79.19% accuracy on the full test set and 81.25% on unseen data; the best SMOTE-based ensemble reaches 74.8% test accuracy; the most underrepresented class (Barge) remains a failure mode, underscoring limits of rebalancing alone.

Conclusion: Deep models offer superior performance, but rebalancing alone is insufficient for rare classes. Suggested directions include collecting more minority-class data and implementing cost-sensitive losses (e.g., focal loss), plus exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines that balance interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

### [307] [MMRQA: Signal-Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Models for MRI Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24888)
*Fankai Jia,Daisong Gan,Zhe Zhang,Zhaochi Wen,Chenchen Dan,Dong Liang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMRQA leverages multimodal LLMs to fuse acquisition-aware MRI quality metrics with semantic, QA-style reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance by robust metric extraction, QA transformation, and LoRA-based fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI quality assessment faces data scarcity and protocol variability. Quantitative metrics alone lack semantic interpretability, while deep learning methods sacrifice explainability. A unified framework that combines robust metrics with semantic reasoning can improve clinical decision-making.

Method: Three innovations: (1) Robust metric extraction via MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts for resilience; (2) Transformation of metrics into QA-style prompts using Qwen to enable semantic reasoning; (3) Parameter-efficient fusion through LoRA on the LLaVA-OneVision backbone to combine modalities with limited trainable parameters.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization; comprehensive ablation studies validate each component.

Conclusion: By bridging quantitative MRI quality metrics with semantic reasoning, MMRQA enables clinically interpretable outputs and strengthens quality control in dynamic clinical environments.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

### [308] [VAGUEGAN: Stealthy Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Image Generative Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24891)
*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN introduces a stealthy latent-space poisoning attack on GANs and diffusion pipelines, using PoisonerNet and a Generator-Discriminator pair to craft triggers that steer outputs with high stealth; demonstrates transferability to diffusion via ControlNet editing; challenges the assumption that poisoning degrades visual quality and reveals blind spots in pixel-level defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models are prevalent in imagery and editing tasks; while attacks on discriminative models are well-studied, targeted perturbations that influence generative outputs are underexplored and could undermine the integrity of generation pipelines.

Method: A modular perturbation network (PoisonerNet) combined with a Generator-Discriminator framework to inject stealth triggers. Evaluation uses a custom proxy metric, plus perceptual and frequency-domain analyses for stealth. The study also tests transferability to diffusion-based pipelines via ControlNet-guided editing.

Result: Poisoned outputs can rival or exceed the visual quality of clean outputs; latent-space poisoning can preserve or enhance aesthetics, countering the usual assumption that poisoning hurts fidelity. Attacks yield consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs and can transfer to diffusion-based workflows.

Conclusion: Latent-space poisoning reveals blind spots in pixel-level defenses and threatens the integrity of image-generation pipelines; defenses should address latent-space perturbations and consider detection mechanisms beyond pixel-level analysis; raises broader safety and integrity concerns for GANs and diffusion-based editing systems.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

### [309] [DWGS: Enhancing Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting with Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation and Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24893)
*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS is a unified framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view novel view synthesis by adding depth-estimation with multi-view consistency, virtual-view constraints, and occlusion-aware reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLFF, Blender, and DTU while maintaining real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view NVS suffers from overfitting, geometric distortion, and incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints; 3D Gaussian Splatting is fast but prone to floating artifacts and inconsistencies under sparse inputs. A unified approach that leverages robust structural cues, virtual views, and occlusion handling can improve fidelity and completeness.

Method: 1) Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation: combines dense matching priors with reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness to enforce multi-view consistency. 2) Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis: generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric constraints. 3) Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction: uses a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured regions.

Result: On standard benchmarks LLFF, Blender, and DTU, DWGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while preserving real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: DWGS effectively enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occlusion-aware reconstruction, addressing artifacts and inconsistencies to enable robust, real-time NVS.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

*Xi Chen,Hongxun Yao,Zhaopan Xu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM: a dual supervision framework for SFADA that fuses ViL-based multimodal guidance with sparse human labels via bidirectional distillation, achieving state-of-the-art results across SFADA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFADA relies on limited manual labels; existing approaches treat ViL guidance and data supervision separately, underutilizing their complementary strengths. There is a need to effectively fuse multimodal supervision to improve pseudo-label quality and feature alignment in unlabeled target domains.

Method:  DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and uses bidirectional distillation between the target model and the dual supervisions (ViL guidance and human labels) during iterative adaptation. The process leverages active learning to select a small labeled subset and integrates multimodal supervision to guide learning in a source-free setting.

Result: DAM consistently outperforms existing SFADA methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal supervision from a ViL foundation model with sparse human annotations via bidirectional distillation provides an effective dual supervision signal, enabling more accurate and robust source-free active domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

### [311] [Accurate Cobb Angle Estimation via SVD-Based Curve Detection and Vertebral Wedging Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24898)
*Chang Shi,Nan Meng,Yipeng Zhuang,Moxin Zhao,Jason Pui Yin Cheung,Hua Huang,Xiuyuan Chen,Cong Nie,Wenting Zhong,Guiqiang Jiang,Yuxin Wei,Jacob Hong Man Yu,Si Chen,Xiaowen Ou,Teng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning AIS assessment framework that predicts both superior and inferior endplate angles with vertebral midpoint coordinates, using an HRNet backbone fused with Swin-Transformer modules and SVD-based angle extraction. Introduces Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI). On 630 AP radiographs, achieves 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error, with good generalization to out-of-distribution cases and prognostic relevance for progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIS assessment suffers from significant observer variability in Cobb angle measurements. There is a need for automated, anatomically faithful analysis that can handle diverse curve patterns without relying on predefined scoliosis models.

Method: A hybrid deep learning framework: HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints to extract vertebral features. SVD is used to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions. Output includes superior/inferior endplate angles and vertebral midpoint coordinates per vertebra, plus a novel Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI). Dataset of 630 full-spine AP radiographs from patients aged 10–18 with rigorous dual-rater annotations. Evaluation includes diagnostic accuracy, mean absolute error of angle predictions, and longitudinal analysis of VWI versus progression.

Result: The model achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55-degree MAE. It generalizes well to out-of-distribution cases. VWI shows significant prognostic correlation with curve progression, whereas Cobb angles did not.

Conclusion: The framework enables early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring. VWI provides a robust, anatomically grounded metric of vertebral deformation with prognostic value, supporting improved clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Surgery enables sub-quadratic attention in pretrained video diffusion models via a hybrid softmax-linear mechanism and distillation, reducing FLOPs by up to 40% while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of self-attention in transformer-based VDMs hinders long sequences/high resolutions; linear attention reduces cost but often sacrifices expressiveness and requires retraining. There is a need to adapt pretrained models efficiently without full retraining.

Method: Introduce a novel hybrid attention mechanism that mixes softmax and linear tokens (Attention Surgery), plus a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline that requires only a few GPU-days. Includes a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B DiT-based VDM.

Result: Achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models: up to 40% reduction in attention FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality on standard benchmarks VBench and VBench-2.0.

Conclusion: Efficiently converts pretrained VDMs to sub-quadratic attention without full retraining, enabling scalable video generation with preserved quality; the approach can generalize to other pretrained diffusion models.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large, hierarchically structured, automatically generated dataset (80k instruction-image pairs) for unified multimodal models, spanning 11 domains and 51 subtasks, enabling notable gains when fine-tuned: up to 18% on editing and 13% on generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data bottleneck in unified multimodal models by providing a systematic, scalable, and domain-rich dataset that covers challenging real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical task taxonomy and an automated data-generation pipeline that leverages structured resource pools and GPT-4o to create 80k instruction-image pairs across 11 domains and 51 subtasks with controlled diversity.

Result: Fine-tuning leading models on the dataset yields significant performance gains: up to 18% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic, structured data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities, enabling better performance on complex editing and generation tasks across diverse domains.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SID is an iterative self-improving demonstrations framework for goal-oriented, language-guided navigation that bootstraps from shortest-path data and progressively learns more exploratory trajectories, achieving SOTA on REVERIE and SOON (e.g., 50.9% SR on SOON unseen).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exploration bottleneck in language-guided navigation by moving beyond fixed short-path demos and enabling self-generated demonstrations to drive exploration and generalization, with cross-task transfer.

Method: Train an initial agent on shortest-path trajectories sampled from environments. Use this agent to generate novel exploration rollouts. Convert rollouts into demonstrations to train a better agent. Repeat iteratively, enabling demonstrations to transfer across language-guided tasks and new environments.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements in exploration and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation benchmarks, including 50.9% success rate on unseen SOON validation splits (surpassing prior approaches by 13.9%).

Conclusion: Self-improving demonstrations offer a scalable pathway to generalization across environments and tasks, elevating the performance ceiling for language-guided navigation.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

TL;DR: Seg-CFT: a segmentation-guided counterfactual fine-tuning framework that enables structure-specific edits in images without pixel-wise labels, yielding realistic chest radiographs and promising coronary artery disease modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual methods rely on external classifiers/regressors and pixel-level label maps for structure-specific changes, which can cause global artifacts and are tedious to obtain.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) preserves scalar, structure-specific variables while using segmentation guidance to produce locally coherent, realistic counterfactuals; avoids requiring full segmentation maps.

Result: Demonstrates generation of realistic chest radiographs and offers promising results for modeling coronary artery disease; code available.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT enables simple, effective structure-specific counterfactuals with locally coherent outputs, improving practicality for medical imaging data augmentation and debiasing.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

### [316] [Scalable GANs with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24935)
*Sangeek Hyun,MinKyu Lee,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work studies scalable GANs by training in a compact latent space and using purely transformer-based generators and discriminators; it identifies scale-related failure modes and offers lightweight, scale-friendly remedies, achieving state-of-the-art fast class-conditional image synthesis on ImageNet-256 with GAT-XL/2 in 40 epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock scalable, efficient GAN training by leveraging latent-space representations and transformer architectures, and to address failure modes that emerge when scaling GANs.

Method: Train GANs in a latent (VAE) space and use fully transformer-based generator and discriminator. Analyze failure modes (early-layer underutilization and optimization instability) during scaling and propose lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustments. Evaluate across model sizes from S through XL, culminating in GAT and GAT-XL/2 on ImageNet-256.

Result: GAT (latent-space, transformer-based GAN) trains reliably across various capacities (S–XL). GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 in 40 epochs, six times fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Conclusion: Latent-space, transformer-based GANs with simple, scale-friendly interventions enable scalable, high-quality generative modeling. The approach achieves efficient, competitive results and demonstrates how to mitigate scaling-induced instability and underutilization.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

*Jiahua Li,Kun Wei,Zhe Xu,Zibo Su,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogniGPT introduces an interactive MGPA-VERA loop for long video understanding, achieving high accuracy with minimal frames and improved efficiency, outperforming training-free baselines and approaching strong training-based models on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos contain temporally complex and sparse task-relevant information, making complete and efficient reasoning difficult for AI systems. Existing LLM-based approaches struggle to capture all critical cues without excessive computation or hallucinations.

Method: Propose CogniGPT, comprising a Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) that mimics human divergent/focused attention to collect task-relevant cues, and a Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) that verifies key clues to mitigate hallucinations and refine perception strategies. These two agents engage in an interactive loop to iteratively identify a minimal, informative set of reliable clues for the task.

Result: Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat show superior accuracy and efficiency. On EgoSchema, CogniGPT surpasses existing training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Conclusion: An interactive MGPA-VERA framework enables efficient, reliable long-video understanding by focusing on a small set of reliable task-related cues, reducing data requirements and improving robustness against hallucination.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

*Ankur Chanda,Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temperature Scaling markedly improves calibration (ECE and NLL) for a CNN brain tumor classifier under multiple noise types, without hurting accuracy, making medical AI outputs more reliable in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes medical decisions require reliable confidence estimates. Deep networks often miscalibrate under noise; TS offers a simple, post-hoc way to improve calibration.

Method: Train a custom CNN on a merged brain MRI dataset and introduce five noise types (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, Uniform) to simulate uncertainty. Evaluate metrics (precision, recall, F1, accuracy, NLL, ECE) before and after applying Temperature Scaling as a post-hoc calibration step.

Result: TS significantly reduces both ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective, computationally efficient method to enhance the reliability of medical AI systems in noisy or uncertain environments.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

*Ermanno Bartoli,Dennis Rotondi,Buwei He,Patric Jensfelt,Kai O. Arras,Iolanda Leite*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends 3D Scene Graphs with human-centric social semantics and long-range open-vocabulary reasoning; introduces Social 3D Scene Graphs and a synthetic benchmark; shows improvements in human activity prediction and human–environment reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graphs largely ignore humans and human–environment relationships, and typically rely on single-image open-vocabulary relations. This limits modeling of long-range interactions and socially aware robotics. A human-inclusive, open-vocabulary 3D representation is needed for socially intelligent agents.

Method: Introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs (S3DG): augment 3D scene graphs with humans, their attributes, activities, and relationships (including remote ones) in an open-vocabulary framework. Build a synthetic environment benchmark with comprehensive human–scene relationship annotations and diverse query types to evaluate social scene understanding in 3D.

Result: Experiments show improved human activity prediction and better reasoning about human–environment relations. The synthetic benchmark enables evaluation of long-range interactions and open-vocabulary reasoning in 3D scenes, supporting more socially intelligent robot behavior.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs advance socially aware robotics by incorporating human-centric relations and open-vocabulary reasoning in 3D, backed by a synthetic benchmark for robust evaluation; future work could extend to real-world data and broader social queries.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

### [320] [Event-based Facial Keypoint Alignment via Cross-Modal Fusion Attention and Self-Supervised Multi-Event Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24968)
*Donghwa Kang,Junho Kim,Dongwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised learning framework improves event-based facial keypoint alignment by leveraging RGB guidance and unlabeled event data, achieving state-of-the-art results on real and synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and robustness to illumination but suffer from limited spatial information; existing RGB-keypoint methods underperform on event data, and labeled event datasets are scarce, hindering progress.

Method: Introduce cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) to fuse corresponding RGB data with event inputs, guiding robust feature extraction. Implement self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) on unlabeled event data to enhance representation without labels. Evaluate on real-event E-SIE and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance gains.

Result: The proposed framework consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics on both real and synthetic datasets, showing notable improvements in facial keypoint alignment accuracy.

Conclusion: CMFA plus SSMER effectively addresses modality gaps and data scarcity, enabling robust event-based facial keypoint alignment and strong cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: On-the-fly GliGAN-based data augmentation for robust cross-treatment glioma segmentation; ensemble nnU-Net models achieve state-of-the-art results on BraTS 2025 Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited diverse annotated data to generalize tumor segmentation across pre- and post-treatment MRI; storage burden of large augmented 3D datasets motivates dynamic augmentation.

Method: Dynamic insertion of synthetic tumors during training using pretrained GliGANs within nnU-Net framework; compare baseline, regular on-the-fly augmentation, and customized on-the-fly augmentation; ensemble of three models; leveraging GliGAN weights and tumor insertion from prior winning solutions.

Result: Ensemble achieves lesion-wise Dice: ET 0.79, NETC 0.749, RC 0.872, SNFH 0.825, TC 0.79, WT 0.88 on BraTS 2025 validation; ranked first in BraTS Lighthouse Challenge Task 1 (Adult Glioma Segmentation).

Conclusion: Dynamic, on-the-fly GliGAN-based augmentation effectively improves generalization to treatment-induced appearance variations, delivering competitive state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This
work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma

*Haotian Dong,Wenjing Wang,Chen Li,Di Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wan-Alpha: a joint RGB+alpha video generation framework that uses a VAE to encode alpha into the RGB latent space and trains a diffusion transformer on a high-quality RGBA video dataset, achieving superior visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering, including semi-transparent effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGBA video generation is increasingly needed across applications, but existing methods often neglect visual quality and fail to model transparency jointly; there is a need for a unified RGB–alpha modeling approach and high-quality training data.

Method: A variational autoencoder encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. A diffusion transformer is trained on a new, high-quality RGBA video dataset to support joint RGB–alpha generation.

Result: Wan-Alpha achieves superior visual quality, more realistic motion, and more accurate transparency rendering than state-of-the-art methods; it can render diverse semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine details (e.g., hair strands). The model and dataset are released on the project website.

Conclusion: Joint RGB–alpha learning via a VAE and a diffusion transformer, combined with a dedicated RGBA video dataset, yields high-quality transparent video generation, representing a meaningful advancement in the field and enabling broader semi-transparent content generation.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

### [323] [SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980)
*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose is a diffusion-prior fine-tuning framework that directly predicts human keypoint heatmaps in Stable Diffusion latent space using a lightweight pose head, with an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch; it achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain pose estimation with less training and enables zero-shot pose annotation for controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained diffusion models offer rich multi-scale latent features and cross-domain generalization. However, structured outputs like human pose haven't been fully exploited. There is a need to leverage priors for robust pose estimation and domain transfer, while maintaining training efficiency.

Method: Direct latent-space heatmap prediction for keypoints from the SD U-Net features; map latent features to heatmaps via a small convolutional pose head; do not modify cross-attention modules or learnable embeddings; add an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch to preserve generative semantics and improve generalization; evaluate on COCO and a style-transferred COCO (COCO-OOD) for domain shift robustness; demonstrate zero-shot pose annotation for downstream controllable generation.

Result: SDPose achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO val with only one-fifth of Sapiens' training schedule; attains state-of-the-art on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD; serves as a high-quality zero-shot pose annotator for ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, providing superior pose guidance qualitatively.

Conclusion: SDPose demonstrates that pre-trained diffusion priors can be effectively repurposed for structured outputs like human pose, delivering strong cross-domain robustness and training efficiency, and enabling useful zero-shot pose guidance for generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

*Yuyang Yin,HaoXiang Guo,Fangfu Liu,Mengyu Wang,Hanwen Liang,Eric Li,Yikai Wang,Xiaojie Jin,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X introduces a high-fidelity, controllable panoramic video generator that uses a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer and a large Unreal Engine–generated dataset to enable diverse camera trajectories, achieving improved motion range, control precision, and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 360-degree video generation is hindered by narrow field-of-view and limited camera controllability, making it hard to synthesize continuous, holistic scenes. A geometry-aware model that respects spherical data can improve fidelity and temporal continuity.

Method: 1) Build a large-scale dataset of panoramic video–exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments using Unreal Engine. 2) Develop a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to capture geometric adjacency in latent space. 3) Train and evaluate the model on diverse camera trajectories to assess motion range, control precision, and visual quality.

Result: PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance across motion range, control precision, and visual quality, with enhanced spatiotemporal continuity due to geometry-aware latent space modeling.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications in immersive panoramic video generation and exploration, addressing spherical geometry misalignment and enabling controllable, high-fidelity panoramic content.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Local View Transformer (LVT) is proposed to scale 3D vision and novel view synthesis by using local, neighborhood attention instead of quadratic global attention, decoding into a 3D Gaussian Splat representation for view-dependent color/opacity, enabling large, high-resolution scene reconstruction in one forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic attention complexity, hindering scaling to large scenes in 3D vision. The insight that nearby views carry more useful local signal motivates a locality-biased architecture.

Method: Process information in a local neighborhood around each view using attention over nearby tokens. Introduce a novel positional encoding conditioned on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. Decode outputs into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation with view-dependent color and opacity. Enables large-scale, high-resolution reconstructions in a single forward pass.

Result: The approach enables reconstruction and novel view synthesis for arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass. The abstract emphasizes qualitative results and references a project page with results and interactive demos rather than providing quantitative metrics in the text.

Conclusion: Local View Transformer offers a scalable alternative to standard Transformers for 3D vision by restricting attention to local neighborhoods with pose-conditioned encoding, achieving scalable, high-resolution scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

TL;DR: Training-free unsupervised image segmentation (CLASP) using DINO features, affinity-based spectral clustering with automatic cluster count via eigengap silhouette, and DenseCRF refinement, achieving competitive results on COCO Stuff and ADE20K; a strong reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a lightweight unsupervised segmentation method that does not rely on labeled data or fine-tuning, enabling practical use in large unannotated corpora (e.g., advertising, content moderation).

Method: Extract per-patch features with a self-supervised ViT encoder (DINO); build an affinity matrix; perform spectral clustering; automatically determine segment count with an eigengap silhouette search; sharpen boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF.

Result: Attains competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines; zero-training design enhances reproducibility and practicality.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a simple, training-free framework for unsupervised segmentation that is competitive with supervised baselines in some cases, offering a robust, reproducible baseline suitable for large unannotated datasets and practical workflows.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

TL;DR: Post-training, task-aware reinforcement learning with tailored rewards to adapt reasoning-based models to Earth Observation tasks, achieving consistent gains across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation tasks have unique challenges (e.g., referred object detection, captioning, change detection, grounding, temporal analysis) that demand task-aware reasoning; standard RL/VLM methods may underperform due to domain-specific requirements and stability issues.

Method: Introduce a post-training framework that injects task-aware rewards into reasoning-based RL models to adapt them to diverse EO tasks (detection, captioning, change detection, grounding, temporal analysis), improving stability and robustness.

Result: Consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art generic and specialized vision-language models across multiple EO benchmarks, with enhanced robustness and more stable optimization.

Conclusion: Task-aware reward-driven RL adaptation is effective for EO reasoning tasks, enabling better generalization and robustness; code and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

### [328] [STAGE: Stable and Generalizable GRPO for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25027)
*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable GRPO framework for autoregressive image generation that uses (1) similarity-aware Advantage/KL reweighting to reduce conflicting token updates, and (2) an entropy-based reward relative to a reference model to stabilize training. It improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared with baseline GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying reinforcement learning with GRPO to autoregressive (AR) image models is unstable and often disrupts pretrained capabilities, due to contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. A robust, generalizable solution is needed to maintain pretrained performance while gaining sample efficiency and generalization.

Method: STAGE introduces two components: (1) Advantage/KL reweighting with similarity-aware weighting to alleviate conflicting updates from tokens; (2) An entropy reward that aligns the learned policy's entropy with that of a reference model to stabilize learning and reduce reward hacking.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, training stability, and cross-task generalization over baseline GRPO approaches.

Conclusion: By mitigating token-level gradient conflicts and stabilizing entropy dynamics, STAGE reduces perturbations to pretrained distributions and enhances generalization, with strong transfer to other benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [329] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL: a cross-modal framework that uses LLM-conditioned prompts and synthetic data to ground few-shot learning, with a geometry-based cross-modal alignment that fuses textual, support, and synthetic visuals; achieves state-of-the-art on ten benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses semantic hallucination and noisy guidance in few-shot learning due to reliance on limited support data. Seeks stronger grounding by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-modal synthesis, plus a geometry-aware alignment to ensure coherent multimodal integration.

Method: Two components: 1) Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP): condition an LLM on class names and support images to generate precise, structured class descriptions in a single reasoning pass; these descriptions enable zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images and provide high-level semantics for textual prompts. 2) Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA): align the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3D parallelotope spanned by them, capturing global nonlinear relationships and enabling integrated multimodal representations.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios; code released at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: VT-FSL demonstrates effective grounding of novel-class semantics via LLM-guided prompts and a geometry-aware fusion mechanism, using complementary textual and synthetic visual prompts to compensate for limited support data and robustly unify multimodal information for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

### [330] [Fast Real-Time Pipeline for Robust Arm Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25042)
*Milán Zsolt Bagladi,László Gulyás,Gergő Szalay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time dynamic arm gesture recognition pipeline that uses OpenPose keypoints, 1x1 normalization, and an RNN classifier, with coordinate- and angle-based features and rotation-based data augmentation to improve robustness to camera angle variations; includes an optional arm-speed estimation component.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, real-time recognition of dynamic arm gestures across varying camera angles by leveraging robust pose estimation and normalization, while reducing annotation burden and improving generalization through augmentation.

Method: Pipeline stages: (1) OpenPose-based keypoint estimation, (2) keypoint normalization using a 1x1 scheme, (3) extraction of two feature representations (coordinate-based and angle-based), (4) recurrent neural network classifier for sequence modeling. Robustness to camera angle is enhanced by artificially rotating training data. An optional module computes the speed of the arm signal when needed.

Result: Evaluations on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset show high accuracy across different viewing angles and arm speeds, indicating strong robustness and real-time capability.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively enables real-time dynamic arm gesture recognition with robust performance under viewpoint and speed variations; rotation-based data augmentation is beneficial, and a speed estimation component provides additional utility when required.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time pipeline for dynamic arm gesture recognition
based on OpenPose keypoint estimation, keypoint normalization, and a recurrent
neural network classifier. The 1 x 1 normalization scheme and two feature
representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline.
In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.
Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high
accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to
calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

*Rohit Jena,Vedant Zope,Pratik Chaudhari,James C. Gee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FFDP introduces IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels plus a distributed framework to accelerate large-scale image registration, enabling multimodal, high-resolution registration on modest GPU clusters with significant speedups and memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration is fundamental in biomedical imaging but scales poorly with data size; current model-parallelism ideas from large-scale transformer training don't address non-GEMM bottlenecks and tensor sharding for convolution-heavy workloads.

Method: Develop FFDP: IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels that optimize IO and convolution, plus a distributed framework enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding; complements existing model parallelism; demonstrated on ex-vivo brain MRI at native resolution.

Result: Registrations at 100 micron ex-vivo brain MRI at native resolution on 8 A6000 GPUs in about one minute; speedups of 6–7x over SOTA pipelines; memory usage reduced by 20–59%; on 250 micron data, FFDP can fit up to 64x larger problems than current SOTA on a single GPU; shows both performance and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: FFDP substantially improves scalability and efficiency of image registration workflows, enabling unprecedented large-scale multimodal registrations; indicates practical impact for biomedical imaging; further work may address generalization to broader hardware/datasets and real-world deployment.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

### [332] [GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25075)
*Huaizhi Qu,Xiao Wang,Gengwei Zhang,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM introduces a real-space cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian splatting, representing proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (11 parameters each) and a novel voxel-wise gradient, achieving faster training, lower memory, and improved local resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable, high-fidelity 3D reconstructions are needed for large cryo-EM datasets; Fourier-space methods are fast but limited in fidelity, while NeRF-like real-space methods are accurate but memory-intensive.

Method: Model density with a set of 3D Gaussians (11 parameters per Gaussian). Employ a novel gradient computation for voxel-contributions to accelerate training, and operate directly in real space via 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS).

Result: Benchmarking shows GEM: up to 48% faster training, ~12% lower memory usage, and up to 38.8% improvement in local resolution over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GEM offers a practical, scalable cryo-EM reconstruction framework that balances speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE: RL-optimized depth-to-image generation creates over 20M realistic RGB images each paired with ground-truth depth; training with hybrid supervision (pseudo-labels + GT) yields state-of-the-art, robust monocular depth estimation with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity and quality limits in monocular depth estimation by leveraging large-scale, diverse synthetic data and robust supervision.

Method: RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation to synthesize >20M RGB-depth pairs from diverse source depth maps; train depth estimation model using hybrid supervision combining teacher pseudo-labels and ground-truth depth.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and in capturing complex scene details; demonstrates improved scale and domain diversity leading to more robust depth features.

Conclusion: BRIDGE offers a scalable data-generation and training paradigm for robust monocular depth estimation; code and models are provided online.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

### [334] [UniLat3D: Geometry-Appearance Unified Latents for Single-Stage 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25079)
*Guanjun Wu,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Sikuang Li,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Zanwei Zhou,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D introduces UniLat, a unified geometry-appearance latent space via a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, enabling single-stage 3D asset generation from a single image using a flow-matching model; outputs 3D Gaussians or meshes; fast and high-quality, trained on public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation pipelines are diffusion-based and per-geometry staged (first geometry, then appearance). This decoupled design leads to geometry-texture misalignment, increased cost, and slower generation. A unified latent approach aims to align geometry and appearance in one stage for faster, higher-quality results.

Method: Propose a geometry-appearance Unified VAE (UniLat) to compress high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent (UniLat) that fuses structure and texture into a dense low-res latent. Decode UniLat into multiple 3D formats (e.g., 3D Gaussians, meshes). Train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly to UniLat, enabling one-shot generation from noise. Trained solely on public datasets and capable of generating from a single image.

Result: UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, with superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. The approach outputs diverse formats (Gaussians, meshes) and provides demos and code on the project site.

Conclusion: A unified geometry-appearance latent enables efficient single-stage 3D asset generation, addressing geometry-texture misalignment and cost of multi-stage pipelines. By learning a compact UniLat with a single flow-matching model, UniLat3D achieves fast, high-fidelity 3D content from minimal input, with broad applicability across formats.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

### [335] [MANI-Pure: Magnitude-Adaptive Noise Injection for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25082)
*Xiaoyi Huang,Junwei Wu,Kejia Zhang,Carl Yang,Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a magnitude-adaptive purification framework for diffusion-model defenses against adversarial attacks. It uses the input's magnitude spectrum to apply frequency-targeted, heterogeneous noise, suppressing high-frequency, low-magnitude perturbations while preserving low-frequency semantic content, improving robustness with minimal loss in clean accuracy, achieving SOTA results on RobustBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification with diffusion models often injects uniform noise that distorts semantic structure and harms robustness. Empirical evidence shows adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with varying magnitudes across frequencies and attack types, motivating a frequency-aware purification strategy.

Method: Introduce MANI-Pure, which leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide purification. Rather than uniform noise, it applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, suppressing perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically important low-frequency content during diffusion-based purification.

Result: The method, evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, closes the clean-accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: A frequency-aware, magnitude-guided purification framework effectively mitigates adversarial perturbations with limited impact on clean accuracy, setting new SOTA performance and highlighting the importance of matching purification noise patterns to the perturbation spectrum.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Directly optimize triangle meshes in a differentiable splatting framework (Triangle Splatting+) to enable real-time, mesh-based novel-view synthesis with state-of-the-art fidelity and ready-to-use outputs for graphics engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers fast rendering but relies on primitive Gaussians not native to mesh-based pipelines; existing conversions add complexity and degrade quality. There is a need for an end-to-end mesh-native, differentiable approach that yields production-ready geometry.

Method: Introduce triangle parametrization with shared vertices to ensure mesh connectivity; develop training strategy to enforce triangle opacity; integrate into a differentiable splatting pipeline; produce semi-connected meshes that require no post-processing for graphics engines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mesh-based neural view synthesis on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples; surpasses prior splatting methods in visual fidelity; efficient training; outputs usable in standard graphics engines; supports downstream tasks like physics simulation and interactive walkthroughs.

Conclusion: Triangle Splatting+ provides a mesh-native, differentiable rendering framework that delivers high-fidelity, fast-training, production-ready geometry for mesh-based NVS and related applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

### [337] [Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25127)
*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unifies diffusion and flow matching via a Bayes-based derivation, extends score distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models with DiT backbones, and shows SiD works broadly across data-free and data-aided settings with minimal adjustments and no teacher finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether distillation techniques like score distillation transfer to flow-matching models, given their theoretical equivalence to Gaussian diffusion, and to accelerate text-to-image generation.

Method: Provide a Bayes-rule/conditional-expectation derivation unifying Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations; extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models (e.g., SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, FLUX.1-dev) using DiT backbones; evaluate in data-free and data-aided settings with modest adjustments and without teacher finetuning or architectural changes.

Result: SiD applies out of the box across multiple flow-matching models with only modest adjustments; demonstrates stability and soundness; provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation transfers to text-to-image flow matching models; unifies acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators; PyTorch implementation will be released.

Conclusion: Score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow-matching models, resolving concerns about stability and soundness and enabling cross-framework acceleration; the work lays groundwork for public PyTorch code to facilitate adoption.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

### [338] [TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143)
*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench introduces a temporal medical image reasoning benchmark for LVLMs, featuring 3 tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and a 17k-strong knowledge corpus, evaluated across 12 models. Findings show most LVLMs struggle with longitudinal patient-condition analysis; only a few large models show moderate ability. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation provides notable gains, especially for VQA (avg ~2.6%); the work highlights the need for temporal reasoning in medical AI and a promising retrieval-based direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between existing single-visit medical reasoning benchmarks and real-world clinical practice where physicians track changes over time; assess how LVLMs reason about temporal medical images and what techniques can enhance performance.

Method: Construct TemMed-Bench with a test set of three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) plus a supplementary knowledge corpus (~17,000 instances). Evaluate 12 LVLMs (6 proprietary, 6 open-source) and analyze the impact of multi-modal retrieval augmentation (visual + textual) vs text-only or no retrieval across tasks; report per-model performance and overall trends.

Result: Most LVLMs perform near random in temporal medical image reasoning; a few models (GPT-3, GPT-4-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) show comparatively better performance but not state-of-the-art. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields higher gains than other setups, with VQA showing an average improvement of 2.59%.

Conclusion: TemMed-Bench reveals significant gaps in temporal medical image reasoning for LVLMs and demonstrates that multi-modal retrieval augmentation can substantially boost performance. The benchmark provides a realistic evaluation grounded in longitudinal clinical practice and points to retrieval-based strategies as a promising direction for future work.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

### [339] [VideoAnchor: Reinforcing Subspace-Structured Visual Cues for Coherent Visual-Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25151)
*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play VideoAnchor module reinforces cross-frame visual cues in multimodal LLMs by linking Transformer attention with sparse subspace clustering to anchor attention on shared visual structures, improving visual-spatial reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In vision-language models, visual tokens are often overwhelmed by language tokens, causing inconsistent recognition of the same visual cues across frames and hindering visual-spatial reasoning.

Method: Introduce VideoAnchor, a plug-in module that uses subspace affinity (inspired by self-expressiveness in sparse subspace clustering) to reinforce visual cues across frames, guiding Transformer attention to consistent visual structures without retraining.

Result: Consistent improvements on vision-spatial benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench and Video-MME) across backbones (InternVL2-8B, Qwen2.5VL-72B); reported gains of 3.2% and 4.6% respectively; qualitative analyses show more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding; code to be released.

Conclusion: Bringing subspace clustering intuition into Transformer attention yields robust cross-frame visual grounding and spatial reasoning improvements in MLLMs without retraining, validating the proposed VideoAnchor as a versatile plug-in.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V introduces a purely visual, multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark derived from GSM8K, with 1,319 samples; reveals large performance gaps for VLMs between text and visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing benchmarks (geometric focus, math word problems, multi-image reasoning) and to probe the true visual mathematical reasoning capability of VLMs.

Method: Automated image-generation pipeline plus meticulous human annotation to convert GSM8K samples into high-quality visual prompts; curates 1,319 samples; evaluates a wide range of open- and closed-source models on GSM8K-V.

Result: Current VLMs show substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V despite near-saturation on text GSM8K (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro: 95.22% on GSM8K vs 46.93% on GSM8K-V).

Conclusion: GSM8K-V offers a new benchmark to study visual mathematical reasoning and guides development of more robust, generalizable VLMs.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing enables real-time, long-horizon streaming video with much less error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract targets streaming long videos for interactive world models and neural game engines, highlighting severe error accumulation in existing methods that degrade long-horizon video quality and hinder real-time streaming.

Method: Three innovations: (1) joint denoising of multiple frames with progressively increasing noise to relax strict frame-to-frame causality; (2) attention sink mechanism to store initial frames' key-value states as a global context anchor for long-term consistency; (3) an efficient training algorithm enabling few-step distillation over extended, non-overlapping denoising windows to mitigate exposure bias from self-generated histories.

Result: Extensive experiments show real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing provides a practical, scalable approach for long-horizon streaming video generation, achieving real-time performance while maintaining long-term coherence and reducing error growth.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

### [342] [Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25162)
*Bowei Chen,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,He Zhang,Tianyuan Zhang,Zhengqi Li,Yuanjun Xiong,Jianming Zhang,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Align pretrained visual encoders as semantic tokenizers for latent diffusion, enabling faster diffusion training and stronger generation with a three-stage alignment process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage rich semantic structure of foundation encoders to create semantically grounded tokenizers, avoiding VAE-from-scratch and speeding up diffusion model convergence.

Method: Three-stage alignment: (1) freeze encoder; train an adapter and a decoder to form a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with a semantic preservation loss to keep perceptual details and high-level semantics; (3) refine the decoder for better reconstruction; then use the tokenizer with diffusion models and evaluate on ImageNet-256 and LAION-2B, comparing to FLUX VAE.

Result: Obtains semantically rich image tokenizers that accelerate diffusion, achieving gFID 1.90 in 64 epochs on ImageNet-256; improved generation with/without classifier-free guidance; on LAION (2B-param T2I), the model trained with this tokenizer outperforms FLUX VAE given the same training steps.

Conclusion: Simple, scalable, and semantically grounded approach to continuous tokenizer design for latent diffusion models, offering faster convergence and better performance at scale.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

### [344] [Personalized Vision via Visual In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25172)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO enables open-ended vision personalization without retraining by learning a transformation from a single exemplar and applying it to new inputs via diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners; it is supported by a diverse tuning dataset (VisRel) and an attention-guided seed scorer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data and are restricted to fixed tasks. There is a need for flexible, test-time customization that generalizes to new, user-defined objectives across recognition and generation.

Method: A four-panel framework (PICO) that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners. From a single annotated exemplar, it infers the underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. It is supported by VisRel, a diverse tuning dataset, and an attention-guided seed scorer to improve inference efficiency and reliability.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation, demonstrating robust open-ended personalization.

Conclusion: Task diversity drives generalization more than scale; diffusion-based visual ICL can enable flexible, retrain-free personalization across a range of vision tasks when equipped with appropriate tuning data and efficient inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

### [345] [Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple layer-contrastive decoding method (LayerCD) reduces hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by contrasting outputs from shallow vs deep vision features; achieves significant improvements on two hallucination benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs arise from reliance on biased, low-level shallow visual features that are insufficient for high-level reasoning; need a decoding strategy to filter these signals.

Method: LayerCD contrasts the output distributions produced using visual features from different layers (shallow vs deep) of the vision encoder to filter out hallucinations.

Result: LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art on two hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating effective reduction of hallucinations.

Conclusion: A simple, effective decoding approach that leverages layer-wise visual features can improve factual grounding in MLLMs, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is an automatic stress-testing method for multimodal LLMs that generates natural-looking images with subtle cues to induce hallucinations, revealing vulnerability and guiding mitigation via fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to systematically uncover model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities in MLLMs beyond static benchmarks.

Method: optimize in image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent; then condition a diffusion model to generate natural-looking images; evaluate across models, including transferable vulnerabilities, and test fine-tuning as mitigation.

Result: hallucination success rate >28% across models (vs ~1% in prior methods); images are high-quality and object-free per metrics and human evaluation; transferability: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at 66.5%; fine-tuning on generated images mitigates hallucination.

Conclusion: GHOST serves as a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable MLLMs, reveals transferable vulnerabilities, and suggests fine-tuning as an effective mitigation; underscores need for robust evaluation and safeguards against adversarial image generation.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

### [347] [DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25180)
*Wenkun He,Yuchao Gu,Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Yujun Lin,Zhekai Zhang,Haocheng Xi,Muyang Li,Ligeng Zhu,Jincheng Yu,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Gen accelerates text-to-image diffusion by operating in a deeply compressed latent space, bridging the representation gap with lightweight embedding alignment and minimal LoRA fine-tuning. It delivers high-quality 4K generation with substantial speedups (up to 138x latency reduction) on representative models, validated on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome efficiency bottlenecks when scaling diffusion models to high resolutions (e.g., 4K) due to latent-space redundancy, while avoiding full retraining of base models.

Method: Post-training pipeline: compress latent space; align base and compressed latent spaces via lightweight embedding alignment training to close the representation gap; apply small LoRA fine-tuning to recover base-model quality; optionally combine with NVFP4 SVDQuant for further speedups; validated on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea to produce DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX.

Result: DC-Gen maintains image quality comparable to the base models while delivering large latency reductions: DC-Gen-FLUX reduces 4K image generation latency by 53x on NVIDIA H100; with NVFP4 SVDQuant, 4K image generation in 3.5 seconds on a single RTX 5090, achieving ~138x total latency reduction vs the base FLUX.1-Krea.

Conclusion: A viable post-training approach to accelerate high-resolution diffusion generation by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space, bridging representation gaps with embedding alignment, and using minimal LoRA fine-tuning, with strong speedups and maintained quality.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Result: Up to 14.8x lower inference latency than base models; enables 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU; maintains reconstruction quality; generalizes to longer videos; adaptation cost around 10 GPU-days.

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen enables practical, efficient video generation from pre-trained diffusion models by post-training adaptation to a deep compression latent space, delivering substantial latency reductions and high-resolution capability with modest training effort; code available.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video

latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD3R reconstructs deformable 3D objects from casual monocular videos by learning a personalized, object-centric pose estimator supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model, and optimizing a deformable 3D Gaussian representation with long-term 2D tracking and differentiable rendering, yielding robust, category-agnostic, high-fidelity reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long videos, large deformations, camera motion, and scarce views, limiting reliable 3D reconstruction from unposed footage.

Method: Train a personalized object-centric pose estimator guided by a pre-trained image-to-3D model; optimize a deformable 3D Gaussian representation; regularize with long-term 2D point tracking; leverage differentiable rendering and generative priors to produce articulated 3D reconstructions.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative results show robustness and generalization across challenging scenarios, delivering high-fidelity, articulated, category-agnostic 3D reconstructions suitable for dynamic scene understanding and content creation.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates strong robustness and generalization for dynamic 3D reconstruction from casual video, highlighting potential for broader dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

*Shuoshuo Zhang,Zijian Li,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Jun Zhang,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft introduces a multi-agent framework for high-fidelity visual processing and flexible, memory-enabled reasoning on structured images, achieving strong gains over cue-based methods on chart and geometry tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured images pose perceptual slips for multimodal LLMs; cue-based methods suffer from low-fidelity image processing and rigid, linear reasoning, limiting performance on complex structured-image tasks.

Method: A multi-agent system (dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, visual tool agents) plus a high-quality corpus and grounding-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization; integration with traditional CV algorithms in tool agents; a three-stage workflow (tool selection, agent discussion, self-criticism); an image memory to revisit steps, explore branches, and dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory.

Result: Empirical evaluation on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks shows PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning for advanced MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning; code will be available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: PixelCraft enables high-fidelity processing and flexible, memory-enabled visual reasoning for structured images, improving MLLM performance and reliability on structured-image tasks.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

### [351] [FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187)
*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V prevents conditional image leakage in I2V by latent shifting and Fourier-guided high-frequency guidance, improving generalization—achieving strong out-of-domain performance with a compact 1.3B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional image leakage in I2V causes color inconsistencies, slow motion, and poor out-of-domain generalization; reducing leakage can improve robustness and performance across data domains.

Method: 1) Latent Shifting: subtract conditional image information from noisy latents to implicitly condition the generation; 2) Fourier Guidance: use high-frequency magnitude features from Fourier transform to accelerate convergence and control detail levels.

Result: Overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves best generalization/out-of-domain performance among I2V methods; 1.3B parameter FlashI2V attains a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, outperforming larger models CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

Conclusion: FlashI2V offers an effective and parameter-efficient solution to conditional image leakage, with explicit mechanisms to modulate detail and ensure robust out-of-domain performance.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [352] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, vision-centric post-training framework (Visual Jigsaw) for multimodal LLMs that uses a permutation reconstruction task across images, videos, and 3D data, optimized via RLVR, without extra visual generators or annotations, improving perception and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift post-training from text-centric approaches that rely on dense visual cues and text as mediator toward a vision-centric objective that directly enhances visual understanding in multimodal LLMs, enabling better fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding without annotations.

Method: Partition and shuffle visual inputs (images, videos, 3D data) and require the model to reconstruct the original arrangement by producing the correct permutation in natural language. This aligns with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), uses no additional visual generative components, and relies on self-supervision with no annotations.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across multiple visual modalities.

Conclusion: Vision-centric pretext tasks like Visual Jigsaw can effectively strengthen visual understanding in multimodal LLMs, reduce dependence on text as an intermediary, and inspire further research into vision-centric post-training paradigms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

### [353] [VGGT-X: When VGGT Meets Dense Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25191)
*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-efficient VGGT-X enables dense NVS with 3D foundation models by scaling to 1,000+ images, improving alignment, and robust 3DGS training; closes fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines and achieves state-of-the-art dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D foundation models struggle to scale to dense view synthesis due to enormous VRAM requirements and initialization-sensitive outputs; COLMAP/SfM pipelines remain the reliable baseline but are slow or fragile in low-texture/low-overlap captures. There is a need for COLMAP-free dense NVS and robust training practices for 3D generative models.

Method: Propose VGGT-X: a memory-efficient VGGT (Volumetric Generalized Global Transformer) implementation that scales to 1,000+ images; introduce adaptive global alignment to refine VGGT outputs for improved 3DGS training; adopt robust 3DGS training practices tailored for dense data.

Result: Experiments show a substantial reduction of the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation; provide analysis of remaining gaps when using COLMAP-initialized rendering.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of dense NVS using 3D foundation models without COLMAP, and offers a concrete pathway (VGGT-X) to close the gap and guide future 3D foundation model development and dense NVS research; project page available.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

### [354] [Multiscale 2-Mapper -- Exploratory Data Analysis Guided by the First Betti Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22816)
*Halley Fritze*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 2-Mapper extends Mapper to reveal 2D features and 1D topology; provides parameter selection tools via persistent Betti-1 and uses Multiscale Mapper to study cover effects; validated on 3D shapes including Klein bottle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapper is a foundational tool in exploratory topological data analysis for connectivity and clustering, but choosing parameters remains problematic and higher-dimensional features are hard to detect. This work proposes 2-Mapper to observe two-dimensional features and one-dimensional topology, with a principled way to select parameters.

Method: Construct 2-Mapper by leveraging higher-dimensional skeleta to capture clustering density. Develop parameter selection guided by persistent Betti-1 information. Analyze cover sensitivity using a computational Multiscale Mapper. Validate on three-dimensional shape data, including the Klein bottle.

Result: Provide tools for selecting 2-Mapper parameters based on persistent Betti-1, and characterize how cover choices affect 2-Mapper outputs through a Multiscale Mapper framework. Empirically demonstrate the approach on 3D shapes, showing the ability to detect nontrivial topology such as the Klein bottle.

Conclusion: 2-Mapper offers a principled extension of Mapper to capture 2D features and 1D topology, with interpretable parameter guidelines and a multiscale analysis method to understand cover effects. The framework is validated on complex shape data, including the Klein bottle.

Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a fundamental tool in exploratory topological data
analysis for identifying connectivity and topological clustering in data.
Derived from the nerve construction, Mapper graphs can contain additional
information about clustering density when considering the higher-dimensional
skeleta. To observe two-dimensional features, and capture one-dimensional
topology, we construct 2-Mapper. A common issue in using Mapper algorithms is
parameter choice. We develop tools to choose 2-Mapper parameters that reflect
persistent Betti-1 information. Computationally, we study how cover choice
affects 2-Mapper and analyze this through a computational Multiscale Mapper
algorithm. We test our constructions on three-dimensional shape data, including
the Klein bottle.

*Sariel Har-Peled,Benjamin Raichel,Eliot W. Robson*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A linear-size directed graph enables (1+ε)-ANN via a greedy walk, with query time O(ε^{-d} log Ψ) and no dependence on data spread.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve near-optimal ANN search with linear-space, avoiding traditional spread-dependent trade-offs and large pre-processing, while keeping the query process simple and practical.

Method: Construct a directed graph G on the n points with O(n/ε^d) edges such that a greedy walk from any query point moves to progressively better points, ultimately yielding a (1+ε)-approximate nearest neighbor. The graph is designed to be independent of the dataset's spread. The walk requires repeatedly moving to a neighbor that is significantly closer to the nearest neighbor, leading to a logarithmic factor in the spread.

Result: Queries can answer (1+ε)-ANN via a greedy walk on G in time O(ε^{-d} log Ψ); graph size is O(n/ε^d). The construction is linear in size and does not depend on the spread, and is claimed to be surprisingly simple and practical.

Conclusion: This work provides a simple, linear-sized, spread-free graph-based approach for (1+ε)-ANN with provable query bounds, suggesting a practical alternative to traditional, spread-dependent ANN structures and opening avenues for further empirical validation and extensions.

Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, and
a parameter $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we present a new construction of a
directed graph $G$, of size $O(n/\varepsilon^d)$, such that
$(1+\varepsilon)$-ANN queries can be answered by performing a greedy walk on
$G$, repeatedly moving to a neighbor that is (significantly) better than the
current point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of
a linear size with no dependency on the spread of the point set. The resulting
query time, is $O( \varepsilon^{-d} \log \Psi)$, where $\Psi$ is the spread of
$P$. The new construction is surprisingly simple and should be practical.

### [356] [Localizing Adversarial Attacks To Produces More Imperceptible Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22710)
*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Localized adversarial attacks using a region-restricting mask reduce perturbations and improve perceptual metrics (PSNR/SSIM) but require more computation; iterative methods (PGD/C&W) fare better under localization than FGSM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the underexplored area of localized adversarial noise, systematically evaluating FGSM, PGD, and C&W to quantify effectiveness, imperceptibility, and efficiency, with implications for defense design.

Method: Introduce a binary mask to constrain perturbations to specific regions and compare FGSM, PGD, and C&W against global attacks. Measure mean pixel perturbation, PSNR, SSIM, and Attack Success Rate (ASR), along with computational cost. Analyze robustness of single-step vs iterative methods under localization.

Result: Localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean perturbations and higher PSNR/SSIM than global attacks, but incur higher computational cost and exhibit a modest drop in ASR. Iterative methods (PGD/C&W) are more robust to localization constraints than FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and perceptual-quality metrics.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for developing stronger attack strategies and informing robust defense design; localization presents a trade-off between imperceptibility, success rate, and computation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

### [357] [In-Context Learning can Perform Continual Learning Like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22764)
*Liuwang Kang,Fan Wang,Shaoshan Liu,Hung-Chyun Chou,Chuan Lin,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICCL enables long-term retention and cross-task knowledge gain for LLMs via task scheduling and prompt rearrangement; distributed practice yields a retention 'sweet spot'; human-like retention patterns emerge, especially in linear-attention models; inference-only CL mitigates forgetting and supports stability-plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether in-context learning can support long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation in multitask sequences, drawing inspiration from human memory studies, and assess how prompt design and task scheduling affect retention.

Method: Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks with multiple LLMs; induce ICCL through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement; test distributed practice effects; develop a human-retention similarity metric; compare linear-attention models (MAMBA, RWKV) against Transformer-based LLMs.

Result: Distributed practice reveals a spacing sweet spot for retention in ICCL; continual learning reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves cross-task retention; linear-attention models show more human-like retention dynamics despite lagging in raw retention performance; a human-retention similarity metric quantifies alignment with human memory patterns.

Conclusion: ICCL is both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only continual learning paradigm that mitigates forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

### [358] [Communication-Efficient and Interoperable Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22823)
*Mounssif Krouka,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework enabling collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures via a common fusion-layer output, allowing partition into personalized base blocks and modular generalized blocks; shares fusion outputs to preserve privacy and reduce communication, aiming to outperform FL and FSL baselines while maintaining training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interoperability and privacy challenges in cross-architecture collaborative learning, while reducing communication overhead inherent in Federated Learning and related methods.

Method: Introduce a fixed-dimension fusion-layer output that all clients agree on. Each model is partitioned into a private base block and a generalized modular block. Clients exchange only fusion-layer outputs rather than model parameters, enabling heterogeneity, modular composition during inference, and privacy preservation. Evaluate on heterogeneous architectures against FL and FSL baselines, focusing on communication efficiency and training stability.

Result: Demonstrates superior communication efficiency compared to FL and FSL baselines, with stable training performance across heterogeneous architectures.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for cross-architecture collaborative learning by decoupling model specifics from joint inference via a shared fusion output, enabling privacy-preserving, communication-efficient collaboration; potential trade-offs include the design of the fusion layer and its impact on model expressiveness.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [359] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) to quantify self-attention capacity: derives a tight capacity law D_K = Θ(m' log m'/d_model) for recovering m' directed edges, and shows distributing the key-query budget across multiple heads mitigates interference under compression; single head suffices without compression and when embeddings are uncompressed and m = d_model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize how many distinct relations a single self-attention layer can reliably recover under a given resource budget, addressing a gap in theoretical understanding and guiding architectural design.

Method: Analytical derivation of a capacity scaling law using information-theoretic arguments, with explicit constructions proving sufficiency; broad class of graphs (including permutations) analyzed; controlled single-layer experiments validate the threshold; comparison of compressed vs uncompressed regimes; exploration of multi-head budget allocation.

Result: Establishes D_K = Θ(m' log m'/d_model) as a necessary and sufficient condition to recover m' relations for many graphs; provides a capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention; shows compression introduces interference that multiple smaller heads can mitigate; empirical results reveal a sharp capacity threshold that aligns with theory.

Conclusion: Gives a concrete, scalable law for self-attention capacity and a practical rule for allocating key-query resources across heads, informing design choices especially under dimensional compression.

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

### [360] [Boundary on the Table: Efficient Black-Box Decision-Based Attacks for Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22850)
*Roie Kazoom,Yuval Ratzabi,Etamar Rothstein,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a black-box, decision-based adversarial attack for tabular data that uses gradient-free direction estimation and iterative boundary search to perturb both discrete and continuous features, achieving high success rates with few queries across diverse models, including LLM-based pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness in structured/tabular data is underexplored compared to vision and language, yet real-world decision systems rely on tabular models; understanding attack surface and needed defenses is critical.

Method: A gradient-free direction estimation method operating in mixed discrete/continuous feature spaces, combined with an iterative boundary search under limited oracle access to craft perturbations that flip model decisions in a black-box, decision-based setting.

Result: The attack compromises a large portion of the test set across diverse models, with success rates above 90% and a small number of queries per instance, indicating a strong vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Tabular models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in black-box settings; there is an urgent need for robust defenses and evaluation methodologies in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

### [361] [Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22851)
*Yaswanth Chittepu,Prasann Singhal,Greg Durrett,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce DPO-PoP, an adaptive-margin extension to Direct Preference Optimization that uses preference-over-preference signals to infer per-datapoint margins, boosting discriminative and generative performance on UltraFeedback; reveals a discriminative–generative tradeoff and offers two sampling strategies to collect PoP labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF margin formulations are static, rely on ratings, or ignore strength of preferences, leading to suboptimal generalization and misalignment. Preference strength is heterogeneous and noisy; a per-example adaptive margin informed by ordinal preference-over-preference signals can improve learning.

Method: Extend Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to DPO-PoP by incorporating adaptive margins inferred from preference-over-preference supervision. Use ordinal PoP labels to infer per-example margins. Propose two sampling strategies: one prioritizing discriminative performance, the other prioritizing generative performance.

Result: DPO-PoP outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on UltraFeedback. Identifies a discriminative–generative tradeoff: improving classification accuracy on weaker preferences may reduce generative quality. Provides two PoP-based sampling strategies to navigate this tradeoff.

Conclusion: Adaptive margins learned from preference-over-preference supervision enhance alignment and generalization in RLHF, but balancing discriminative and generative objectives is crucial. The paper offers practical strategies to collect PoP signals to steer this balance.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Nikhil Karamchandani,Sharayu Mohair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CascadeOFA and PBMOFA, two adversarial attacks on OLTR algorithms (CascadeUCB1 and PBM-UCB) that promote target items for nearly all rounds while incurring linear regret; proves O(log T) manipulations suffice and validates with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OLTR systems are widely deployed but their vulnerability to coordinated adversarial attacks is poorly understood. The work aims to formalize an attack framework, quantify manipulation efficiency, and demonstrate practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a general adversarial framework for attacking OLTR; develops CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB; establishes theoretical guarantees that only O(log T) manipulations are needed to achieve top-K promotion of a target set during T-o(T) rounds while inducing linear regret; supports claims with experiments on real-world datasets.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows both attack strategies achieve success with only O(log T) manipulations; empirical experiments corroborate effectiveness on real-world data, illustrating practical feasibility of the attacks.

Conclusion: OLTR algorithms are vulnerable to coordinated attacks, and lightweight manipulation can both drive target items to the top and cause substantial regret. The work highlights the need for robust defenses and motivates future research on hardening OLTR against such adversarial strategies.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

### [363] [Neighborhood Sampling Does Not Learn the Same Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22868)
*Zehao Niu,Mihai Anitescu,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural tangent kernel analysis shows finite-sample posteriors differ across neighborhood sampling methods in GNNs, but all converge to the same posterior as sample size grows; posterior covariance is incomparable, explaining lack of a clear winner among sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the systematic behavior of neighborhood sampling in training large-scale GNNs, by connecting practice to theory using NTK/GP frameworks.

Method: Model training with infinitely wide networks via neural tangent kernel; study several established neighborhood sampling schemes and their induced posterior Gaussian processes; compare finite-sample posteriors and covariances.

Result: Finite-sample posteriors differ across sampling methods; asymptotically they converge to a common posterior; posterior covariance lower bounds the MSE differ and are incomparable across methods, implying no single sampling method dominates.

Conclusion: Neighborhood sampling affects finite-sample training dynamics but not the asymptotic limit under NTK; the lack of dominance among methods aligns with empirical observations; suggests careful choice of sampling based on finite-data performance.

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

*Karim Khamaisi,Nicolas Keller,Stefan Krummenacher,Valentin Huber,Bernhard Fässler,Bruno Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OC-SVM best trade-off for acoustic anomaly detection in hydropower plants among LSTM AE and K-Means; strong ROC AUC; OC-SVM faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned outages are costly; hydropower datasets are scarce; need robust acoustic preprocessing and reliable anomaly detection for predictive maintenance in noisy plant environments.

Method: Preprocess acoustics in noisy conditions; extract time- and frequency-domain features; benchmark LSTM Autoencoder, K-Means, and One-Class SVM on two real Rodundwerk II datasets (induced and real-world anomalies).

Result: One-Class SVM achieved best ROC AUC (0.966–0.998) with minimal training time; LSTM autoencoder also strong (0.889–0.997) but higher compute.

Conclusion: OC-SVM provides an efficient and effective approach for hydro plant acoustic anomaly detection; LSTM AE offers strong detection with higher cost; choice depends on constraints like computation vs. speed.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

TL;DR: Extends Conformal Fairness to Federated Learning and provides an auditing framework to assess fairness gaps across demographic groups in federated models, with empirical validation across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal Prediction offers probabilistic coverage guarantees but is typically unaware of sensitive attributes. There is a need to integrate fairness into CP, and to address fairness auditing in the more complex setting of Federated Learning.

Method: Extend the Conformal Fairness framework to Federated Learning and develop an auditing approach that analyzes fairness-related gaps for different demographic groups. Validate the framework empirically on datasets spanning multiple domains, leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Result: Demonstrates the viability of CF in a federated setting; provides a methodology to audit fairness by examining group-wise discrepancies; supports its effectiveness with empirical results across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The work bridges Conformal Fairness and Federated Learning, offering a practical auditing framework for fairness in federated models and validated through multi-domain experiments.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

*Jake S. Rhodes,Adam G. Rustad,Marshall S. Nielsen,Morgan Chase McClellan,Dallan Gardner,Dawson Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guided geometry-regularized twin autoencoder improves manifold alignment with out-of-sample generalization and multi-modal integration, boosting embedding fidelity and cross-domain transfer; demonstrated on Alzheimer's disease data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manifold alignment methods struggle with out-of-sample extension and cross-domain generalization. A geometry-aware, learnable framework with multitask objectives is needed to preserve geometric structure while enabling generalization to unseen data, including in biomedical multi-modal tasks.

Method: A geometry-regularized twin autoencoder architecture enforcing structured cross-modal mappings to preserve geometry, augmented by a pre-trained alignment model and multitask learning to boost cross-domain generalization and robustness; evaluated across several MA methods and applied to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis to fuse multi-modal patient data.

Result: The approach yields improvements in embedding consistency, information preservation, and cross-domain transfer across MA methods, and enhances predictive accuracy when integrating multi-modal data for Alzheimer's disease in settings with data from a single domain.

Conclusion: The proposed guided representation learning framework strengthens manifold alignment by enabling out-of-sample generalization and robust cross-domain alignment, with practical impact for multi-modal biomedical problems such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

### [367] [Rethinking Large Language Model Distillation: A Constrained Markov Decision Process Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22921)
*Matthieu Zimmer,Xiaotong Ji,Tu Nguyen,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled constrained RL-based distillation method for LLMs that maximizes task rewards while keeping the distillation close to the teacher, using a modified reward that guarantees constraint satisfaction without state augmentation or teacher access at deployment, and avoiding dual-Lagrangian overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM distillation by integrating task-specific rewards in a principled way while enforcing a divergence constraint from the teacher, addressing reliance on ad-hoc reward weighting and inefficiencies in existing methods.

Method: Formulate distillation as constrained reinforcement learning using a state-augmented framework with a modified reward ensuring constraint satisfaction. The approach avoids state augmentation and teacher access during deployment and bypasses dual Lagrangian optimization, offering a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for reward-aware distillation.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show higher constraint satisfaction and better reasoning performance compared to soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines, with competitive task performance.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded and practically efficient framework for reward-aware distillation under resource constraints, improving constraint adherence and reasoning without incurring heavy computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

*Shreyas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MonoCon uses a monotonic MLP head with functional constraints to produce compact, robust representations across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the central challenge of learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations by introducing a functional constraint-based approach, complementing architectural and optimization strategies.

Method: Attach a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron head to any pre-trained encoder. Train with contrastive loss while enforcing monotonicity constraints, allowing co-adaptation between encoder and head.

Result: On CIFAR-100, representations are ~9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than a fine-tuned encoder baseline, preserving ~99% of the baseline’s 5-NN accuracy. On SNLI, representations are ~3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust with a marginal STSb score reduction, indicating domain-agnostic applicability.

Conclusion: MonoCon offers a general, domain-agnostic framework that yields robust, ultra-compact representations suitable for diverse contexts from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

### [369] [Compute-Optimal Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22935)
*Aleksandr Dremov,David Grangier,Angelos Katharopoulos,Awni Hannun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization-aware training (QAT) efficiency: learn how to allocate compute between full-precision and QAT, derive a predictive loss-scaling law and a tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic, and introduce a cooldown+QAT fusion to save compute while achieving higher-quality quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the optimal split of compute between full-precision (FP) training and QAT to maximize final accuracy of quantized neural networks under a fixed compute budget.

Method: Conduct extensive experiments across multiple compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes (86M to 2.2B parameters). Derive a loss-scaling law predicting optimal QAT ratios and final performance. Introduce the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic to predict QAT planning across sizes/widths. Propose a cooldown and QAT fusion technique that learns rate decay jointly with QAT to save compute. Validate predictions experimentally.

Result: Findings show the loss-optimal QAT/FP ratio increases with total compute (contrary to some prior work). The scaling law can predict the optimal QAT ratio and final performance across allocation strategies and QAT widths. It informs which QAT bit width is optimal under memory constraints and how QAT accuracy with different widths compares to FP accuracy. The proposed cooldown+QAT fusion yields significant compute savings by eliminating redundant FP updates and integrating learning-rate decay with QAT.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for efficient QAT planning, enabling higher-quality quantized models under the same compute budget and offering a predictive framework for choosing QAT bit widths and allocation.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

### [370] [Understanding SOAP from the Perspective of Gradient Whitening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22938)
*Yanqing Lu,Letao Wang,Jinbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOAP's empirical gains arise from faster convergence rather than a lower final loss; theoretically, idealized SOAP and Shampoo are equivalent under a Kronecker-product assumption, linking their preconditioners to gradient whitening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP relate as gradient whitening preconditioners and whether SOAP offers a real advantage beyond convergence speed.

Method: Interpret preconditioners as approximations to a whitening matrix; prove equivalence between idealized SOAP and Shampoo under Kronecker-product structure; reproduce language-model (nanoGPT) and grayscale colorization experiments to compare convergence dynamics and final loss.

Result: SOAP achieves similar convergence rate to Shampoo, but does not surpass Adam or Shampoo in final loss; empirical findings align with the theoretical equivalence under the Kronecker assumption.

Conclusion: Under the Kronecker-product framework, SOAP and Shampoo are effectively equivalent in objective optimization; practical advantages of SOAP are limited to training dynamics rather than superior final performance.

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

### [371] [SINQ: Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization for Calibration-Free Low-Precision LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22944)
*Lorenz K. Müller,Philippe Bich,Jiawei Zhuang,Ahmet Çelik,Luca Benfenati,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINQ adds a second-axis scale and a Sinkhorn-Knopp–style normalization to post-training quantization, reducing matrix imbalance by aligning per-row/per-column variances; it improves perplexity over uncalibrated uniform PTQ on LLMs (Qwen3, DeepSeek-V2.5) and is easy to apply without inter-layer interactions; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration-free uniform PTQ suffers from perplexity degradation at low bit-widths due to outliers sharing scales with normal weights; there is a need for a scalable, layer-agnostic approach to stabilize quantization without per-layer calibration.

Method: Introduce a second-axis scale factor for weights. Use a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp–style algorithm to optimize scales to normalize per-row and per-column variances, minimizing a per-matrix proxy objective called matrix imbalance; no inter-layer coupling; applicable to quantizing any linear layers in new architectures.

Result: Significant perplexity improvements on WikiText2 and C4 against uncalibrated uniform PTQ baselines for Qwen3 family and DeepSeek-V2.5; gains can be further enhanced by combining with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: SINQ provides a simple, effective PTQ enhancement that targets matrix imbalance, is broadly applicable to linear layers, and can be combined with calibration or non-uniform quantization for additional gains.

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

*Hamidreza Moazzami,Asma Jamali,Nicholas Kevlahan,Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning with Fourier Neural Operator to approximate inverse Hessian in data assimilation, providing CG initialization; yields lower error and fewer iterations, especially in ill-conditioned problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational data assimilation is powerful but computationally expensive due to Hessian operations; a fast, robust initialization can dramatically reduce CG iterations.

Method: Train/learn a Fourier Neural Operator to emulate the inverse Hessian operator across a family of data-assimilation problems, using it to warm-start CG in variational DA.

Result: In linear advection experiments, the FNO-CG method reduces average relative error by 62% and CG iterations by 17%.

Conclusion: FNO-CG offers robustness and efficiency for challenging, ill-conditioned DA problems, suggesting meta-learned Hessian approximations as a practical acceleration for variational DA.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

*Valentyn Melnychuk,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Neyman-orthogonal (GDR) learners that flexibly estimate conditional distributions of potential outcomes using deep generative models, achieving quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models for potential-outcome distributions lack Neyman orthogonality and double robustness. There is a need for a flexible, theoretically sound framework that combines generative models with semiparametric efficiency properties to estimate conditional outcome distributions.

Method: Propose a general suite of GDR-learners that estimate conditional distributions of potential outcomes, instantiated with: (a) conditional normalizing flows (GDR-CNFs), (b) conditional GANs (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional VAEs (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models (GDR-CDMs). These learners achieve Neyman orthogonality, quasi-oracle efficiency, and rate double robustness, enabling asymptotically optimal estimation.

Result: Semi- and fully-synthetic experiments show that GDR-learners outperform existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes.

Conclusion: GDR-learners provide a flexible, theoretically grounded framework for estimating potential-outcome distributions that can be instantiated with various deep generative models, yielding improved empirical performance and strong asymptotic guarantees.

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

### [374] [Doubly-Robust LLM-as-a-Judge: Externally Valid Estimation with Imperfect Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22957)
*Luke Guerdan,Justin Whitehouse,Kimberly Truong,Kenneth Holstein,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a doubly-robust framework to fix evaluation sampling bias in GenAI by fusing persona-based LLM-evaluator ratings with biased human ratings; guarantees hold if either a predictive model using persona data or a bias-correcting reweighting model is high quality, with validation via a Persona Simulation Framework (PSF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GenAI systems are deployed, evaluation results often fail to generalize from lab settings to real-world use due to sampling bias in raters and outputs. This work seeks a principled method to obtain valid system-quality estimates under such external validity threats.

Method: Develop a doubly-robust estimator that combines persona ratings (generated by prompting an LLM to mimic human raters with specific sociodemographic traits) with biased human ratings. The estimator remains valid if (i) a model predicting human ratings from persona-and-source data under bias is sufficiently accurate, or (ii) a reweighting model correcting for sampling bias is sufficiently accurate. A novel Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) is introduced to systematically vary persona quality and the degree of evaluation sampling bias.

Result: The framework provides valid system-quality estimates under the stated conditions, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation through the PSF that demonstrates robustness to varying persona quality and sampling bias.

Conclusion: This work offers a principled foundation for integrating imperfect persona-based judgments with biased human ratings to obtain valid GenAI evaluation outcomes, advancing external validity in GenAI evaluations.

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

TL;DR: Discrete diffusion policies trained via policy mirror descent (PMD) improve stability and sample efficiency in large combinatorial action spaces, achieving state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning with large, combinatorial action spaces struggles with scalability and stable learning. The authors propose a diffusion-policy framework that leverages PMD to define a stable regularized target, enabling effective online training.

Method: Train a discrete diffusion model as the policy and perform a distributional matching update to a PMD-defined target distribution. The approach decouples learning of the target from policy optimization, improving stability and sample efficiency. Evaluated on benchmarks like DNA sequence generation, macro-actions RL, and multi-agent systems.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior sample efficiency on diverse combinatorial tasks, with diffusion policies outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based policies guided by policy mirror descent offer a stable, scalable approach to learning in combinatorial action spaces, delivering strong empirical gains across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

*Qinxun Bai,Yuxuan Han,Wei Xu,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new off-policy actor-critic framework using functional critic modeling to address deadly triad instability and moving-target policy changes, with theoretical convergence in linear settings and a neural-network realization showing preliminary DM Control results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome instability and inefficiency in off-policy actor-critic methods caused by the deadly triad and the moving-target issue, and to provide a practical algorithm that remains convergent and data-efficient.

Method: Introduce functional critic modeling within an off-policy actor-critic framework, derive theory proving convergence in the linear function approximation setting, and design a neural network architecture for the functional critic with preliminary experiments on DeepMind Control benchmarks.

Result: The framework is shown to converge in the linear setting (provable convergence) and a practical neural network implementation demonstrates efficacy in initial experiments on DM Control tasks.

Conclusion: Functional critic modeling enables a convergent, off-policy target-based actor-critic algorithm, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical viability, with promising preliminary results requiring further empirical validation.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

*Samuel V. Singh,Shirley Coyle,Mimi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAEclust is a functional autoencoder framework for clustering multi-dimensional functional data, using a universal-approximator encoder/decoder, regularization, and a shape-informed clustering objective to achieve robust clustering with invariance to phase variation; the decoder is proven to have universal approximation capability; validated by extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering complex, multi-dimensional functional data is challenging due to nonlinear dependencies, phase (shape) variation, and the need to handle Euclidean and manifold-valued data. Existing methods struggle with nonlinearity, misalignment, and variability across components; a unified framework with strong representation power and clustering-aware training is desirable.

Method: Propose FAEclust with a universal-approximator encoder and decoder that can reconstruct both Euclidean and manifold-valued functional data. Apply regularization on functional weights and biases to improve stability. Incorporate a clustering loss into the training objective and introduce a shape-informed clustering objective to resist phase variations. Prove the universal approximation property of the non-linear decoder. Validate via extensive experiments demonstrating improved clustering performance.

Result: The model demonstrates effective learning of latent representations conducive to clustering, with robustness to phase variations and the ability to reconstruct both Euclidean and manifold-valued functional data; experimental results support the claimed universal approximation and clustering effectiveness.

Conclusion: FAEclust offers a general, theoretically grounded framework for clustering multi-dimensional functional data, combining strong representational power, regularization, and shape-informed clustering. It accommodates both Euclidean and manifold-valued data and is validated by extensive experiments, indicating promising applicability to real-world functional datasets.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

TL;DR: Integrates optimization-domain knowledge into LLM-based MILP formulation via data cleaning and multi-turn, feedback-guided prompting, achieving about 14 percentage-point accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce errors when translating natural language into MILP by injecting domain knowledge and iterative refinement, addressing data scarcity and noisiness in training data.

Method: 1) Class-based error analysis to clean training data and prevent common mistakes per optimization class; 2) Class-specific error summaries guiding multi-turn inference; 3) Solver feedback for iterative refinement; 4) Evaluation across multiple base LLMs with domain-informed prompting.

Result: Average improvement of 14 percentage points in MILP formulation accuracy across several base LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-informed prompting combined with iterative solver feedback advances robust, automated LLM-assisted optimization formulation and moves toward reliable NL-to-MIP modeling.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

*David P. Morton,Oscar Dowson,Bernardo K. Pagnoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible multi-stage stochastic-programming framework blending MDPs with continuous state/action spaces, featuring decision-dependent transition uncertainty and limited learning, solved via new SDDP variants capable of handling non-convexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex decision problems with dynamics that depend on decisions and with an element of learning about uncertainty, in a continuous, multi-stage setting.

Method: Extend policy graphs to allow decision-dependent one-step transitions and incorporate a limited form of statistical learning; develop new variants of stochastic dual dynamic programming with approximations to handle non-convexities; illustrate through increasingly complex examples.

Result: Demonstrates expressiveness of the modeling approach via a progression of examples; proposes SDDP-based solution variants that address non-convexities in this setting.

Conclusion: Enriches the MDP-informed multi-stage stochastic programming framework with decision-dependent uncertainty and learning, and offers scalable SDDP-based methods applicable to a broad class of problems, while leaving room for further refinement.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-stage stochastic programs, which incorporate
modeling features from Markov decision processes (MDPs). This class includes
structured MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. We extend policy
graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for one-step transition
probabilities as well as a limited form of statistical learning. We focus on
the expressiveness of our modeling approach, illustrating ideas with a series
of examples of increasing complexity. As a solution method, we develop new
variants of stochastic dual dynamic programming, including approximations to
handle non-convexities.

### [380] [T-TAMER: Provably Taming Trade-offs in ML Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22992)
*Yuanyuan Yang,Ruimin Zhang,Jamie Morgenstern,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general multi-stage model serving framework (T-Tamer) that formalizes early-exit/cascaded models as a decision process and shows recall is necessary and sufficient for provable guarantees, enabling polynomial-time optimal trade-offs; validated on synthetic data and vision/NLP workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient model serving requires principled guarantees on accuracy vs. latency/resource trade-offs, especially with cascaded models and early exits. Current strategies are heuristic with limited theoretical guarantees.

Method: Introduce T-Tamer framework as a multi-stage decision process to decide when to exit and which model to consult. Prove that recall (ability to revisit earlier models) is necessary and sufficient for provable performance guarantees. Show that non-recall strategies cannot achieve constant-factor approximations, while recall-based strategies can achieve the optimal trade-off in polynomial time. Validate with experiments on synthetic datasets and early-exit workloads for vision and NLP.

Result: Theoretically, recall is both necessary and sufficient for provable guarantees; non-recall strategies fail to achieve a constant-factor approximation, while recall-based strategies attain the optimal trade-off in polynomial time. Empirically, recall-based strategies yield efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs on synthetic data and vision/NLP benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work provides a principled foundation for designing early-exit and cascaded models with theoretical guarantees, bridging heuristic practice and theory, and highlighting recall as a central component for optimal trade-offs.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

### [381] [Analysis of Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22994)
*Zachary Baker,Yuxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vSAE with stochastic Gaussian sampling and KL regularization does not improve feature organization or interpretability relative to a standard SAE; excessive regularization reduces alive features, though robustness improves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and organization of sparse autoencoders by introducing probabilistic latent representations and variational regularization.

Method: Replace deterministic ReLU gating with sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors; apply KL divergence toward a standard normal prior; compare TopK vSAE and TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual activations; evaluate with SAE Bench, feature interpretability analysis, and t-SNE latent-space visualization.

Result: vSAE underperforms on core evaluation metrics; KL term imposes strong regularization that drastically reduces the fraction of living features, leading to degraded performance; more dead features observed; robustness improves.

Conclusion: Naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

### [382] [Sample-efficient Multiclass Calibration under $\ell_{p}$ Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23000)
*Konstantina Bairaktari,Huy L. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a tunable calibration error for multiclass predictors that interpolates between two existing notions with different sample complexities, and presents an algorithm that calibrates across almost the entire interpolation range using polynomial samples, with near-optimal error dependence at one endpoint. A key technical tool is adaptive data analysis with high adaptivity and low sample overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of multiclass predictors is challenging due to the exponential number of possible prediction outputs. Existing calibration notions impose tradeoffs between sample complexity and the accuracy of calibration; the work seeks a unified, flexible measure that can be tuned to balance these resources.

Method: Define a new interpolation-based calibration error that bridges two traditional notions. Develop an algorithm that calibrates any given predictor over the full interpolation range except for one endpoint, using only polynomially many samples. At the opposite endpoint, achieve near-optimal dependence on the error parameter. Leverage adaptive data analysis with high adaptivity but only logarithmic sample overhead.

Result: The proposed calibration framework achieves polynomial sample complexity across most of the interpolation range, and near-optimal dependence on the error parameter at the endpoint. It advances previous work by improving sample efficiency and offering a flexible, unified calibration notion.

Conclusion: A tunable calibration error can unify and improve calibration efficiency for multiclass predictors. The approach highlights adaptive data analysis as a critical component to attain low sample complexity under high adaptivity, enabling practical calibration across a broad range of settings.

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

### [383] [Physically Plausible Multi-System Trajectory Generation and Symmetry Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23003)
*Jiayin Liu,Yulong Yang,Vineet Bansal,Christine Allen-Blanchette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPS-GAN is a symplectic phase-space conditional GAN that jointly learns dynamics of multiple mechanical systems, discovers configuration-space structure from varied measurements, and generalizes to unseen parameters, matching single-system supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many physics-informed neural nets focus on a single system with fixed parameters and known configuration space. There is a need for models that generalize across multiple systems, infer the underlying configuration-space structure, and handle diverse measurement types (e.g., state-space, video).

Method: Embed a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module inside a conditional GAN backbone (SPS-GAN). Add a physics-inspired term to the conditional time-series GAN objective to encourage a sparse representation of the configuration space, enabling discovery of configuration-space structure from arbitrary measurements.

Result: Demonstrates trajectory prediction, video generation, and symmetry discovery across multiple systems. Achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems, indicating effective generalization.

Conclusion: SPS-GAN enables multi-system dynamics learning and configuration-space discovery from diverse measurements, with competitive performance and potential for broad physics-based generative tasks.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

*Lauren. A Hannah,Soheil Zibakhsh,Kumari Nishu,Arnav Kundu,Mohammad Samragh Razlighi,Mehrdad Farajtabar,Minsik Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A single pretrained MoE model can offer flexible, global sparsity control at inference through Post Hoc Declared Sparsity (PHDS), removing the need for multiple models or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and maintenance burden of training and deploying multiple models for different sparsity/latency targets in sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs).

Method: Introduce PHDS, a lightweight post-training sparsity-declaration technique that converts one checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. It trains across multiple sparsity levels with a short curriculum at high sparsity and requires no architectural changes.

Result: PHDS enables predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from a single model, matches or exceeds oracle models, and improves cross-sparsity agreement (up to 22%); it simplifies runtime MoE deployment by making global sparsity a primary serving primitive.

Conclusion: Global sparsity can be managed as a first-class serving primitive using post hoc sparsity declaration, enabling flexible, dialable inference without re-training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

### [385] [On the Sheafification of Higher-Order Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23020)
*Jacob Hume,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sheaf-theoretic diffusion provides a principled, data-aware generalization of higher-order message passing beyond Hodge-Laplacian biases, linking k-dimensional features to sheaf cohomology and outlining a theory-practice framework for higher-order TD learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize graph-based message passing to higher-order relational structures (simplicial/cell complexes, hypergraphs) and address the opaque/degenerate inductive biases of the Hodge Laplacian in higher dimensions; introduce a data-aware cohomological prior via sheaves.

Method: Propose the sheaf Laplacian as the diffusion operator for higher-order TD learning, relate diffusion to dimension-k sheaf cohomology, critically assess prior k=0 theory and its failure to generalize to k>0, and develop new theory and practical guidelines for higher-order diffusion; provide a self-contained introduction from abstract to applied.

Result: Outlines a novel theoretical/practical framework for higher-order TD learning based on sheaf diffusion, clarifying limitations of naive generalizations of Hodge Laplacian and proposing a data-aware, cohomology-informed approach for k>0.

Conclusion: Sheaf theory offers a natural, principled framework to generalize HOMP to higher orders, with a self-contained introduction and planned development of theory and practice to address k>0 challenges.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

### [386] [Tracing the Representation Geometry of Language Models from Pretraining to Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23024)
*Melody Zixuan Li,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Arna Ghosh,Komal Kumar Teru,Adam Santoro,Guillaume Lajoie,Blake A. Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral geometry reveals three autoregressive pretraining phases (warmup, entropy-seeking, compression-seeking) in LLM representations, with post-training methods reshaping geometry to improve in-distribution performance but affecting robustness or diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training loss does not explain emergent capabilities of large language models. A spectral, geometry-based view (RankMe and alpha-ReQ) can reveal how representations evolve during pretraining and after fine-tuning or RL-based alignment.

Method: Compute RankMe and alpha-ReQ on OLMo (1B–7B) and Pythia (160M–12B) across autoregressive pretraining to identify geometric phases. Analyze post-training updates (SFT, DPO, RLVR) to see how they shift the eigenspectrum and effective dimensionality.

Result: Identified a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during pretraining: warmup with rapid representational collapse, entropy-seeking with expanded manifold and peak memorization, and compression-seeking with anisotropic consolidation and downstream gains. Post-training, SFT/DPO push entropy-seeking to integrate instruction/data, boosting in-distribution performance but reducing out-of-distribution robustness; RLVR promotes compression-seeking, improving reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.

Conclusion: Geometric phases arise from the interaction of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks (d ≪ |V|). Spectral metrics capture these dynamics and explain how post-training objectives re-shape representations, enabling task alignment at the cost of robustness or diversity.

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

*Yuke Li,Yujia Zheng,Tianyi Xiong,Zhenyi Wang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent-variable identifiability framework to mitigate catastrophic interference by identifying shared latent representations between partial-task aware and all-task aware setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand catastrophic forgetting from a latent representation perspective and quantify forgetting as a distance between PTA and ATA, enabling mitigation via identifiability theory.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) maximum likelihood estimation to learn latent representations from PTA and ATA; (2) minimize KL divergence to identify and learn shared latent variables; theoretical guarantees derived.

Result: Shows that identifying and learning shared latent representations reduces interference; provides theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements on synthetic and benchmark data.

Conclusion: The framework offers principled guarantees and practical gains in mitigating catastrophic interference by aligning latent representations across task configurations.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

*Yang Lv,Jin Cao,Ben Niu,Zhe Sun,Fengwei Wang,Fenghua Li,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A personalized DP federated learning framework that uses sample-level representations and a privacy-aware NAS to tailor architectures and hyperparameters per client under differential privacy, with convergence guarantees and superior accuracy and efficiency on CIFAR-10/100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge data in federated learning is sensitive and heterogeneous. A unified global model may underperform due to diverse local distributions, and sharing parameters risks data reconstruction. There's a need for personalized privacy-preserving FL that adapts models to local data while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Method: 1) Use sample-level representations for knowledge sharing instead of raw parameter sharing. 2) Apply a personalized differential privacy strategy to resist reconstruction attacks, providing client-specific privacy budgets. 3) Develop a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) that yields locally customized architectures and hyperparameters under privacy constraints, enabling distribution-aware adaptation. 4) Provide theoretical convergence guarantees for the personalized DP FL framework.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 shows a 6.82% accuracy improvement over the Federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS. The proposed approach reduces model size to 1/10 and communication cost to 1/20, while maintaining strong privacy protections and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. It achieves strong privacy for training data while delivering notable performance gains and efficiency improvements over existing FL approaches.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GuardNet is a hierarchical graph-based defense that detects jailbreak prompts at both prompt and token levels, yielding large F1 gains and IoU improvements while maintaining latency and cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks threaten LLM safety; current defenses struggle with both global prompts and fine-grained spans; a structure-aware, two-level approach is needed.

Method: Construct graphs fusing sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations; apply two-level graph neural networks: a prompt-level filter for global prompts and a token-level filter for adversarial spans.

Result: Significant performance gains across three datasets and multiple attacks: prompt-level F1 improved from 66.4% to 99.8% on LLM-Fuzzer and from 67–79% to >94% on PLeak; token-level F1 improved from 48–75% to 74–91%, IoU gains up to 28%; latency acceptable; good cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: GuardNet offers a practical, robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments by effectively detecting both global jailbreak prompts and fine-grained adversarial spans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

*Saleh Bunaiyan,Corentin Delacour,Shuvro Chowdhury,Kyle Lee,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural global proposals (IsingFormer) accelerate Parallel Tempering by proposing entire spin configurations, yielding faster sampling and improved optimization across 2D Ising, 3D spin glasses, and factoring problems; generalizes to unseen temperatures and instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCMC mixes slowly near critical points and rugged landscapes; need faster mixing and better global moves; leverage learned global structure to move beyond local flips.

Method: Train a Transformer on equilibrium samples from Ising-like distributions; generate whole-spin configurations as proposals in a Metropolis step within Parallel Tempering; combine with standard single-spin flips. Evaluate on 2D Ising sampling across temperatures (including critical region), 3D spin glasses optimization, and integer factorization encoded as Ising; test generalization to unseen temperatures and unseen semiprimes.

Result: Even a single neural proposal drastically reduces equilibration time; reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves; generalizes to unseen temperatures; finds substantially lower-energy states in 3D spin glasses; transfers to unseen semiprimes, increasing success rates beyond training distribution.

Conclusion: Learning global proposals with neural models can systematically accelerate Monte Carlo methods and optimization by capturing global structure, enabling faster sampling, better optimization, and transferability across instances and problem families.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new FL paradigm where the server guides the allocation of new tasks to the most suitable client via an empirical likelihood-based framework that jointly learns local models and client matching; shows improved accuracy and routing precision on benchmarks; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical heterogeneity across clients in FL, particularly in healthcare, motivates a system where the central server not only aggregates but also leverages heterogeneity to route new tasks to the best client.

Method: An empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously learns effective local models on each client and discovers the best matching client for a new query.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets show improvements in both model accuracy and precision of client guidance versus standard FL methods; code released.

Conclusion: Presents a new direction for intelligent, resource-efficient FL that treats heterogeneity as a feature; future work could explore scalability, privacy implications, and broader domains; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

### [392] [Understanding Language Prior of LVLMs by Contrasting Chain-of-Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23050)
*Lin Long,Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a layer-wise analysis of LVLMs to study language prior, revealing a Visual Integration Point (VIP) where vision starts shaping representations; proposes Total Visual Integration (TVI) to measure visual influence; empirical validation across 54 model-dataset combos shows VIP is universal and TVI predicts language prior strength, offering a diagnostic toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond input-output probing and understand the internal mechanisms by which visual information influences LVLMs, specifically when the visual signal alters the model’s decoding rather than relying on memorized language priors.

Method: Perform a chain-of-embedding analysis to track layer-wise representations in LVLMs. Identify a Visual Integration Point (VIP) where visual information begins to meaningfully affect hidden states. Develop the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator to measure representation distance beyond VIP to quantify visual influence on response generation. Validate across 9 LVLMs and 6 benchmarks (54 model-dataset combinations).

Result: A universal VIP is observed across all tested setups. TVI reliably correlates with the strength of the language prior, enabling prediction of how much the model relies on visual evidence versus memorized language patterns. The methodology provides a principled diagnostic toolkit for LVLM language prior analysis.

Conclusion: The study offers a rigorous, generalizable framework to diagnose and quantify language priors in LVLMs by pinpointing the onset of visual influence (VIP) and quantifying it via TVI, with broad empirical support across diverse models and datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

### [393] [Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052)
*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learned, dynamical-learning-rate scheduler uses hyperparameter-search data to predict long-term-optimal LR schedules, improving generalization and achieving SOTA results on CNN/ResNet image tasks and Transformer next-token prediction, with optimizer-agnostic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning rate schedules rely on simple parametric forms or short-term signals and miss a global view of training dynamics; a model of training as a dynamical system could leverage historical trajectories to optimize long-term performance.

Method: Train a model on hyperparameter-search runs to learn a latent representation of training dynamics. Given current metrics, it predicts a future learning-rate schedule that yields the best long-term validation performance; produces specialized schedules that deviate from standard curves; optimizer-agnostic and lightweight to integrate with experiment-tracking platforms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results for image classification with CNN/ResNet and for next-token prediction with a Transformer; schedules place training in flatter regions of the loss landscape, improving generalization compared to other schedules.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes beyond observed dynamics, enables tailored schedules, and is computationally efficient and easy to integrate; a public implementation will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

### [394] [Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074)
*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Spectral Coherence Predictability framework with SCP and LUR to measure task difficulty and how models use predictable information in time-series forecasting; reveals predictability drift and a trade-off where complex models excel on low-predictability data and linear models on high-predictability data; advocates predictability-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking conflates data unpredictability with model performance, hindering fair comparisons and understanding of model behavior; a predictability-aligned evaluation is needed.

Method: Introduce SCP (spectral coherence-based, O(N log N)) as a task-aligned forecastability score and LUR (Linear Utilization Ratio) as a frequency-resolved diagnostic of how effectively a model leverages linearly predictable info. Validate on time-series forecasting tasks to reveal task difficulty and model behavior.

Result: Evidence of two core insights: (1) predictability drift over time, i.e., task difficulty varies sharply; (2) a clear architectural trade-off: complex models outperform on low-predictability data, while linear models perform well on highly predictable data.

Conclusion: Shift evaluation away from aggregate scores toward predictability-aware metrics to enable fairer model comparisons and deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

### [395] [CLAD-Net: Continual Activity Recognition in Multi-Sensor Wearable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23077)
*Reza Rahimi Azghan,Gautham Krishna Gudur,Mohit Malu,Edison Thomaz,Giulia Pedrielli,Pavan Turaga,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net is a continual learning framework for wearable HAR that uses a self-supervised transformer as long-term memory and a knowledge-distilled CNN to handle subject-wise distribution shifts, achieving high accuracy with low forgetting (91.36% accuracy, 8.78% forgetting on PAMAP2) and robustness to label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In HAR, sensor data distributions shift across subjects, and labeled data is scarce. A continual learning approach is needed to adapt to new subjects without catastrophically forgetting prior knowledge.

Method:  CLAD-Net employs a self-supervised transformer (with cross-attention across sensors) as long-term memory to learn global activity representations without labels, paired with a supervised CNN trained via knowledge distillation to retain prior learning during subject-wise fine-tuning. The framework is evaluated against memory-based and regularization baselines, and includes semi-supervised settings.

Result: On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36% final accuracy with 8.78% forgetting, outperforming Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. It remains robust in semi-supervised settings with only 10-20% labeled data. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: CLAD-Net effectively enables continual learning for HAR under subject-induced distribution shifts and label scarcity by combining a cross-attentive self-supervised transformer memory with distillation-based retention mechanisms, achieving strong accuracy with low forgetting.

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

### [396] [Signal Preserving Weight Initialization for Odd-Sigmoid Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23085)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an odd-sigmoid activation class with a closed-form noise-scale initialization that preserves dispersed forward activations up to a target depth, enabling reliable training without normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation functions and weight initialization are interdependent; without appropriate initialization nonlinearities can cause saturation, variance collapse, and learning-rate sensitivity. A method that couples activation class with initialization can stabilize forward propagation.

Method: Define an odd sigmoid activation function class and, for any activation f in this class, derive a closed-form initialization that selects a noise scale to keep forward activations well dispersed up to a target layer, avoiding collapse or saturation.

Result: Empirically trains reliably without normalization layers, shows strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations where standard initializations (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often fail to converge.

Conclusion: Tailored initialization matched to the activation nonlinearity improves trainability, reduces sensitivity to initialization, and can remove the need for normalization layers in training.

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

### [397] [Unleashing Flow Policies with Distributional Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23087)
*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Distributional Flow Critic (DFC): a flow-based critic that models the full return distribution via flow matching, offering distributional Bellman targets and improved performance for multimodal actions in offline and offline-to-online RL (D4RL and OGBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow-based critics provide a single scalar estimate, which is insufficient to capture multimodal returns and can hinder learning from rich offline datasets. A distributional critic can provide richer, more informative targets and stabilize training.

Method: Introduce Distributional Flow Critic (DFC) that uses flow matching to learn the return distribution for state-action pairs. The critic models the distribution as a continuous transformation from a base distribution through a normalizing-flow-like mapping. This distributional critic provides a distributional Bellman target to the flow-based policy and is trained in offline and offline-to-online settings.

Result: Empirical evaluation on D4RL and OGBench shows strong performance, especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, with improvements in both offline learning and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: DFC demonstrates that learning the full return distribution with a flow-based critic yields richer targets and improved performance for flow-based policies in offline and offline-to-online RL, particularly for multimodal action scenarios.

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

*Sylee,Beltiukov,Satyandra Guthula,Wenbo Guo,Walter Willinger,Arpit Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic latent-knowledge analysis of Network Foundation Models (NFMs) using three diagnostic axes—Embedding Geometry, Metric Alignment, and Causal Sensitivity—across five datasets and four NFMs. Findings show strong anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity, and entanglement of high-level context with payload; addressing these limitations can boost F1 by up to 0.35 without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap between downstream task performance and what latent representations encode in NFMs. Provide diagnostic tools to understand representation geometry, domain-feature alignment, and robustness to protocol perturbations.

Method: Three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis, Metric Alignment Assessment, and Causal Sensitivity Testing applied to five diverse datasets (controlled and real-world) and four state-of-the-art NFMs to probe representation space usage, feature-sensitivity consistency, and robustness to perturbations.

Result: All four NFMs show significant anisotropy and inconsistent feature-sensitivity patterns; they struggle to separate high-level context from payload and exhibit context-payload entanglement across datasets. Identifying these limitations yields potential performance gains (up to +0.35 F1) without changing architecture.

Conclusion: The study reveals pervasive latent-knowledge limitations in NFMs and demonstrates that targeted latent-analysis diagnostics can guide improvements in performance without architectural changes, highlighting the value of embedding-geometry, feature-alignment, and causal-robustness analyses.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

### [399] [Sensitivity Analysis for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23092)
*Christopher Scarvelis,Justin Solomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A closed-form method to differentiate the diffusion-score map with respect to training data, enabling fast sensitivity estimates of samples under small data perturbations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict how a diffusion model's score function and samples change when the training data (or target measure) is slightly perturbed, avoiding costly retraining.

Method: Derive directional derivatives of the map from data distribution to the optimal score using only black-box access to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives w.r.t. inputs; extend to additive perturbations of the target measure; runtime comparable to diffusion sampling and log-likelihood evaluation; robust to numerical/approximation errors.

Result: Provides a closed-form procedure for computing the map's directional derivatives; sensitivities correlate with sample changes after retraining/fine-tuning and have practical runtime.

Conclusion: Enables practical sensitivity analysis of diffusion models to training data changes, offering a tool to anticipate retraining effects without full retraining.

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

*Xiangqi Wang,Yue Huang,Yujun Zhou,Xiaonan Luo,Kehan Guo,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-PO is a drop-in reward-shaping method that augments policy optimization with a differentiable causal coherence proxy along the Z->X->Y generation path; uses Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens signals, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task accuracy via a Minkowski combiner to trade off between accuracy and coherence; integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes and improves robustness and reduces reward hacking, with near-parity accuracy and average accuracy gains (~5.49%, up to 9.58%) across 4 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pro: LLMs trained with reinforcement objectives can rely on shortcut strategies that yield superficially correct answers but are unfaithful in reasoning and fragile to small causal perturbations. Goal: enforce causal coherence along the reasoning chain (prompt Z -> rationale X -> answer Y) to improve faithfulness and robustness.

Method: Propose CE-PO: a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the Z->X->Y path; estimates model-internal influence via Jacobian sensitivities; counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues; fuses coherence with task-accuracy feedback using a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner to yield a single tunable balance between accuracy and coherence; can be plugged into PPO or GRPO without changing architecture.

Result: Empirically reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits; achieves near-parity accuracy; across 4 datasets, average accuracy improvement of 5.49% (max 9.58%).

Conclusion: CE-PO provides a practical, tunable reward-shaping framework that enhances causal coherence and robustness of LLM reasoning without requiring architectural changes, achieving meaningful accuracy gains while mitigating shortcut-driven failures; effective across reasoning benchmarks and causal stress tests.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

TL;DR: An ensemble of GCN, GAT, and GIN with soft voting improves blockchain fraud detection on the Elliptic dataset, achieving high recall with a false positive rate under 1%, outperforming individual GNNs and baselines, and featuring a modular, quantum-ready design for future quantum integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain networks enable value transfer but rely on pseudonymous activity, making AML enforcement challenging. There is a need for models that capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining robust to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior.

Method: A tuned soft voting ensemble that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to detect illicit transactions on the Elliptic real-world dataset; the architecture is modular with quantum-ready hooks to facilitate future quantum feature mappings and quantum-classical graph neural networks.

Result: The ensemble achieves high recall for illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNNs and baseline methods.

Conclusion: Ensemble GNNs offer a practical, forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring with immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics; the approach emphasizes scalability, robustness, and adaptability.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 8-bit Muon with blockwise quantization achieves near-Muon performance with ~74% memory reduction vs full-precision Muon, and outperforms AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in large-scale pretraining (1.6B model on 4B tokens) and shows competitive results for Llama 3.2 3B fine-tuning, with demonstrated stability under both linear and dynamic quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory overhead and improve quantization robustness for a stateful optimizer (Muon) used in large-language-model training, addressing the fragility of 8-bit AdamW under quantization and enabling efficient 8-bit training.

Method: Introduce 8-bit Muon using blockwise quantization that supports both linear and dynamic quantization schemes. Analyze stability under both schemes and provide a theoretical perspective. Empirically evaluate on pretraining a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens and fine-tuning a Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data, comparing against Muon, AdamW, and 8-bit AdamW.

Result: 8-bit Muon achieves ~74% memory footprint reduction compared to full-precision Muon. It maintains stability under both linear and dynamic quantization while closely matching Muon’s performance and outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pretraining a 1.6B model on 4B tokens. It also yields competitive results for fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model. The paper provides a theoretical perspective explaining robustness under quantization.

Conclusion: 8-bit Muon with blockwise quantization delivers quantization-robust, memory-efficient optimization for LLM training and fine-tuning, preserving Muon’s advantages while substantially reducing memory overhead; the work also contributes a theoretical explanation for observed robustness under both quantization schemes.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

*Haoyu He,Haozheng Luo,Yan Chen,Qi R. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHYTHM uses hierarchical temporal tokenization and frozen LLMs to forecast human mobility efficiently, achieving accuracy gains with shorter sequences and reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility has long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodicity; existing methods struggle with scalability. LLMs offer general spatio-temporal reasoning; need a framework that leverages tokens and hierarchical attention while limiting compute.

Method: Temporal tokenization into daily segments; hierarchical attention to capture daily/weekly patterns; augment token embeddings with pre-computed prompt embeddings from a frozen LLM; feed combined embeddings back into LLM backbone; freeze backbone to reduce attention cost; evaluate on three real-world datasets; compare to SOTA; code released.

Result: 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy; 5.0% improvement on weekends; 24.6% reduction in training time.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of RHYTHM in modeling multi-scale temporal dependencies for mobility, offering accurate and efficient predictions with LLMs and tokenization.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is
publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

TL;DR: Impute-MACFM introduces a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular imputation that handles missing data under MCAR/MAR/MNAR using trajectories focused on missing entries, stability constraints, consistency regularization, and time-decayed noise, solved via constraint-preserving ODE integration.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in tabular, especially longitudinal healthcare data, is widespread and challenging. Existing methods either rely on restrictive assumptions or struggle with cross-feature structure or instability and costly inference in generative approaches. A flexible, stable, and efficient imputation method is needed.

Method: The method builds on mask-aware conditional flow matching (Impute-MACFM). It constructs trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to be near zero on observed entries. It uses three components: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii) consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving ODE integration with per-step projection to fix observed values and can aggregate multiple trajectories for robustness.

Result: Empirically, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art imputation results across diverse benchmarks, delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputations than competing approaches.

Conclusion: Flow matching is a promising direction for tabular missing-data problems, including longitudinal data, offering robust imputation under multiple missingness mechanisms with improved stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

*Haotian Liu,Shuo Wang,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes C^2GSPG, a confidence-calibrated Group Sequence Policy Gradient to improve reasoning accuracy while reducing overconfidence in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based reasoning methods (e.g., GRPO) suffer from critical overconfidence, hindering self-aware reasoning; a calibration mechanism is needed.

Method: Introduce the Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework and a confidence-calibration regularizer. Define sequence-level confidence from normalized probabilities, apply a cross-entropy regularizer to align confidence with the sequence reward; for binary rewards the gradients align, for non-binary rewards use nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping. Apply to post-train LLMs on logical and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Result: C^2GSPG shows superior reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods on logical/mathematical tasks; code is released.

Conclusion: Confidence-calibrated GSPG mitigates token-level bias and overconfidence, enabling more self-aware reasoning in language models; effective across binary and non-binary reward settings with appropriate normalization and clipping.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces TRRO, a stable IRL framework with monotonic improvement guarantees, instantiated as PIRO, achieving competitive reward recovery and policy imitation with high sample efficiency on standard benchmarks and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial IRL methods are prone to instability during training, while non-adversarial energy-based IRL lacks formal guarantees. A unified, stable, theoretically grounded approach is needed to reliably recover rewards and imitate expert behavior.

Method: Shows that canonical non-adversarial IRL methods implicitly/maximize the likelihood of expert behavior (equivalently minimizing the expected return gap). Builds Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO) using a Minorization-Maximization (MM) scheme to guarantee monotonic likelihood improvement. Instantiates this framework as Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical algorithm.

Result: TRRO provides theoretical stability guarantees analogous to TRPO in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery and policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

Conclusion: The work delivers an IRL counterpart to TRPO, offering stable, principled reward learning with practical performance gains; PIRO stands as a robust, sample-efficient IRL algorithm for complex tasks.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

### [407] [Beyond Heuristics: Globally Optimal Configuration of Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23139)
*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR formulates INR configuration as a Bayesian optimization problem over a discrete set of activation families (SIREN, WIRE, FINER) and their continuous initialization parameters to maximize performance across signal-processing tasks, providing a unified, data-driven tuning framework for INRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs are powerful but their performance hinges on manual, ad-hoc choices for activations, initialization scales, and layer settings, causing instability and poor cross-task generalization. A principled, automated approach is lacking.

Method: Apply Bayesian optimization to jointly search discrete activation families and continuous initialization hyperparameters, across a joint space that captures interdependencies; compare performance across diverse tasks to identify globally optimal configurations.

Result: A unified optimization framework that yields globally optimal INR configurations, improving performance and consistency across modalities; demonstrates principled, data-driven design over ad-hoc tuning.

Conclusion: OptiINR provides a principled foundation for INR design, enabling robust, cross-task generalization; it can accommodate additional activations and hyperparameters and reduces manual tuning burden.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

### [408] [TimeExpert: Boosting Long Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Mix of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23145)
*Xiaowen Ma,Shuning Ge,Fan Yang,Xiangyu Li,Yun Chen,Mengting Ma,Wei Zhang,Zhipeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeExpert introduces Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), replacing vanilla attention with local K-V experts plus a global expert for time-series Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art long-term forecasting (TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G) on seven benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two real-world issues in time-series data: (1) lag effects where historical relevance varies over time, and (2) anomalous segments that inject noisy signals. Global self-attention is rigid and can overlook dynamic relevance patterns and noise.

Method: Replace standard attention with Temporal Mix of Experts: local K-V pairs act as specialized experts in distinct temporal contexts; adaptive expert selection per query via filtering of relevant timestamps; a shared global expert captures long-range dependencies. Implemented by substituting vanilla attention in PatchTST and Timer to yield TimeExpert (specific) and TimeExpert-G (general).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks show that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G surpass state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed local-expert plus global-expert attention framework effectively handles lag dynamics and anomalous segments in time-series forecasting, delivering improved accuracy without extra architectural changes; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mirror-Critique enhances verifier with informative critiques to improve RLVR solution verification, using ground-truth contrasts and synthetic critique data to outperform majority voting and enable abstention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward-model based verification in test-time scaling often relies on majority voting and fails to identify minority-correct answers due to a lack of informative critique signals during verifier training. Richer critique signals are needed to improve evaluation of candidate solutions.

Method: Train a verifier with informative critiques by contrasting model-generated solutions with ground-truth solutions. Use a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data via rejection sampling, teaching the verifier not only what is wrong, but why. Use the synthetic data to cold-start RLVR. Mirror-Verifier then generates multiple critiques per solution and aggregates them into a verify score for weighted voting or selective abstention.

Result: Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting in solution accuracy and improves the solver's honesty, enabling abstention from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Conclusion: Informative critique signals enable more reliable verification in RLVR; Mirror-Critique provides a practical approach to train verifiers with richer guidance, likely improving robustness and trust in LLM reasoning across tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

*Prashant Govindarajan,Mathieu Reymond,Antoine Clavaud,Mariano Phielipp,Santiago Miret,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CrystalGym, an open-source RL environment for discovering crystalline materials using direct DFT-derived rewards, and benchmarks RL algorithms to handle expensive, time-consuming feedback in material design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML in materials design relies heavily on costly DFT signals and mostly usesGenerative models without direct DFT feedback. There is a need for online reinforcement learning that can leverage direct DFT rewards to accelerate design.

Method: Introduce CrystalGym environment where properties such as band gap, bulk modulus, and density are computed via DFT as the reward signal. Benchmark multiple value- and policy-based RL algorithms on crystal design tasks conditioned on target properties. Include a case study on fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning to improve DFT-based rewards.

Result: Different RL algorithms show varying sample efficiency and convergence across tasks; no single method solves all CrystalGym tasks; ablations reveal the impact of environment settings on learning. The framework serves as a test bed for RL researchers and materials scientists to study time-consuming rewards.

Conclusion: CrystalGym provides a practical platform to study RL for real-world, DFT-driven materials design, highlighting challenges associated with expensive rewards and enabling interdisciplinary research at the intersection of ML and materials science.

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSTM-based cognitive impairment detection from daily passive sensing improves cross-participant generalizability via routine-aware augmentation and demographic personalization, boosting AUPRC from 0.637 to 0.766 in 6-month data from 36 older adults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cognitive decline is essential but hindered by sparse clinical assessments; passive smartphone sensing offers continuous, naturalistic monitoring, but cross-participant generalizability remains a key challenge.

Method: An LSTM model processes sequences of daily behavioral features derived from multimodal sensing. Two generalization techniques are proposed: (1) routine-aware augmentation to create synthetic sequences by replacing days with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic personalization to reweight training samples toward individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluation uses 6-month data from 36 older adults.

Result: With the two techniques, the model trained on sensing and demographic features achieved an AUPRC improvement from 0.637 (baseline) to 0.766, indicating improved detection performance.

Conclusion: Routine-aware augmentation and demographic personalization jointly enhance cross-participant generalizability of passive-sensing-based cognitive impairment detection, supporting scalable monitoring in aging populations.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTS introduces a hierarchical, prototype-based forecasting framework that achieves high accuracy while providing multi-level, expert-steerable interpretations of time-series forecasts by matching instances to denoised temporal prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretable forecasting models often offer only local, partial explanations and fail to reveal how heterogeneous input variables jointly shape the forecast over time, which is critical for trust in high-stakes settings.

Method: ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity using a denoised representation that preserves heterogeneous information. Prototypes are organized hierarchically into coarse global patterns and detailed local patterns, enabling global guidance and fine-grained explanations along with expert steering.

Result: Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show ProtoTS surpasses existing methods in forecast accuracy and provides expert-steerable interpretations for better decision support.

Conclusion: ProtoTS delivers both strong predictive performance and transparent, multi-level interpretability, making it suitable for trustworthy forecasting in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work generalizes dense associative memories (DAMs) from vectors to probability distributions under the 2-Wasserstein geometry, defining a log-sum-exp energy and Gibbs-weighted retrieval; it achieves exponential storage capacity and provides retrieval guarantees, validated on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks, thereby enabling distributional storage and memory-augmented learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAMs traditionally store fixed-point vectors in an energy landscape. Extending to distributions leverages richer representations and connects memory models to modern generative modeling and optimal transport (OT).

Method: Define a log-sum-exp energy over stored distributions; develop retrieval dynamics that aggregate optimal transport maps in a Gibbs-weighted manner; identify stationary points as self-consistent Wasserstein barycenters; specialize to Gaussian densities via the Bures-Wasserstein metric.

Result: Proves exponential storage capacity; provides quantitative retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations; validates the framework on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks.

Conclusion: This framework lifts associative memory from vector to distribution space, bridging classical DAMs with contemporary generative modeling and enabling robust distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

*Hangwei Zhang,Chun Kang,Yan Wang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) derived from Fourier Neural Operators. Finds LoRA underperforms adapters for LOMs; theoretically, stacked LoRA incurs depth-amplified error, while adapters preserve universal approximation and focus on low-frequency spectral components to reduce error. Introduces Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter) that allocates adapter capacity by spectral complexity, giving more capacity to low-frequency modes. F-Adapter achieves SOTA results on 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, improving generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT methods. First study of PEFT in scientific ML; F-Adapters offer an effective paradigm for PDE modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific machine learning deals with modeling complex physical systems and PDEs, often requiring large pre-trained models. PEFT offers parameter efficiency but its effectiveness in scientific ML is unexplored. The study seeks to adapt PEFT to Fourier-based operator models and to understand how spectral properties of PDE solutions influence fine-tuning strategies.

Method: Systematically compare LoRA and adapters on pre-trained Large Operator Models built from Fourier Neural Operator variants. Provide theoretical analysis showing depth-related lower bounds for LoRA in Fourier layers and universal approximation for adapters. Develop Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter) that allocates adapter capacity according to spectral frequency: higher dimensions for low-frequency components, lower for high-frequency ones. Evaluate on multiple 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, comparing against LoRA and other PEFT baselines.

Result: Adapters outperform LoRA on LOMs; LoRA exhibits depth-amplified approximation error. F-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, with better generalization and spectral fidelity. Theoretical analyses corroborate empirical observations, showing exponential decay of error with bottleneck width in Fourier domain for adapters. First evidence that PEFT can be effective for scientific ML and PDE modeling.

Conclusion: This work introduces PEFT to scientific ML and presents F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for PDE modeling, leveraging spectral sparsity to allocate resources where most needed. It establishes adapters as preferred PEFT for LOM-based scientific tasks and opens avenues for broader PEFT adoption in PDE solvers and physics-informed learning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

*Guohao Chen,Shuaicheng Niu,Deyu Chen,Jiahao Yang,Zitian Zhang,Mingkui Tan,Pengcheng Wu,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam is a simple asymmetric Siamese setup for test-time entropy minimization that prevents collapse and improves robustness across vision and language tasks with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address collapse and degenerate solutions in test-time entropy minimization, where minimizing entropy can inflate logit norms or favor a single dominant class, hindering generalization.

Method: Introduce ZeroSiam, an asymmetric Siamese architecture with a learnable predictor and a stop-gradient before the classifier to enforce asymmetric divergence alignment, preventing collapse while still leveraging self-predictions for adaptation.

Result: The approach yields empirical and theoretical evidence that collapse is avoided and biased learning signals are absorbed/regularized, improving performance even when no collapse occurs, with greater stability and minimal overhead across vision adaptation and large-language-model reasoning tasks, including tiny models.

Conclusion: ZeroSiam provides stable, collapse-resistant test-time entropy minimization with regularization benefits, enabling effective cross-domain adaptation with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

*Zhanhong Xie,Meifan Zhang,Lihua Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoSIFL introduces a two-stage Stackelberg FL framework with proactive alarming, local differential privacy, and an incentive scheme inspired by Tullock contests. It achieves unique server–client equilibrium, robust defenses against Byzantine and inference attacks, and reduced server costs with improved model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To secure federated learning against malicious/comprising clients and to incentivize high-quality data contribution under strict privacy constraints, bridging security, utility, and privacy in FL.

Method: An active alarming mechanism with robust aggregation defends against Byzantine and inference attacks, complemented by LDP for privacy and a Tullock-contest-inspired incentive module. The server first sets rewards, selects participants, and fixes global settings; clients then choose mini-batch sizes, noise scales, and alarm strategies. A two-stage game is analyzed with a proof of a unique equilibrium; effects of non-IID data and privacy budgets on efficiency are studied; empirical validation on standard benchmarks.

Result: CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reduces total server costs, demonstrating effective integration of security, privacy, and incentives; the model's efficiency is influenced by data heterogeneity and privacy budgets.

Conclusion: An integrated framework that simultaneously addresses security threats, privacy preservation, and incentive alignment in FL, showing promising performance and practical viability; invites further exploration into real-world heterogeneity and long-term dynamics.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

### [417] [Bridging the Gap Between Promise and Performance for Microscaling FP4 Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23202)
*Vage Egiazarian,Roberto L. Castro,Denis Kuznedelev,Andrei Panferov,Eldar Kurtic,Shubhra Pandit,Alexandre Marques,Mark Kurtz,Saleh Ashkboos,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study critically evaluates MXFP4 and NVFP4 for post-training quantization in LLMs, uncovering two main accuracy bottlenecks, and introduces MR-GPTQ—an FP4-aware GPTQ variant with block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations that deliver substantial speedups while improving accuracy, bringing MXFP4 closer to NVFP4. FP4 is not automatically better than INT4, but format-specific methods can unlock strong performance‑accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether hardware-accelerated FP4 formats (MXFP4, NVFP4) deliver real-world benefits for LLM inference and identify the gaps between promise and practice; motivate development of a quantization technique tailored to FP4’s unique properties.

Method: Introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a GPTQ variant tailored for FP4 using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. Develop high-performance GPU kernels that enable MR-GPTQ with negligible overhead via rotation fusion in weights and fast online computation of activations. Evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs (B200, RTX5090) against state-of-the-art baselines across FP16/INT4 baselines.

Result: MR-GPTQ achieves up to 3.6x layer-wise and 2.2x end-to-end speedups over FP16 on B200, and 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090. Empirically, MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms existing accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4 toward NVFP4—nearing its accuracy without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4; however, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock substantial accuracy-performance gains, making FP4 a viable option for efficient LLM inference when tailored to its characteristics.

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

### [418] [Towards Monotonic Improvement in In-Context Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23209)
*Wenhao Zhang,Shao Zhang,Xihuai Wang,Yang Li,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies Contextual Ambiguity in In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) and proposes Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL) to promote monotonic improvement. The paper provides theory, two estimators for Context Value, and empirical gains on Dark Room and Minigrid, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL aims to adapt rapidly using context without updating parameters, but observed testing-time performance often fails to monotonically improve despite monotone training data. The root cause is Contextual Ambiguity: the model’s own stochastic actions create histories that resemble suboptimal training histories, triggering a feedback loop of poor decisions. A principled signal is needed to align training and testing trajectories toward monotonic improvement.

Method: Introduce Context Value as an explicit signal representing the ideal performance given the current context. Prove that Context Value grows with context and tightens the lower bound on the performance gap to an ideal monotonically improving policy. Propose two methods to estimate Context Value at training and testing time and integrate CV into the ICRL objective (CV-ICRL).

Result: Theoretical result: Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap relative to an ideal monotone policy. Empirical result: CV-ICRL reduces performance degradation and improves ICRL performance across tasks/environments (Dark Room, Minigrid). Code and data are available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Contextual Ambiguity in ICRL can be mitigated by incorporating Context Value, yielding closer-to-monotonic improvements and stronger performance guarantees. CV-ICRL offers practical estimators and demonstrates broad effectiveness, with open-source implementation.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

*Hugo Math,Robin Schön,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSCAR offers scalable one-shot causal discovery for high-dimensional sparse event sequences by using two pretrained Transformers as density estimators to infer per-sequence Markov boundaries, enabling fast, parallel inference on large datasets (e.g., 29k events, 474 labels).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods do not scale to thousands of sparse event types; there is a need for scalable, interpretable causal structure learning in domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, and vehicle diagnostics.

Method: Two pretrained transformers act as density estimators within an autoregressive framework to infer per-sequence Markov boundaries; enables one-shot, parallel causal discovery without global conditional independence testing; scalable to large event alphabets.

Result: Applied to a real automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers interpretable causal structures in minutes; classical methods fail to scale, showing practical viability at production scale.

Conclusion: OSCAR enables scalable, interpretable causal discovery for large-scale event sequences, reducing reliance on costly CI tests and enabling practical diagnostics in real-world production settings.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event
types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle
diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot
causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using
two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient,
parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world
automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers
interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to
scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

*Xin Li,Mengbing Liu,Yiyang Zhu,Wenhe Zhang,Li Wei,Jiancheng An,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compact, domain-tuned LLMs with verifiable rewards (GRPO) reach near-GPT-4o performance on wireless math with far fewer parameters; training on WirelessMathBench-XL yields strong cross-domain math gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with specialized technical mathematics; a domain-specific RL framework that leverages verifiable correctness can unlock efficient, high-quality reasoning in niche domains such as wireless communications.

Method: Train 0.5B–7B models (WirelessMathLM) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards on WirelessMathBench-XL (4,027 problems from 970 papers); no supervised warm-start; benchmark built specifically for wireless math.

Result: 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL, close to GPT-4o at 40.4%; 7B uses ~100x fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%); GRPO yields +11% (0.5B), +103% (3B), +81% (7B) improvements; positive transfer to general math benchmarks (+8.4 points average on MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, AIME) without training on them.

Conclusion: Verifiable-correctness based RL enables compact domain-specific models to approach large-model performance on specialized math tasks and transfers gains to broader mathematics benchmarks; this approach reduces model size and resource needs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

### [421] [SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Speculative Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23232)
*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL uses speculative decoding to reuse prior rollout prefixes in RLVR, cutting rollout time by 2-3x without harming policy quality; broadly compatible with PPO, GRPO, DAPO and validated on math reasoning benchmarks; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models is bottlenecked by the costly rollout stage. Redundancy across consecutive epochs means rollouts share large overlapping segments, wasting computation. Existing accelerations either bias results or miss redundancy; a rollout-focused solution is needed.

Method: SPEC-RL integrates speculative decoding with the RL rollout process. It reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them with a draft-and-verify mechanism to maintain policy consistency. It is a rollout-stage enhancement that can be plugged into standard RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO).

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, etc.) shows 2-3x reduction in rollout time without compromising policy quality.

Conclusion: SPEC-RL offers a practical, general method to scale RLVR for large reasoning models by eliminating redundant rollout computation during training, with broad compatibility and available code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

### [422] [More Data or Better Algorithms: Latent Diffusion Augmentation for Deep Imbalanced Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23240)
*Shayan Alahyari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LatentDiff introduces a latent-space diffusion-based data-level augmentation for deep imbalanced regression, using priority-based generation to synthesize minority-region features, improving minority performance with little loss in overall accuracy across three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced regression, especially with high-dimensional, unstructured data, lags behind imbalanced classification. Existing data-level solutions largely target tabular data; there is a need for data-level augmentation in the latent space that works across modalities to improve minority predictions without sacrificing overall accuracy.

Method: LatentDiff uses conditional diffusion models operating in the latent representation space with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features for minority regions. The approach is modality-agnostic, computationally efficient, and applicable to images, text, and other high-dimensional inputs.

Result: Experiments on three deep imbalanced regression benchmarks show substantial improvements in minority-region predictions while maintaining overall regression accuracy.

Conclusion: LatentDiff provides a practical, scalable data-level solution for deep imbalanced regression by leveraging latent-space diffusion and priority-based generation, addressing a gap in high-dimensional data settings and enabling cross-modality applicability.

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

### [423] [Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246)
*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATDP is an adaptive DP-SGD variant that concentrates noise on gradients linked to sensitive tokens and increases noise early in training, achieving privacy protection faster with minimal impact on non-sensitive data performance; it can be integrated into existing pipelines and can substantially reduce DP fine-tuning time (~90% faster).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models frequently memorize sensitive information. Uniform noise in DP-SGD enlarges training time and degrades performance. There is a need for a privacy-preserving method that protects sensitive content efficiently while preserving non-sensitive accuracy.

Method: Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP) modifies vanilla DP-SGD by assigning different gradient weights to sensitive vs. non-sensitive tokens. It uses a larger noise scale early in training to rapidly disrupt memorization, followed by lightweight post-processing after standard fine-tuning. Noise is injected primarily into parameters associated with sensitive tokens. ATDP can be integrated into existing DP-based fine-tuning pipelines or applied to non-private models, and can be combined with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase to streamline DP pipelines.

Result: ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content, requiring only a few extra epochs of lightweight post-processing. It reduces DP fine-tuning training time by about 90% while achieving comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: ATDP offers a practical, efficient approach to privacy-preserving fine-tuning, preserving non-sensitive performance while providing strong protection for sensitive tokens. It is versatile, easy to integrate, and can complement redacted or standard DP pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

### [424] [Deep Learning for Subspace Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249)
*Vladimir Fanaskov,Vladislav Trifonov,Alexander Rudikov,Ekaterina Muravleva,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural-network-based regression approach to learn parametric subspaces for reduced-order models, using oversized subspaces to ease learning, with theoretical and empirical gains across parametric eigenproblems and PDE-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional parameter spaces make interpolation of parameter-dependent subspaces impractical; need efficient offline/online ROM that adapts to parameters.

Method: Formulate subspace selection as regression on Grassmann manifold; use neural network to map parameters to subspace; predict larger-than-needed subspaces; develop suitable loss functions for subspace data; analyze theoretical properties; offline training with sampled parameters; apply to various tasks.

Result: The approach reduces mapping complexity (theory for elliptic eigenproblems) and smoothness (Grassmann). Empirically, predicting larger subspaces improves accuracy; demonstrates usefulness for parametric eigenproblems, deflation, relaxation, optimal control, and parametric PDEs.

Conclusion: Subspace regression is a viable, versatile tool for parametric reduced-order modeling, enabling improved online performance and broad applicability.

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoFlux uses a competitive Attacker/Defender loop with a tool-augmented Judge to auto-generate targeted, multi-hop Q&A data (≤200 examples) that improves LLM reasoning with less data and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-efficient improvement of LLM reasoning by generating small, precisely targeted training data to enhance specific reasoning capabilities.

Method: Adversarial framework with Attacker/Defender dynamics, a tool-augmented Judge, embedding-based novelty filtering, and multi-hop explanations; fine-tune a 4B model on NanoFlux data.

Result: Outperforms full-benchmark fine-tuning on GSMHard (+5.9%), GenomeBench (+3.6%), and MultiMedQA (+16.6%), using <200 examples and achieving 3–14x computational savings.

Conclusion: Targeted small datasets can yield strong domain-specific gains; there is a non-monotonic relationship between dataset properties and performance; future work lies in smart data synthesis and tooling.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

*Zhang-Yu You,Jiahao Ma,Hongzong Li,Ye-Fan Hu,Jian-Dong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABCONFORMER uses a Conformer-based backbone with physics-inspired sliding attention to predict antibody–antigen interfaces from sequence alone, achieving state-of-the-art results on a SARS-CoV-2 dataset and enabling paratope/epitope as well as pan-epitope predictions without structural data; ablation shows the sliding attention improves precision; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting Ab–Ag interfaces from sequence alone is challenging yet crucial for vaccine design, diagnostics, and therapeutics because reliable 3D structures are costly or unavailable. The work aims to move beyond structure dependence by capturing local/global sequence features and residue-level contacts.

Method: Introduce ABCONFORMER with a Conformer backbone to capture local and global sequence features. Implement physics-inspired sliding attention to recover residue-level contacts without 3D structures. Predict paratopes and epitopes from antibody and antigen sequences, and pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information. Ablation studies compare sliding attention to conventional cross-attention to quantify contribution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab–Ag dataset; outperforms common sequence-based methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation confirms the contribution of sliding attention to improved epitope prediction precision.

Conclusion: Code will be released under an open-source license upon acceptance, facilitating reproducibility and enabling broader use in sequence-based Ab–Ag interface prediction and related applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

*Jiajun He,Paul Jeha,Peter Potaptchik,Leo Zhang,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Yuanqi Du,Saifuddin Syed,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A replica-exchange-based method (CREPE) for inference-time control of diffusion models that samples sequentially, preserves sample diversity after burn-in, and supports online refinement, achieving competitive results with SMC across tasks like temperature annealing, reward tilting, model composition, and debiasing classifier-free guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To steer diffusion-model outputs without retraining and without relying solely on heuristic guidance or SMC bias correction, while preserving sample diversity and enabling online refinement during generation.

Method: Adaptation of replica-exchange sampling for inference-time control of diffusion models (CREPE). Particles are generated sequentially, maintaining diversity even after burn-in, with support for online termination and refinement. Applied to temperature annealing, reward tilting, model composition, and classifier-free guidance debiasing.

Result: Demonstrates versatility and competitive performance relative to prior SMC methods across multiple control tasks, showing that CREPE can replace or supplement SMC in inference-time steering of diffusion models.

Conclusion: CREPE provides a flexible alternative to SMC for inference-time control of diffusion models, offering sequential particle generation, sustained diversity after burn-in, and online refinement/termination with broad applicability across control tasks.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: Transfer learning, de-novo Random Survival Forests (RSF), and ensemble integration can improve calibration and maintain discrimination for breast cancer survival prognostication, especially when using PREDICT v3-derived data is incomplete or when distribution shifts occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicopathological prognostication is cheaper and more accessible than genomic tools. ML, transfer learning, and ensembles offer opportunities to improve prognostication robustness and usability across settings.

Method: Train on MA.27 trial data; validate externally on TEAM and SEER. Apply transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained prognostic tool (PREDICT v3). Develop de-novo RSF and XGBoost-based prognostic models. Create an ensemble via weighted sum of predictions. Assess calibration (ICI) and discrimination (AUC); analyze SHAP for feature importance to identify key prognostic factors.

Result: Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration improved calibration (ICI from 0.042 to ≤0.007) with discrimination preserved or improved (AUC 0.738→0.744–0.799). PREDICT v3 had 23.8–25.8% invalid predictions due to missing data; ML approaches could predict survival regardless of missing information. SHAP highlighted age, nodal status, tumor grade, and tumor size as top contributors. External validation supported benefits in SEER (not TEAM).

Conclusion: Transfer learning and ML ensembles can enhance breast cancer prognostication when pre-trained model data are incomplete or when dataset shift is likely, with external validation showing context-dependent benefits.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

### [429] [Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning for Asset-Liability Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23280)
*Yilie Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-free continuous-time RL approach for Asset-Liability Management using a linear-quadratic formulation and a tailored Soft Actor-Critic, with adaptive actor exploration and scheduled critic exploration, achieving superior performance across 200 randomized market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asset-Liability Management requires dynamic synchronization of assets and liabilities; traditional methods often rely on model-based risk estimates or complex optimization. A model-free framework that directly learns the optimal ALM policy can potentially improve performance and robustness.

Method: Develop a policy-gradient based soft actor-critic algorithm tailored to ALM within a continuous-time, linear-quadratic setting. Introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for the critic to balance exploration/exploitation with minimal tuning. Evaluate against enhanced traditional strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and three state-of-the-art RL algorithms across 200 randomized market scenarios.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher average rewards than all baselines, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance across the 200 scenarios. The outperforming mechanism stems from directly learning the optimal ALM policy rather than learning the environment or relying on complex model estimation.

Conclusion: Directly learning the optimal ALM strategy via a model-free, continuous-time RL with LQ structure yields superior performance and robustness, without requiring sophisticated environment modeling or large neural architectures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Xavier Olive,Philippe Very*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NODE-FDM is a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations–based flight dynamics model trained on QAR data that fuses analytical kinematics with data-driven components to reproduce trajectories more accurately than BADA-based methods, notably in descent. Future work includes adding lateral dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. Existing models (e.g., BADA-based approaches) have limitations, especially in the descent phase and in capturing altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. A physics-informed neural ODE offers a data-driven yet physically grounded alternative.

Method: Propose NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations–based flight dynamics model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. The model combines analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components to create a hybrid, physics-informed representation of aircraft dynamics.

Result: The approach yields more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art models like BADA4, with notable improvements in altitude, speed, and mass dynamics, especially during descent. However, limitations include restricted physical constraints and limited availability of QAR data.

Conclusion: Physics-informed neural ODEs show promise as high-fidelity, data-driven aircraft performance models. Future work will extend the framework to model full lateral dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

### [431] [ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313)
*Xvyuan Liu,Xiangfei Qiu,Hanyin Cheng,Xingjian Wu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTGI is a framework for irregular multivariate time series forecasting that uses a learnable spatio-temporal embedding, adaptive nearest-neighbor causal graphs, dynamic message propagation, and query-point prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular sampling and asynchronous intervals in IMTS hinder effective representation and dependency modeling; existing methods struggle with data distortion and complex dependencies.

Method: 1) Spatio-Temporal Point Representation to embed observations; 2) Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction via nearest neighbors to form adaptive causal graphs; 3) Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation to update messages and interaction weights; 4) Query Point-based Prediction to forecast by aggregating neighborhood info for new query point and regression.

Result: Empirical results on multiple benchmarks show ASTGI outperforms various SOTA methods.

Conclusion: ASTGI effectively handles irregular multivariate time series forecasting with adaptive graphs and spatio-temporal propagation, improving accuracy.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

### [432] [Two-Scale Latent Dynamics for Recurrent-Depth Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23314)
*Francesco Pappone,Donato Crisostomi,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-scale dynamics in recurrent-depth transformers: small-scale refinements inside looped blocks and larger-scale drift across blocks. Loop updates shrink and become more orthogonal over time, suggesting improved local modeling of fine structure. Proposes an early-exit based on the second-order difference in step-size, which outperforms KL-divergence exit and first-order methods in performance, stability, and time-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometry of iterates in recurrent-depth transformers to inform efficient, stable late-stage inference and to develop principled exit criteria.

Method: Empirical analysis of latent iterates across looped blocks and checkpoints; measure step-size and directional changes (orthogonality) of updates; compare exit strategies—second-order difference-based exit vs KL-divergence exit (Geiping et al.) and naive first-order exits.

Result: Validation of a two-scale operational picture: within-block updates act as small refinements while across-block states drift at a larger scale; loop steps diminish in magnitude and become increasingly orthogonal over checkpoints. The second-order difference in step-size yields superior performance, stability, and time efficiency compared to KL-divergence exit and first-order exits.

Conclusion: The study supports a two-scale view of recurrent-depth transformers and introduces a second-order step-size-based early exit that improves efficiency and stability over prior exit strategies.

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

*Khang Tran,Hieu Cao,Thinh Pham,Nghiem Diep,Tri Cao,Binh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MELCOT is a hybrid matrix-valued regression model that combines Marginal Estimation to preserve spatial structure with a Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport block to capture global features, achieving superior efficiency and accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional regression with matrix-valued data where preserving spatial structure is important and computational efficiency is challenging.

Method: Hybrid MELCOT: ME block estimates data marginals to preserve spatial information; LCOT block learns global features; integrates classical and deep-learning components.

Result: Across diverse datasets, MELCOT outperforms all baselines and remains highly efficient.

Conclusion: Combining classical estimators with deep learning-based optimal transport yields robust performance; potential generalization to various matrix-valued regression tasks.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

### [434] [LLM Interpretability with Identifiable Temporal-Instantaneous Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23323)
*Xiangchen Song,Jiaqi Sun,Zijian Li,Yujia Zheng,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework for LLMs to capture both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations, bridging sparse autoencoders and causal representation learning with theoretical guarantees and scalable validation on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability with SAEs lacks temporal modeling and guarantees; CRL methods are theoretically appealing but do not scale to LLM-level complexity; there is a need for a scalable, identifiable framework that models both delayed and instantaneous causal relations to improve interpretability.

Method: Proposes an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework tailored for high-dimensional LLM concept spaces, capable of modeling both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relationships; extends SAE techniques by integrating temporal causal structure; provides theoretical identifiability guarantees; validated on synthetic datasets scaled to real-world complexity.

Result: The framework yields theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled for real-world complexity; discovers meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations, showing gains in interpretability by capturing both temporal and instantaneous relations.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships enhances LLM interpretability; the approach bridges SAEs and CRL, offering theoretical guarantees and practical scalability for analyzing LLM activations.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

*Jonas Ngnawé,Maxime Heuillet,Sabyasachi Sahoo,Yann Pequignot,Ola Ahmad,Audrey Durand,Frédéric Precioso,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-robust pretrained models, when fine-tuned with robust objectives, can suffer suboptimal transfer; introduces Epsilon-Scheduling and expected robustness to improve robustness-adaptation trade-offs across multiple models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of robust fine-tuning (RFT) with non-robust pretrained models. Robust objectives can hinder initial task adaptation, potentially causing transfer failures. A strategy and an evaluation metric are needed to assess and improve RFT performance.

Method: Systematic experiments on six pretrained models and five datasets to study RFT on non-robust models. Proposes Epsilon-Scheduling, a perturbation-strength schedule during training, and defines expected robustness as an aggregated metric across perturbations.

Result: Fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective can impede early adaptation and lead to suboptimal transfer; in difficult scenarios, transfer may fail. Epsilon-Scheduling prevents suboptimal transfer and consistently improves expected robustness across configurations.

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling is an effective heuristic to promote optimal transfer in robust fine-tuning of non-robust models, and expected robustness provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

*Xavier Aramayo Carrasco,Grigoriy Ksenofontov,Aleksei Leonov,Iaroslav Sergeevich Koshelev,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating Schrödinger bridge methods on discrete spaces is introduced, featuring analytically solvable SB instances and two new algorithms (DLightSB, DLightSB-M) plus an extension (alpha-CSBM). It enables rigorous, high-dimensional evaluation and aims to standardize reproducibility in SB research on discrete domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no reliable benchmark to assess how well Schrödinger bridge methods solve the entropic optimal transport problem on discrete spaces, hindering fair comparisons and reproducibility.

Method: Construct SB benchmark pairs with analytically known SB solutions; develop new algorithms DLightSB and DLightSB-M; extend prior work to alpha-CSBM; validate by evaluating existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings.

Result: The benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of SB methods on discrete spaces and demonstrates the utility of the proposed solvers; it also introduces the two new algorithms and the alpha-CSBM extension.

Conclusion: This work provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies and broader adoption of SB approaches in discrete domains.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

*Andrey Kharitenko,Zebang Shen,Riccardo de Santi,Niao He,Florian Doerfler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-score guided framework for implicit Riemannian optimization on data manifolds, introducing two inference-time algorithms (DLF and DRGD) with theoretical guarantees, demonstrated on data-driven control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data lie on low-dimensional manifolds, but classical manifold operations require explicit geometry. The data-manifold hypothesis and modern generative AI motivate optimizing directly over implicitly defined manifolds using distributional information (e.g., diffusion scores).

Method: Introduce a link function connecting the data distribution to required geometric operations (retraction and Riemannian gradient). Leverage the score function from diffusion models and pretrained score networks. Propose two algorithms for inference-time optimization: Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD). Provide theoretical guarantees for feasibility (approximate manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm).

Result: Derives conditions under which the manifold operations can be recovered via the link function and score information; proves feasibility and optimality guarantees for DLF and DRGD; demonstrates effectiveness on finite-horizon reference tracking tasks in data-driven control.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient, data-driven optimization on implicitly defined manifolds by leveraging diffusion-score information, connecting generative modeling with practical optimization, and showcasing potential for generative and design applications in AI-driven tasks.

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

### [438] [Emergence of Superposition: Unveiling the Training Dynamics of Chain of Continuous Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23365)
*Hanlin Zhu,Shibo Hao,Zhiting Hu,Jiantao Jiao,Stuart Russell,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-layer transformer with continuous chain-of-thought (CoT) develops a superposition of reasoning traces during training. The training dynamics show the index-matching logit grows and becomes bounded, enabling a balance between local search and exploration of multiple traces, which yields superposition. Experimental tracking of logits corroborates the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the mechanism for superposing multiple reasoning traces in continuous CoT emerges from gradient-based training, particularly for directed graph reachability.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on directed graph reachability. The analysis identifies two training stages: (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. It focuses on the behavior of the index-matching logit and how it evolves under training.

Result: Under mild assumptions, the index-matching logit increases initially and then remains bounded. This boundedness creates a balance between exploiting local problem structure and exploring multiple plausible traces, enabling the model to assign comparable weights to several traces and thereby realize a superposition of reasoning paths. Experimental results tracking logits support the theoretical claims.

Conclusion: Continuous thought training yields a bounded index-matching logit that fosters exploration–exploitation balance and superposition of reasoning traces in a two-layer transformer for directed graph reachability; theory aligns with empirical observations.

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

### [439] [Splines-Based Feature Importance in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Framework for Supervised Tabular Data Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23366)
*Ange-Clément Akazan,Verlon Roel Mbingui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-based feature selectors use spline-parameterized Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to learn interpretable feature importances for tabular data, achieving competitive or superior results to classical baselines and capturing nonlinear multivariate interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional tabular datasets require effective feature selection to improve predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. Many traditional methods rely on sparsity or simple correlations and may miss nonlinear/multivariate interactions. KANs provide a framework to learn feature transformations with interpretable importance measures.

Method: Propose four KAN-based selectors (KAN-L1, KAN-L2, KAN-SI, KAN-KO) and compare them against standard baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) on classification and regression tabular benchmarks. Evaluate across three retention levels (20%, 40%, 60%) using average F1 (classification) and R^2 (regression). Analyze performance in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, redundancy removal, and interpretability of feature importance.

Result: KAN-based selectors are competitive with or superior to classical baselines on structured and synthetic datasets. KAN-L2, KAN-L1, KAN-SI, and KAN-KO show strong performance, with KAN-L1 often too aggressive in regression (removing useful features) and KAN-L2 underperforming in classification due to simple coefficient shrinkage missing complex interactions. KAN-L2 and KAN-SI are robust on noisy regression and heterogeneous data; in classification, KAN-L1, KAN-KO, and KAN-SI may outperform by removing redundancy in high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, KAN-based feature selection offers interpretable, nonlinearity-aware feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based methods.

Conclusion: KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative to traditional methods for tabular data, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures; performance depends on the task and selection strategy, with certain KAN selectors excelling in specific settings.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR) injects relational graphs derived from model predictions into training via parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers to align feature similarity with class-aware prediction structure, improving semantic feature quality without changing architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks often learn rich representations that include noisy inter-class similarities conflicting with predicted semantics. A semantic regularizer that enforces consistency between feature relationships and class-level predictions can improve the quality and usefulness of learned features.

Method: Introduce parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL constructs a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph (derived by modulating softmax similarities with intra-class indicators). Employ a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. The approach is model-agnostic, lightweight, and requires no architectural or training procedure changes.

Result: Empirically, GCR yields cleaner feature structures, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization across various networks and datasets.

Conclusion: GCR offers a new perspective on learning from prediction structure by using self-prompted, graph-based semantic regularization to refine representations without modifying network architecture.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

### [441] [Planner Aware Path Learning in Diffusion Language Models Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23405)
*Fred Zhangzhi Peng,Zachary Bezemek,Jarrid Rector-Brooks,Shuibai Zhang,Anru R. Zhang,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aligns training with planner-based inference by deriving P-ELBO and Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), improving diffusion-language-model performance across protein, text, and code domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models trained with uniform random denoising paths mismatch the planner-based reverse dynamics used at inference; this mismatch harms performance.

Method: Derive Planned ELBO (P-ELBO) that incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective; propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss to align training with planned denoising paths.

Result: Empirical improvements across domains: ~40% relative gain in protein sequence modeling; up to 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation; ~23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Conclusion: Accounting for planner-based reverse dynamics in training reduces mismatches between training and inference, yielding consistent, cross-domain gains with PAPL.

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-layer transformer framework for multiplex link prediction with two instantiations, Trans-SLE and Trans-GAT, emphasizing inter-layer dependencies, scalability, and leakage-free evaluation; achieves macro-F1 gains on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiplex graphs encode multiple relation types among shared nodes. Traditional approaches either collapse layers or treat them independently, which loses cross-layer dependencies and raises scalability concerns. A scalable, fair, multi-view approach is needed for reliable multiplex link prediction.

Method: For each node pair, build a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. Two instantiations: Trans-SLE (lightweight transformer over static embeddings) and Trans-GAT (layer-specific GAT encoders with transformer fusion). Introduces a Union–Set candidate pool and leakage-free protocols (cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization) to ensure scalability and fair evaluation. Compatible with both precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Result: Experiments on six public multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F1 gains over strong baselines (MELL, HOPLP-MUL, RMNE).

Conclusion: The approach is simple, scalable, and capable of leveraging inter-layer dependencies for multiplex link prediction, with broad compatibility for embeddings and GNNs and fair leakage-free evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

### [443] [PATCH: Learnable Tile-level Hybrid Sparsity for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23410)
*Younes Hourri,Mohammad Mozaffari,Maryam Mehri Dehnavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH enables a hybrid, tile-based sparsity framework that supports a continuous sparsity ratio from 0% to 50% by selectively marking tiles as either dense or 2:4 sparse. This yields hardware-friendly acceleration with non-uniform sparsity across layers and improved accuracy over prior 2:4 pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce memory and compute costs of large language models while preserving accuracy. Unstructured sparsity hurts GPU acceleration due to irregular access patterns, and rigid 2:4 sparsity degrades quality. A flexible, tile-level hybrid sparsity seeks a better accuracy-acceleration balance.

Method: Partition weight matrices into tiles and apply a learnable mask to choose per-tile dense or 2:4 sparse representation. Allows a continuous sparsity ratio (0-50%) and non-uniform sparsity across layers for fine-grained control and hardware-friendly acceleration.

Result: Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH narrows the gap to dense accuracy while providing practical speedups. On LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup and improves accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% over the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.

Conclusion: PATCH offers a flexible, hardware-friendly hybrid sparsity solution that bridges the gap between unstructured and structured (2:4) pruning, enabling fine-grained accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and non-uniform sparsity across layers with consistent gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

### [444] [URS: A Unified Neural Routing Solver for Cross-Problem Zero-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23413)
*Changliang Zhou,Canhong Yu,Shunyu Yao,Xi Lin,Zhenkun Wang,Yu Zhou,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: URS is a single-model neural solver that achieves zero-shot generalization across 100+ VRP variants using unified data representation, a mixed bias module, a parameter generator, and LLM-driven constraint satisfaction, without any fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome zero-shot generalization limitations of existing neural VRP solvers that rely on fixed constraints or per-problem fine-tuning, hindering applicability to unseen VRP variants.

Method: Proposes URS: Unified Data Representation (UDR) to unify problem inputs; Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to learn geometric/relational biases; a parameter generator to adapt decoder weights and MBM biases for new variants; an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction system translating problem descriptions into executable masking steps.

Result: Empirical results show URS delivers high-quality solutions for over 100 VRP variants with no fine-tuning, including more than 90 unseen variants, making it the first neural VRP solver to cover such breadth with a single model.

Conclusion: URS broadens zero-shot generalization in neural VRP solvers through data unification, bias-aware architecture, adaptive parameter generation, and LLM-guided feasibility, reducing reliance on domain expertise and enabling versatile, scalable VRP solving.

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

### [445] [LOTFormer: Doubly-Stochastic Linear Attention via Low-Rank Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23436)
*Ashkan Shahbazi,Chayne Thrash,Yikun Bai,Keaton Hamm,Navid NaderiAlizadeh,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer provides a linear-time, doubly-stochastic attention by reframing attention as entropic optimal transport with a learnable pivot, achieving O(nr) complexity and improved performance on long-range tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic softmax attention is expensive and can over-emphasize a few tokens; most attention maps are row-normalized and lack robust token participation across both rows and columns. There is a need for scalable, robust attention that also balances participation.

Method: Formulate attention as two entropic OT problems: queries→pivot and pivot→keys; compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. Constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Learn pivot locations and masses end-to-end. Compute attention in O(nr) time without forming the full n×n map; rank is at most r<<n.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: LOTFormer delivers a principled, scalable attention mechanism that is doubly-stochastic and low-rank, enabling robust and efficient long-context modeling without incurring full quadratic cost.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

### [446] [Better Hessians Matter: Studying the Impact of Curvature Approximations in Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23437)
*Steve Hong,Runa Eschenhagen,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In influence-function data attribution for deep nets, higher-fidelity Hessian approximations consistently yield more accurate attribution scores. Among approximations, a mismatch between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues explains the majority of errors, guiding which steps to prioritize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence functions aim to trace a model's predictions back to training data, but their practical use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert large, ill-conditioned Hessians. While approximations like GGN and K-FAC exist to make computations tractable, it is unclear how the quality of these approximations affects attribution performance.

Method: The authors conduct controlled classification experiments comparing various Hessian-approximation methods (e.g., GGN, EK-FAC, K-FAC). They decompose each approximation into constituent steps and evaluate each step's impact on attribution accuracy, including an analysis of eigenvalue spectra to identify the source of errors.

Result: Better Hessian approximations yield consistently higher-quality influence scores. Decomposing the methods reveals that the dominant error arises from the mismatch between K-FAC eigenvalues and the true/Hessian-like eigenvalues (GGN/EK-FAC), with other approximation steps contributing less to attribution loss.

Conclusion: Prioritize improving Hessian eigenstructure alignment with the true curvature when designing tractable influence-function computations; focus on steps that affect eigenvalue alignment to balance computational tractability with attribution accuracy.

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

*Wenhao Yang,Lin Li,Xiaohui Tao,Kaize Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-aware data-removal method for training deep models that decorrelates factors and perturbs loss to maintain performance under distribution shifts, including OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and data protection require removing sensitive data, which can induce distributional shifts and degrade performance, especially out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.

Method: Two components: (1) discriminative-preserving factor decorrelation module with dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and inter-feature correlations; (2) smoothed data removal with loss perturbation to create information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal operations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows the proposed method outperforms baselines, delivering high predictive accuracy and robustness under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution shifts, with claimed efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The approach provides effective privacy-preserving data removal that preserves discriminative power, mitigates distribution shift, and maintains robustness, with practical potential for deployment under regulatory data-removal requirements.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE is a modular physics-informed ML framework that accelerates scientific simulations by enforcing multi-level physical constraints and heterogeneity-aware encoders, achieving ~60x reduction in required integration time for E3SM Land Model biogeochemical spin-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale numerical simulations are computationally expensive and AI surrogates struggle with physical plausibility, trust, and integrating heterogeneous data. A trustworthy, data-fusion capable surrogate is needed for mission-critical scientific workflows.

Method: PHASE uses data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs and multi-level physics-based constraints to enforce consistency from local dynamics to global behavior; includes a data-fusion pipeline enabling heterogeneous data integration and generalizes to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning.

Result: Applied to the BGC spin-up workflow of E3SM Land Model; with only the first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that would otherwise require >1,200 years of integration, achieving at least a 60x reduction in integration length; demonstrates scientifically validated AI acceleration and strong generalization.

Conclusion: PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather than surface correlations, enabling physically consistent acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evolved Sampling (ES) is a dynamic data-sampling framework that selects informative batches based on loss dynamics and loss differences to accelerate training with minimal or no loss in performance; extended to ESWP for set-level pruning, achieving up to ~45% wall-clock time savings across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce training time while preserving model performance by focusing on informative data through dynamic batch-level sampling, addressing data efficiency in large-scale ML.

Method: Dynamic batch-level data selection guided by the dynamics of training losses and augmented loss differences, with flexible frequency tuning. ES can be extended to set-level data selection (ESWP) with pruning. It is a plug-and-play framework for lossless training accelerations.

Result: Consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45% of wall-clock time.

Conclusion: ES presents a concise, extensible approach to data-efficient learning, motivating further research into dynamic data selection for large-scale ML.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

*Alakh Sharma,Gaurish Trivedi,Kartikey Bhandari,Yash Sinha,Dhruv Kumar,Pratik Narang,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEMS is a surrogate-free, scalable MARL framework that replaces explicit policy populations with latent anchors and a single amortized generator, enabling faster, more memory-efficient learning with higher rewards than PSRO while preserving game-theoretic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSRO and similar population-based MARL methods require storing explicit policy populations and constructing payoff matrices, leading to quadratic computation and linear memory costs. This hinders scalability. There is a need for a memory-efficient, scalable alternative that retains theoretical guarantees.

Method: GEMS replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and one amortized generator. It avoids building payoff matrices by using unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained inside the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, so there is no separate actor training or population storage.

Result: Empirical evaluation across two-player and multi-player games (Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker, Multi-Particle environment) shows GEMS is up to ~6x faster and uses ~1.3x less memory than PSRO, while achieving higher rewards.

Conclusion: GEMS retains the game-theoretic guarantees of PSRO while overcoming its inefficiencies, enabling scalable multi-agent learning across multiple domains.

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

*Rui Ai,Hugo De Oliveira Barbalho,Sirui Li,Alexei Robsky,David Simchi-Levi,Ishai Menache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework named POC (Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection) guides when to re-solve MILPs in real-time operations. It uses PPO plus change-point detection to balance solution quality and re-solving cost, addressing non-MDP, high-horizon settings; shows 2-17% improvement over baselines on eight datasets and introduces real-time MILP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-time operations, deciding whether to re-solve computationally expensive MILPs is economically critical. High-frequency data collection clashes with costly optimization; challenges include characterizing optimality and cost, detecting environmental changes, sample selection, and the non-MDP, long-horizon nature unsuitable for vanilla RL; current literature relies on heuristics and smooth objectives.

Method: Propose POC: a framework that integrates change-point detection with Proximal Policy Optimization to decide re-solve times. Theoretical linkage between number of re-solves and re-solving cost. Empirically validated on eight synthetic/real datasets; includes new real-time MILP benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

Result: POC consistently outperforms baselines by 2-17% across eight datasets; demonstrates practical utility and contributes benchmarks.

Conclusion: POC provides a principled approach to balancing performance and cost in re-solving real-time MILPs, addressing a gap in literature and enabling real-time MILP benchmarking; potential for broader applicability in NP-hard optimization settings.

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter is a lightweight, learnable transform that maps new embeddings into the old space to avoid full re-embedding/reindexing after model upgrades, preserving ~95–99% of retrieval quality with minimal latency and substantial recompute savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize operational disruption and computational cost when upgrading embedding models in production vector databases by sidestepping full corpus re-encoding and ANN index rebuilds.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three adapter variants—Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and compact Residual MLP—trained on paired old/new embeddings; experiments on MTEB text corpora and a 1M-item CLIP image upgrade to assess recall, latency, robustness, and scalability.

Result: Drift-Adapter recovers 95–99% of full re-embedding recall (Recall@10, MRR), with <10 microseconds additional per-query latency; recompute costs reduced by >100x versus full re-indexing or dual-index approaches; robust to drift and scalable to large item sets.

Conclusion: A pragmatic, near-zero-interruption upgrade mechanism that integrates with existing ANN indices; suitable for agile deployments and scalable to billion-item systems, with design choices (e.g., diagonal scaling) affecting performance.

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

*Jiang-Xin Shi,Wen-Da Wei,Jin-Fei Qi,Xuanyu Chen,Tong Wei,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAct proposes memory-efficient fine-tuning via online low-rank activation compression, reducing activation memory by ~80% over LoRA with competitive performance, and without calibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation memory is a major bottleneck in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, especially with large batch sizes and long contexts; activations exhibit low rank, suggesting a low-rank compression strategy.

Method: Introduce Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct) that compresses activations online during the forward pass without calibration data, and a sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm for low-rank matrices offering faster computation and tighter error bounds than RSVD.

Result: Experiments on vision and language tasks show significant activation-memory reduction (~80% vs LoRA) while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: LoRAct provides a flexible, online, calibration-free low-rank activation compression approach that substantially reduces activation memory without sacrificing performance; source code is available.

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

### [454] [Statistical Learning Guarantees for Group-Invariant Barron Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23474)
*Yahong Yang,Wei Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Group invariance in neural networks can improve generalization in the Barron framework via a group-dependent factor delta <= 1 in the approximation rate; when delta is small (e.g., ~|G|^{-1}), invariance yields substantial gains, while estimation error remains unaffected by symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously quantify how incorporating group symmetries into neural networks affects approximation and estimation errors within the Barron framework, and to identify regimes where symmetry yields statistical advantages.

Method: Theoretical analysis within the Barron framework deriving a group-dependent delta factor in the approximation rate; proving the Rademacher complexity of the invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant class; and presenting illustrative examples for delta ~ |G|^{-1} and delta ~ 1.

Result: Key results: (1) Approximation error scales with delta, so small delta yields substantial improvements; (2) Estimation error is unaffected by symmetry since Rademacher complexity does not increase; (3) Generalization can improve when target functions possess group symmetries; (4) Examples show both favorable and unfavorable regimes depending on delta.

Conclusion: Encoding group-invariant structures in neural networks provides a rigorous theoretical basis for statistical advantages in symmetric settings, with gains determined by the group-dependent delta; practical gains depend on the symmetry strength of the target function.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

*Divyam Madaan,Sumit Chopra,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigates interpolation and extrapolation in parameter space for generalization under distribution shifts; finds no method consistently beating using the latest parameters; emphasizes limitations and need for future data or assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether models can generalize to future data using only past observations when distributions shift, and under what conditions extrapolation in parameter space might help.

Method: Benchmarks of parameter interpolation (convex combinations of past model parameters) and parameter extrapolation (extrapolating beyond the convex hull of past parameters) across diverse temporal tasks: language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite land-use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction.

Result: Across tasks, none of the methods consistently outperformed the simple baseline of using the most recent model parameters.

Conclusion: Without access to future data or robust assumptions about the data-generating process, generalization and extrapolation to future data are inherently challenging; findings urge caution in claiming generalization under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

### [456] [Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494)
*Jie Yang,Yifan Hu,Kexin Zhang,Luyang Niu,Yushun Dong,Philip S. Yu,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CRIB to forecast directly from incomplete multivariate time series, avoiding imputation, with strong performance under high missingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imputation-based forecasting assumes missing values can be accurately filled, but there is no ground-truth for missing data; imputation can distort data distributions and degrade predictive accuracy, necessitating methods that operate on partially observed data.

Method: Introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB) built on the Information Bottleneck principle. It uses a unified-variate attention mechanism and a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations from partially observed sequences that suppress noise from missing values while preserving predictive signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate CRIB’s effectiveness, achieving accurate predictions even with high missing rates; the authors release their code on GitHub.

Conclusion: Shifts the paradigm from imputation-then-prediction to direct prediction on partial data; CRIB provides a robust mechanism for MTSF-M and illustrates the viability of information-bottleneck-based approaches for handling missing data.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

### [457] [Beyond Outliers: A Study of Optimizers Under Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23500)
*Georgios Vlassis,Saleh Ashkboos,Alexandra Volkova,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study of how optimizer choice affects model robustness under post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) across large models; standard outlier metrics (MMR, Kurtosis) fail to predict PTQ degradation; Shampoo offers the best robustness under QAT and highest parameter efficiency; optimizer choice matters for quantization outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As optimizers update and quantization becomes standard for efficient deployment, there is a need for systematic evidence on optimizer–quantization interactions to guide training and deployment strategies.

Method: Train FP models (50M–1.5B params) using six optimizers to map hyperparameter landscapes; apply PTQ to assess degradation across optimizers; analytically explain why MMR fails; train quantized models from scratch (QAT) and compare to FP baselines; derive scaling laws for QAT under different optimizers; identify Shampoo as least degraded and most parameter-efficient.

Result: MMR and Kurtosis do not reliably predict PTQ performance across optimizers due to ignoring error propagation through the network; QAT degradation depends on optimizer, with some optimizers (Shampoo) showing the least accuracy loss and best scaling/parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice materially affects quantization robustness; PTQ and QAT evaluations should consider optimizer selection; Shampoo is particularly favorable for QAT in terms of degradation and efficiency; standard outlier metrics are insufficient predictors of PTQ outcomes.

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

### [458] [Disentanglement of Variations with Multimodal Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23548)
*Yijie Zhang,Yiyang Shen,Weiran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDMVAE introduces an information-disentangled multimodal VAE that uses cross-view mutual information to extract shared factors, a cycle-consistency style loss with generative augmentations to remove redundancy, and diffusion priors to strengthen latent modeling, yielding clearer shared/private separation and improved generation and semantic coherence on hard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal data are heterogeneous and highly interconnected; disentangling shared (cross-modal) information from private (modality-specific) information is challenging, especially when the likelihood model is insufficient for robust disentanglement.

Method: Propose IDMVAE with explicit shared and private latent spaces. Apply cross-view mutual information maximization to capture shared variables. Use a cycle-consistency style loss with generative augmentations to reduce redundancy in private factors. Incorporate diffusion models to enhance the capacity of latent priors. The components are complementary.

Result: Experiments show a clean separation between shared and private information, with superior generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: IDMVAE provides a robust framework for information-disentangled multimodal modeling. The combination of MI-based regularizations and diffusion priors improves disentanglement and downstream performance, with broad applicability to multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

### [459] [Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23552)
*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Nowshin Tarannum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight AMR-EnsembleNet uses a 1D CNN to learn SNP sequence motifs and fuses it with XGBoost, achieving strong AMR prediction on 809 E. coli strains across four antibiotics, with high MCC and Macro F1 and focus on known AMR genes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMR is a rising global health crisis. Genomic sequencing enables rapid resistance prediction, but standard ML treats genomes as unordered features; Transformers are data- and compute-heavy for moderate datasets. There is a need for efficient models that leverage SNP sequential context and non-local interactions.

Method: Propose AMR-EnsembleNet: a lightweight 1D CNN to extract predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data, ensembled with an XGBoost model. Trained on 809 E. coli strains across four antibiotics with class imbalance. Evaluation uses MCC and Macro F1; analysis shows SNP focus in known AMR genes (e.g., fusA, parC).

Result: The 1D CNN–XGBoost ensemble achieved top-tier performance across all antibiotics, e.g., MCC 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Macro F1 0.691 for Gentamicin (GEN). The model consistently highlights SNPs within well-known AMR genes, indicating it learns relevant genetic signals.

Conclusion: Ensembling a sequence-aware CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model effectively overcomes the limitations of order-agnostic or standalone sequence models, offering a performant and interpretable approach for AMR prediction on moderately-sized datasets.

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

*Ruiqi Lyu,Alistair Turcan,Martin Jinye Zhang,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaCD uses high-confidence seeds from CI tests and LLM annotations, filters LLM hallucinations via shuffled queries, and propagates edge directions with a confidence-down strategy, improving accuracy over traditional constraint-based methods and compatible with skeleton-based discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CI-based causal discovery assumes perfect CI tests and exhaustive search; real data breach assumptions leading to cascading errors. LLMs offer supplementary guidance but are prone to hallucinations; need robust seed selection and propagation.

Method: Combine seeds from CI tests and LLMs; apply shuffled queries to resist positional bias and filter hallucinations; apply confidence-down propagation to orient edges from the most reliable seeds; integrate with any skeleton-based method.

Result: On multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher final-graph accuracy than existing constraint-based methods due to improved seed reliability and robust propagation.

Conclusion: MosaCD provides a robust, plug-in approach for causal discovery from observational data by leveraging mixed evidence sources and a principled seed propagation strategy, adaptable to various skeleton-based algorithms.

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

TL;DR: EVO-LRP uses CMA-ES to optimize LRP hyperparameters for improved interpretability metrics, achieving better metric scores and visual coherence than standard XAI methods, with class-specific feature sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI tools trade detail for interpretability and LRP's heuristic rules are not optimized for clarity; we need principled, data-driven optimization to align attributions with model behavior.

Method: Apply Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to search hyperparameters of LRP, optimizing against quantitative metrics like faithfulness and sparseness; evaluate on models/datasets and compare to traditional XAI methods.

Result: EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in interpretability metrics and visual coherence; attribution is highly sensitive to class-specific features.

Conclusion: Systematic, task-specific optimization can substantially improve attribution quality for LRP-based explanations.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD jointly recovers low-rank and diagonal components of Low-Rank plus Diagonal (LoRD) operators from few matrix-vector products, via a convex optimization formulation. It outperforms sequential diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal methods and offers scalable, high-fidelity approximations for large-scale operators like deep learning Hessians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional linear operators are often only accessible through costly matrix-vector products. Existing sketching methods typically yield either a low-rank or a diagonal approximation, which can incur substantial errors. A joint low-rankplus-diagonal model promises higher fidelity while remaining scalable.

Method: Propose SKETCHLORD that jointly estimates both low-rank and diagonal components of LoRD operators. Cast the problem as a convex optimization with a scalable algorithm. The approach is designed to be superior to any sequential diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal strategy. Validate theoretically and empirically on synthetic LoRD matrices.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show that joint estimation outperforms sequential variants in recovering LoRD structure. On synthetic LoRD matrices, SKETCHLORD accurately recovers both the low-rank and diagonal components and scales to large problems, including operators akin to deep learning Hessians.

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD broadens the structured-approximation toolkit by providing a principled, scalable method to approximate LoRD operators with higher fidelity than prior sequential methods, making it particularly valuable for large-scale operators where high-fidelity Hessian-like approximations are desired.

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

### [463] [Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592)
*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-stage continual model merging framework that uses tangent-space fine-tuning, optimizer-state informed merging, and post-merge representation alignment to enable scalable continual learning with constant memory, avoiding access to old data while mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core problem is catastrophic forgetting in continual learning under storage/compute constraints. Traditional methods either accumulate many per-task vectors (scalability issues) or rely on weight-space merging without old data (loss of functional information). There is a need for a scalable approach that preserves functional information and memory efficiency.

Method: Pre-merging: fine-tune the base model within its tangent space on domain-specific data to linearize representations and disentangle task-specific weights. During merging: utilize functional information from optimizer states (beyond simple parameter averages) to inform merging without revisiting old data. Post-merging: apply a correction to align representations between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias. The approach operates under constant memory constraints and does not require historic data.

Result: Empirical evaluation on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks shows competitive performance and improved scalability, indicating the method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting under memory constraints.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, memory-efficient solution to continual model merging that preserves functional information and achieves competitive results, addressing core forgetting challenges in continual learning.

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

### [464] [Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593)
*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rank-1 Fisher for diffusion models enables an efficient EWC penalty that complements replay, improving continual learning in class-incremental generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning. Replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) have limitations (replay requires a strong generator and suffers distributional drift; EWC assumes a shared optimum and often uses a diagonal Fisher). The paper investigates diffusion models as replay engines and analyzes gradient geometry to derive a computationally cheap yet effective regularizer.

Method: The authors study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, showing that in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. They propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that matches diagonal-cost in computation but captures the dominant curvature direction. This penalty is paired with replay to encourage parameter sharing while mitigating drift. Experiments on class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k) compare against replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines.

Result: The method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. Forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST and roughly halved on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: Diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. A better Fisher estimate makes EWC a strong complement to replay: replay promotes parameter sharing across tasks while EWC constrains drift induced by replay.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

TL;DR: A systematic study shows linear time-series models can be robust and competitive when analyzed through characteristic roots; introduces two regularization strategies—Reduced-Rank Regression variants and Root Purge—to suppress noise-induced spurious roots, achieving strong benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of complex forecasting models, simple linear models exhibit robustness and interpretability. The paper seeks to understand their dynamics via characteristic roots and to improve data efficiency under noise.

Method: The authors first analyze the noise-free regime, showing characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and that design choices like instance normalization and channel independence influence capabilities. They extend to the noisy regime, where models may produce spurious roots and sampling indicates a data-scaling requirement for mitigating noise. To address this, they propose two complementary strategies: (1) rank-reduction techniques (Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction) to recover low-dimensional latent dynamics, and (2) Root Purge, an adaptive method that learns a noise-suppressing null space during training. They validate these approaches with extensive experiments on standard benchmarks.

Result: The proposed methods improve robustness and achieve state-of-the-art results in several settings, with empirical validation supporting the theoretical insights and demonstrating data-efficient performance.

Conclusion: Integrating classical linear-system theory with modern learning yields robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models. The root-based perspective offers practical design guidance and highlights the value of structural regularization to combat noise.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

*Fanlong Zeng,Wensheng Gan,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphIFE tackles graph class imbalance by invariant feature extraction to address quality inconsistencies in synthesized nodes, improving minority-class performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in graphs degrades GNN performance; synthesized nodes often suffer quality inconsistencies, hindering the learning of minority classes.

Method: Propose GraphIFE, a Graph Invariant Feature Extraction framework that leverages graph invariant learning to strengthen the embedding space and identify invariant features, mitigating quality issues of synthesized nodes under imbalance.

Result: Empirical experiments show GraphIFE outperforms strong baselines across multiple datasets, demonstrating efficiency and robust generalization; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: GraphIFE offers a principled approach to graph imbalance via invariant feature extraction, improving minority-class performance and generalization in GNNs.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

*Chen Yang,Changhao Zhao,Chen Wang,Jiansheng Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a 3x3 train/validation/test partition to eliminate leakage in inductive kriging and introduces DRIK, a distribution-robust method that perturbs nodes, drops edges, and uses pseudo-labeled subgraphs to improve OOD generalization; reports up to 12.48% MAE improvement across six datasets with good scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 2x2 spatio-temporal splits leak information into model selection, masking true OOD behavior in inductive kriging; a clean evaluation protocol is needed and a method that explicitly targets OOD generalization.

Method: Define a 3x3 partition separating training, validation, and test sets; propose DRIK with node-coordinate perturbations, edge dropping, and pseudo-labeled subgraphs across node, edge, and subgraph levels to capture spatial relationships and diversify information flow, optimizing for distribution robustness.

Result: DRIK consistently outperforms existing methods with up to 12.48% lower MAE on six diverse spatio-temporal datasets while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: A 3x3 partition removes leakage and yields more realistic OOD evaluation; DRIK provides a robust inductive kriging framework with improved generalization in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

*Owen Lewis Howell,Linfeng Zhao,Xupeng Zhu,Yaoyao Qian,Haojie Huang,Lingfeng Sun,Wil Thomason,Robert Platt,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, enabling efficient global, high-order equivariant attention via Clebsch-Gordan convolution on SO(3) irreps with O(N log N) token complexity; includes sparsity-based scaling and optional token permutation equivariance, achieving GPU memory, speed, and accuracy gains on diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current equivariant transformers are limited to low-order features and local contexts, incurring high compute when scaling to global attention. There is a need for scalable, expressive models that can handle high-order geometric information in physical, chemical, and vision tasks.

Method: Propose Clebsch-Gordan Convolution on SO(3) irreps to realize global attention within an equivariant framework. Achieves O(N log N) input token complexity and leverages sparsity of the Clebsch-Gordan matrix to scale to high-order features. Optional token permutation equivariance is provided via weight sharing or data augmentation.

Result: Empirical benchmarks across n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification, and a robotic grasping dataset show clear gains in GPU memory footprint, speed, and accuracy compared to existing equivariant transformers.

Conclusion: The CK-Transformer delivers scalable, expressive, high-order equivariant modeling with efficient global attention, and practical performance improvements across diverse domains; permutation equivariance can be incorporated without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prediction-driven, three-part scheduling system (PreScope) mitigates MoE offload bottlenecks by learning activation patterns, planning prefetch/loading across layers, and decoupling I/O from compute, achieving substantial throughput and latency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE deployment on commodity hardware suffers memory and PCIe bottlenecks when offloading expert weights to CPU memory; accurate activation prediction, bandwidth-aware scheduling, and asynchronous I/O are needed to minimize transfer overheads.

Method: 1) Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) models layer-specific expert activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) computes globally optimal prefetch/loading plans balancing costs; 3) Async I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) decouples I/O from computation to remove waiting bubbles.

Result: PreScope reports 141% higher throughput and 74.6% lower latency than state-of-the-art solutions on MoE deployments with CPU offload.

Conclusion: A modular, prediction-driven approach can effectively address memory and PCIe transfer bottlenecks in MoE on commodity hardware, enabling faster and more efficient inference; effectiveness depends on prediction accuracy and orchestration across components.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face memory and PCIe latency bottlenecks when
deployed on commodity hardware. Offloading expert weights to CPU memory results
in PCIe transfer latency that exceeds GPU computation by several folds. We
present PreScope, a prediction-driven expert scheduling system that addresses
three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth
competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1)
Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert
activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that
generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes VN-HGCN, a virtual-nodes framework for HGNNs enabling long-range information flow with only 4 layers, outperforming baselines across three real-world datasets and generalizable to other HGNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous graphs struggle to capture long-range dependencies and often require deep stacks, leading to high computation costs and over-smoothing; there is a need for efficient long-range information aggregation across types.

Method: Introduce virtual nodes connected to all nodes of each type, forming VN-HGCN. Integrate virtual nodes into the graph to facilitate information flow, enabling effective aggregation with shallow depth (4 layers). Framework is generalizable to other HGNN models.

Result: Empirical evaluations on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show superiority over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: VN-HGCN provides effective long-range information propagation, reduces necessary depth, and generalizes to other HGNNs, offering a versatile approach for heterogeneous graph learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Pure Node Sampling (PNS) to combat Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem in GNNs under class imbalance; a plug-and-play node-synthesis module that improves stability and performance across backbones and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance exists in graphs and GNNs often assume balance; randomness from seeds leads to performance degradation (Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem, RACP); there is a need to eliminate seed-induced variance during node synthesis.

Method: Proposes PNS, a plug-and-play module that operates during node synthesis to mitigate RACP and abnormal neighbor distributions; does not require designing specialized imbalance remedies and is compatible with multiple GNN backbones.

Result: Experiments show PNS reduces sensitivity to random seeds and outperforms baselines across benchmark datasets and backbones; data and code are available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: PNS provides stable, effective mitigation of randomness-driven performance degradation in graph learning under class imbalance and generalizes across datasets and GNN backbones.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

*Kristina P. Sinaga,Arjun S. Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical and empirical study of post-hoc calibration methods (Platt scaling and isotonic regression) with guarantees and complexity bounds, plus experiments on feature informativeness to guide practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc calibration is widely used but lacks deep theoretical understanding, especially how feature quality affects calibration performance; understanding this relationship can inform method choice and resource allocation.

Method: Provide convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample metrics for Platt scaling and isotonic regression; conduct controlled synthetic experiments varying feature informativeness (informative vs. noisy features); perform broad empirical evaluations across real-world datasets and model architectures; compare performance under different feature spaces.

Result: Derived convergence guarantees, complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for the two methods; empirical results show consistent calibration improvements across scenarios; feature informativeness significantly influences calibration robustness; code and data are provided.

Conclusion: Offers practical guidelines for selecting calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints; highlights the role of feature quality in calibration performance and bridges theory with practical UQ implementation.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

### [473] [Beyond Greedy Exits: Improved Early Exit Decisions for Risk Control and Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23666)
*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes UAT, an online, unsupervised threshold adaptation for early-exit DNNs via a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, achieving 1.7–2.1x speedups with ≤2% accuracy loss and robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit DNNs use static confidence thresholds, which can cause overconfident wrong exits and are brittle to distribution shifts encountered during deployment; there is a need for online, unsupervised adaptation of exit decisions.

Method: Frame exit decisions as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and introduce a reward function that balances predictive certainty and reliability, penalizes late exits, and provides theoretical risk guarantees; perform online adaptation of thresholds without supervision; validate across diverse tasks: vision-language understanding, text generation, and classification.

Result: UAT achieves consistent speedups in the range of 1.70–2.10x with minimal performance drop (<2%) compared to full-model performance; demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts across tasks; source code available at provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: UAT offers a general, online adaptive mechanism for early-exit decisions in DNNs, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy and robustness, with theoretical guarantees and cross-domain validation.

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training framework for discrete VAEs that uses the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update a parametric encoder without reparameterization, aided by automatic step-size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, enabling scalable high-dimensional reconstructions and outperforming prior discrete-autoencoder methods on ImageNet 256 (≈20% FID improvement).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete latent bottlenecks are efficient and can be captured with autoregressive discrete distributions, but exact differentiability is blocked by discrete variables. Standard remedies (Gumbel-Softmax, straight-through, or REINFORCE) struggle on high-dimensional tasks like image reconstruction. A differentiable, scalable approach is needed to train discrete VAEs without reparameterization.

Method: Train a parametric encoder using the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder, avoiding reparameterization. Incorporate automatic step-size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder to handle high-dimensional data and scalability. The framework draws inspiration from policy-search techniques.

Result: The method scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for ImageNet 256.

Conclusion: A non-parametric-to-parametric natural-gradient training framework for discrete VAEs is effective at scaling to ImageNet and achieving superior reconstruction quality with discrete latent bottlenecks, addressing differentiability and optimization challenges inherent to discrete representations.

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

### [475] [Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23667)
*Sungmin Cha,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Argues for Align -> KD over KD -> Align in LLM alignment, stressing the reference model's distributional recall. Shows KD->Align harms retrieval of rare but desirable behaviors; demonstrates Align->KD yields higher reward/precision and lower variance in Mixture-of-Gaussians and SmolLM2 alignment; advocates alignment before distillation as a first-order design choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practice distills the alignment signal from a high-recall reference, but the role of the reference's recall in steering alignment objectives is underexplored. The work aims to reveal a fundamental limitation and to advocate a pipeline that preserves recall before distillation.

Method: Provide a minimal theoretical explanation of how a reference model constrains alignment objectives; validate via a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians experiment; empirically compare Align->KD versus KD->Align on SmolLM2-based LLM alignment, using reward and target precision metrics.

Result: Across both synthetic and real-model experiments, Align->KD yields superior target-oriented performance with higher rewards, better precision, and lower variance; KD->Align struggles to align rare desirable behaviors even with strong preference signals.

Conclusion: Distributional recall of the reference model is a first-order design choice in alignment. Alignment should precede distillation (Align->KD) to robustly attain target behaviors across tasks and models.

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

TL;DR: Hermes extends hypergraph-based stock forecasting with a moving aggregation and cross-scale edge-to-edge message passing to better capture lead-lag inter-industry relationships and multi-scale information, achieving better efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock time series exhibit industry correlations; existing hypergraph methods inadequately model lead-lag interactions and multi-scale information, limiting forecasting performance.

Method: Introduce a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module using sliding windows to capture lead-lag dependencies, and cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to fuse information across scales while preserving scale-wise consistency.

Result: Empirical results on real-world stock datasets show Hermes outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Hermes is a promising framework for leveraging inter-industry correlations in stock forecasting, addressing key limitations of prior hypergraph approaches.

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: DIMIGNN introduces diversity-aware neighbor selection and dynamic multi-scale fusion to improve multivariate time series forecasting, addressing neighbor redundancy and single-scale aggregation, and shows consistent improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN-based MTS models often aggregate from neighbors with limited diversity, leading to redundant information, and rely on a single temporal scale for prediction. There is a need to exploit diverse neighbor information and multiple temporal scales.

Method: Proposes a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure high similarity with neighbors while preserving diversity among them, and a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) to adaptively fuse predictions from multiple temporal scales. Integrated into a GNN framework and trained end-to-end on real-world datasets.

Result: DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DNSM and DMFM effectively address neighbor diversity and multi-scale fusion limitations, yielding improved forecasting performance in MTS tasks.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense-model scaling laws do not transfer to MoE models due to multiple influencing factors, their coupling, and non-monotonic effects; there is a need for a fine-grained MoE-specific scaling framework.

Method: Decompose MoE settings into five factors (D, N, Na, G, S); conduct 446 controlled experiments to characterize marginal effects; construct a joint MoE scaling law; derive theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware configurations for G, S, and Na/N; analyze independence and sparsity patterns.

Result: A comprehensive MoE scaling law is obtained that accounts for all five factors; optimal G and S are independent of model architecture and data size; as N grows, the optimal Na/N ratio becomes sparser; provides guidance for MoE design and training.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE scaling law offers accurate, actionable guidance for future MoE model design and training, enabling more efficient scaling and deployment.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

*Danni Yang,Zhikang Chen,Sen Cui,Mengyue Yang,Ding Li,Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi,Haoxuan Li,Jinke Ren,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We present a decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for federated continual learning that forms adaptive, non-overlapping coalitions, guided by a coalitional affinity game, to personalize models and mitigate forgetting, with a merge-blocking and dynamic evolution algorithm; experiments show superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting and non-stationary data distributions in federated continual learning, especially under heterogeneity, where global aggregation or static decentralization can hurt client performance.

Method: Introduce dynamic, task-stage coalitions enabling selective cooperation among clients; non-overlapping coalitions form and evolve per task stage; use a coalitional affinity game to model relationships; quantify cooperation benefits via client gradient coherence and model similarity; propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution algorithm to reach cooperative dynamic equilibrium.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority over various baselines; code is released.

Conclusion: The framework enables personalized, effective decentralized FCL by balancing acquisition of new knowledge with retention of prior learning through dynamic cooperation.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

*Tanya Chowdhury,Atharva Nijasure,Yair Zick,James Allan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mech interpretability of fine-tuned LLMs via hedonic coalitional game theory; extract stable neuron coalitions with non-additive synergy across layers, showing higher synergy than clustering and yielding interpretable, predictive units across LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear form of task-specific representations in mid-layer MLPs; prior probing suggests priors may strengthen/split/vanish with depth; need to study neuron cooperation rather than isolation to understand feature encoding.

Method: Model neurons as agents in a hedonic game with preferences capturing synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Use top-responsive utilities and PAC-Top-Cover to extract stable coalitions (groups whose ablation effects are non-additive). Track coalition dynamics across layers as persistence, splitting, merging, or disappearance.

Result: Coalitions exhibit consistently higher synergy than clustering baselines. They reveal higher-order cooperative structure beyond disentanglement and yield functionally important, interpretable, and predictive units across domains on LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers trained on scalar IR tasks.

Conclusion: Hedonic coalitions provide a principled, interpretable unit of computation in fine-tuned LLMs by capturing cooperative neuron interactions, enabling robust understanding of how features are encoded and propagated across layers.

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Domain-Adversarial Training with proximal regularization improves cross-site generalization for medical imaging under privacy constraints, outperforming FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving domain generalization in medical imaging FL is needed due to scanner-induced domain shifts and data-sharing restrictions; existing DG approaches assume centralized data, which FL forbids.

Method: Integrates a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) into federated learning and adds proximal regularization to stabilize adversarial training across clients; evaluated on 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs from OpenBHB with cross-site setup (15 training sites, 19 unseen test sites).

Result: The federated DANN with proximal stabilization achieves superior cross-site generalization compared to FedAvg and ERM on unseen sites while maintaining data privacy.

Conclusion: A privacy-friendly DG approach for FL in medical imaging is feasible: federated DANN with proximal regularization yields better generalization across sites without sharing raw data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

*Ankit Gangwal,Aaryan Ajay Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging does not provide robust defense against transfer adversarial attacks; across 336 settings, transfer success remains high, with weight averaging being especially vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how model merging affects the transferability of adversarial examples and provide guidance for designing secure MM-based systems.

Method: Empirical study spanning 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods (336 attack settings), with statistical analyses.

Result: MM cannot reliably defend against transfer attacks; observed relative transfer attack success rates exceed 95% in many settings. Three key insights: (1) stronger MM methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating representation bias increases vulnerability; (3) weight averaging, though the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable to transfer attacks. Analysis of underlying causes and potential remedies.

Conclusion: These results highlight the need for secure MM design and evaluation against transfer attacks, including strategies to mitigate representation bias and to reassess the security implications of stronger MM techniques.

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

### [483] [Estimating Time Series Foundation Model Transferability via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23695)
*Qingren Yao,Ming Jin,Chengqi Zhang,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Jun Qi,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeTic reframes model selection for time-series foundation models as in-context learning, using tabular meta-features and an entropy-based model-characterization to estimate transfer performance after fine-tuning. It achieves ~0.6 mean rank correlation on unseen data and ~30% gains over zero-shot transfer scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As TSFMs proliferate, fine-tuning data is scarce; selecting the best model for downstream tasks is crucial but challenging. Existing zero-shot scores are not reliably predictive for fine-tuned performance across diverse datasets; there is a need for a flexible transferability estimator that generalizes across models and test-time scenarios.

Method: Construct a transferability estimator (TimeTic) that treats model selection as in-context learning, using context built from dataset meta-features, model traits, and observed fine-tuned performance. Utilizes tabular foundation models as in-context learners and a novel entropy-evolution-based metric to characterize model embeddings across layers, enabling generalization to new model sets. Evaluates on a benchmark of 10 datasets, 10 TSFMs, and 3 forecasting tasks.

Result: TimeTic's estimates align with actual fine-tuned performance on unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of about 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to relying on zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Conclusion: TimeTic provides a flexible, generalizable transferability estimator for TSFMs, improving model selection for downstream fine-tuning, with entropy-based characterizations enabling better generalization across diverse model families.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

*Ziheng Cheng,Xin Guo,Yufei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time deterministic policy gradient method (CT-DDPG) built on a continuous-time policy gradient with a martingale property, yielding more stable learning and faster convergence in continuous-time RL across varying discretizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete-time RL methods struggle with time discretization when applied to continuous-time problems, causing instability and slow convergence. A principled continuous-time theory and algorithm for deterministic policies is needed.

Method: Derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula using an analogue of the advantage function and prove a martingale characterization; develop the CT-DDPG algorithm to learn deterministic policies in continuous-time environments.

Result: CT-DDPG demonstrates improved stability and faster convergence than existing discrete-time and some continuous-time methods across control tasks with different time steps and noise levels.

Conclusion: The work provides a solid theoretical foundation and a practical algorithm for stable, sample-efficient continuous-time RL with deterministic policies, addressing discretization sensitivity and enabling robust performance.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FraudTransformer enhances GPT-like sequence models with a dedicated time encoder and a learned positional encoder to capture irregular event times and order in payment fraud streams, outperforming traditional ML baselines and transformer variants on a large real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting payment fraud in streaming data requires models that exploit both event order and irregular inter-event times; existing models struggle with time gaps and sequence structure, limiting real-world effectiveness.

Method: Introduce FraudTransformer, a GPT-style sequence model augmented with (1) a dedicated time encoder embedding absolute timestamps or inter-event times, and (2) a learned positional encoder preserving relative order. Trained/evaluated on tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events, compared against four baselines (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM) and transformer ablations missing time or positional components.

Result: On held-out test data, FraudTransformer achieves the highest AUROC and PRAUC, outperforming all baselines and ablated variants that omit either the time or positional component.

Conclusion: Time-aware, order-preserving sequence modeling is effective for real-world fraud detection in streaming banking data, with the approach likely generalizable to other sequential anomaly detection tasks and further improvable via richer time features and model refinements.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning model SAFDNet for intraoperative hypotension early warning that fuses adaptive frequency-domain features with self-adaptive thresholding and interactive attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies; validated on two real-world datasets with high AUROC and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IOH correlates with postoperative complications; existing AI methods struggle to jointly leverage time- and frequency-domain information, model multi-scale dependencies, and resist biosignal noise.

Method: SAFDNet comprises an adaptive spectral block using Fourier analysis to extract frequency-domain features, a self-adaptive thresholding mechanism to suppress noise, and an interactive attention block to model long- and short-term dependencies.

Result: Extensive internal/external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets show SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3% AUROC for IOH early warning, outperforming state-of-the-art models and displaying robustness to noise.

Conclusion: SAFDNet provides accurate, robust IOH early warning with practical clinical applicability, addressing limitations of prior methods by integrating time- and frequency-domain features and noise-robust attention.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate clustering on very large-scale datasets with reduced computational overhead and practical usability.

Method: Use multi-sampling to construct multi-grained granular-balls, forming a statistical skeleton that captures the data's structure and distribution; propose GBSK and an adaptive variant AGBSK with simplified parameter settings.

Result: GBSK achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including up to 100 million instances in 256 dimensions; code and results are available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: GBSK and its adaptive variant offer scalable, accurate clustering with usability benefits for large-scale data; implementation is publicly available for deployment.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

TL;DR: A lightweight delay-based scheduling (DP) for symbolic music generation expands compound-like tokens during decoding to model intra-token dependencies autoregressively without extra parameters, improving efficiency without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the core trade-off in symbolic music generation between efficiency (shorter sequences) and quality (coherence) by enabling intra-token dependencies without adding parameters or changing existing representations.

Method: Introduce a delay-based scheduling mechanism that progressively expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps. This enables autoregressive modeling of dependencies within tokens while keeping representations and parameters unchanged, and can be integrated into existing tokenization schemes.

Result: DP-based decoding improves all evaluation metrics compared with standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets.

Conclusion: DP offers a lightweight, parameter-free approach to balance efficiency and quality in tokenized symbolic music generation, compatible with current representations and easy to integrate.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Batch Normalization can be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning when applied as Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN); an empirical study shows improved stability, faster convergence, better exploration, and wider learning-rate tolerance with practical guidelines and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether BN's advantages in supervised learning translate to the non-i.i.d., evolving distributions of DRL, and identify how to apply BN safely in off-policy actor-critic settings.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study on off-policy actor-critic DRL algorithms, analyzing different training/evaluation modes, identifying failure modes, and introducing Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) with actionable recommendations. Validation includes experiments showing improved stability and performance; provides code in the stated repository.

Result: MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning-rate range, enhances exploration, and reduces optimization difficulty; analysis of failure modes and underlying causes leads to robust integration guidelines.

Conclusion: BN can be effectively adopted in DRL when combined with MA-BN, enabling more robust training and performance gains; the work offers practical guidance and a reference implementation for practitioners.

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

*He Zhu,Junyou Su,Peng Lai,Ren Ma,Wenjia Zhang,Linyi Yang,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) can be understood through the Reward-Weighted Regression (RWR) lens as using a favorable auxiliary distribution, which tightens RL bounds versus standard SFT but suffers from distributional drift that harms stability. Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT) adds lightweight KL regularization to reattach the distribution and stabilize training, yielding consistent gains over SFT and DFT across tasks with little overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why post-training methods like DFT exhibit both gains and instability, and to design a principled fix that preserves favorable bounds while stabilizing training.

Method: Formal analysis of DFT via the Reward-Weighted Regression (RWR) framework to identify the auxiliary distribution it induces; prove tighter RL bounds than SFT; diagnose the lack of distributional anchoring; propose ASFT by adding KL regularization to DFT's reweighting; evaluate empirically across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation with low overhead.

Result: ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across the tested domains, delivering substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: A principled theoretical lens (RWR) clarifies post-training methods, enabling stronger guarantees and practical gains; anchoring via KL regularization resolves drift and stabilizes training while preserving tight RL bounds, making ASFT a robust alternative to SFT and DFT.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Motivation: Interpretable risk scores are vital in clinical decision support, but traditional methods require manual preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and restrictive assumptions that limit flexibility and accuracy.

Method: Introduce SHAPoint, a framework that leverages gradient-boosted trees for predictive power and combines them with point-based score interpretability; supports missing data handling and monotonic constraints; task-agnostic across classification, regression, survival; aims for reduced preprocessing and faster runtimes.

Result: SHAPoint offers greater flexibility, reduced preprocessing, and faster runtime; achieves compact, interpretable scores with predictive performance on par with state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of runtime.

Conclusion: SHAPoint provides a transparent, scalable tool for risk stratification across tasks, balancing interpretability and predictive power.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

### [492] [Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773)
*Utkarsh Sahu,Zhisheng Qi,Mahantesh Halappanavar,Nedim Lipka,Ryan A. Rossi,Franck Dernoncourt,Yu Zhang,Yao Ma,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge homophily exists in LLMs: nearby entities in a graph have similar knowledge levels. A Graph Neural Network regression model predicts entity-level knowledgeability for triplets using neighborhood scores, enabling selective labeling to maximize knowledge coverage and improve multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how knowledge is structurally organized inside LLMs and whether proximity in a knowledge graph correlates with similar knowledge, inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings on semantic clustering and priming.

Method: Represent LLM knowledge as a graph via knowledge checks at triplet and entity levels. Analyze local knowledgeability relationships to uncover homophily. Train a Graph Neural Network regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets using neighborhood information, then use these scores to prioritize labeling under a fixed budget.

Result: Evidence of knowledge homophily: entities closer in the graph tend to have similar knowledgeability. The GNN-based estimator predicts knowledgeability and guides active labeling to cover less-known triplets, improving knowledge injection efficiency and multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: A graph-based, neurally-inspired approach to quantify and inject knowledge into LLMs, with practical benefits for active labeling efficiency and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

*Jiarui Jiang,Wei Huang,Miao Zhang,Taiji Suzuki,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Mamba SSMs for linear regression ICL, proving exponential convergence to the ICL solution, providing a loss bound comparable to Transformers, and revealing an online gradient-descent–like mechanism for in-context learning, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited theoretical understanding of Mamba's in-context learning (ICL), especially for linear regression ICL, a standard benchmark for Transformer-like models.

Method: Develop novel optimization techniques tailored to Mamba's structure to handle non-convex training dynamics, prove exponential convergence to the ICL solution, derive a Transformer-comparable loss bound, and show that Mamba performs an online gradient-descent–like process to learn the latent function in context; validate with experimental simulations.

Result: Proves exponential convergence rate to the ICL solution; derives a loss bound similar in spirit to Transformer analyses; identifies a variant of online gradient descent as the learning mechanism; empirical simulations corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Offers theoretical grounding for Mamba's ICL and highlights a distinct learning mechanism from Transformers, advancing understanding of Mamba's capabilities for long-sequence modeling and ICL tasks.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

*Chunxue Xu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Bryan Hooi,Songze Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study of Visual CoT robustness under image corruptions in VLMs. Visual CoT generally improves accuracy but is more fragile to perturbations; proposes a Grounding DINO-based plug-in to stabilize reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the explicit visual edits in Visual CoT introduce brittleness when images are perturbed, and to provide a practical robustness remedy in a model-agnostic fashion.

Method: Benchmark 12 image corruption types across 4 VQA datasets, comparing VLMs with and without Visual CoT. Analyze intermediate components (edited patches) as fragility sources. Propose a plug-and-play robustness method by integrating Grounding DINO to supply high-confidence local cues and stabilize reasoning.

Result: Visual CoT delivers consistent absolute accuracy gains on clean and noisy images but exhibits greater sensitivity to perturbations, causing sharper degradation than standard VLMs. The edited patches emerge as the primary fragility source. The Grounding DINO-based robustness module stabilizes reasoning and improves robustness in a plug-and-play fashion.

Conclusion: Visual CoT shows fragility to image perturbations, but a simple, architecture-agnostic Grounding DINO integration can effectively bolster visual robustness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

*Anyi Wang,Xuansheng Wu,Dong Shu,Yunpu Ma,Ninghao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Sparse Autoencoder-based refinement (SAE-RSV) denoises and augments steering vectors learned from limited data, improving LLM steering performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steering LLMs without parameter updates is promising, but existing methods rely on large datasets. With small datasets, steering vectors contain task-irrelevant noise that degrades effectiveness, necessitating data-efficient refinement.

Method: Apply Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to steering vectors to semantically denoise by removing task-irrelevant features, then enrich missing task-relevant features via semantic similarity to identified relevant features. Evaluate SAE-RSV against baselines including supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all baselines, including supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Effective steering vectors can be constructed from limited training data by refining the original steering vector through SAEs, enhancing data efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

### [496] [STAIR: Addressing Stage Misalignment through Temporal-Aligned Preference Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23802)
*Yao Luan,Ni Mu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies stage misalignment in preference-based RL for multi-stage tasks and introduces STAIR, a stage-aware reward-learning method that uses contrastive learning to partition time into stages and prioritizes within-stage comparisons, achieving superior multi-stage performance and human-aligned stage representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PbRL suffers in multi-stage tasks due to comparing segments from mismatched stages, which yields uninformative feedback and hinders learning. A stage-aware, adaptive reward signal is needed without relying on task-specific knowledge.

Method: Propose STAIR: learn a stage approximation via temporal distance using contrastive learning to group temporally close states into coherent stages; leverage stage information to prioritize intra-stage reward comparisons; adapts dynamically to policy changes; requires no predefined task knowledge.

Result: Theoretical and empirical validation of stage misalignment; STAIR outperforms baselines in multi-stage tasks and is competitive in single-stage tasks; human studies show the learned stages align with human cognition, supporting effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.

Conclusion: STAIR mitigates stage misalignment in PbRL for multi-stage tasks, enabling better alignment with human intent, with dynamic stage adaptation and cognitive-consistent stage discovery; broadly applicable with strong empirical support.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

### [497] [FedAgentBench: Towards Automating Real-world Federated Medical Image Analysis with Server-Client LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23803)
*Pramit Saha,Joshua Strong,Divyanshu Mishra,Cheng Ouyang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autonomous, agent-driven federated learning for healthcare is proposed, with FedAgentBench to evaluate LLM agents across 40 FL algorithms, 201 datasets, and 6 medical modalities; current models can automate some FL stages, but complex, goal-driven tasks remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world healthcare FL faces significant operational bottlenecks (client selection, coordination, data preprocessing, data harmonization, and algorithm selection). These bottlenecks demand substantial human effort, motivating autonomous agent-based FL where intelligent agents coordinate setup and training with minimal human input.

Method: Introduce an agent-driven FL framework that models key FL workflow phases from client selection to training completion. Develop FedAgentBench to benchmark LLM agents’ ability to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Incorporate 40 FL algorithms tailored to task-specific needs and cross-client characteristics. Build a diverse task suite across 201 datasets spanning 6 modalities (Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, X-Ray). Evaluate 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs across small, medium, and large scales. Assess automated coordination capabilities and identify limitations.

Result: Certain agent cores (e.g., GPT-4.1, DeepSeek V3) can automate multiple FL workflow stages, but more complex, interdependent tasks driven by implicit goals remain difficult for even strong models.

Conclusion: Autonomous agent-driven FL is a promising direction with a valuable benchmark (FedAgentBench), yet achieving robust end-to-end automation for complex, goal-driven orchestration requires further advances in AI agents and coordination strategies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

### [498] [Beyond the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off: A Hidden State Approach for LLM Reasoning in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23808)
*Fanding Huang,Guanbo Huang,Xiao Fan,Yi He,Xiao Liang,Xiao Chen,Qinting Jiang,Faisal Nadeem Khan,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shifts RLVR analysis from token-level trade-offs to hidden-state Effective Rank dynamics, enabling decoupled exploration/exploitation; introduces VERL that uses ERA as meta-controller to synergistically boost both, yielding substantial accuracy gains on Gaokao 2024 and other benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevailing token-level view of RLVR emphasizes exploration-exploitation trade-offs driven by surface metrics. The paper hypothesizes that this trade-off may be an artifact of measurement level and explores hidden-state representations using Effective Rank to expose a potential decoupling and synergy between exploration and exploitation.

Method: Define Effective Rank (ER) for hidden states; derive first- and second-order derivatives, ERV and ERA, to capture exploration and exploitation dynamics; develop Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL) that uses ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a dual-channel incentive structure that enhances both exploration and exploitation; evaluate across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Finds that exploration and exploitation can be decoupled at the hidden-state level; VERL shows consistent gains across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Hidden-state level analysis reveals a decoupled and synergistic relationship between exploration and exploitation; ERA serves as a stable meta-controller for guiding latent dynamics; VERL operationalizes this synergy to improve reasoning performance, suggesting a shift in RLVR evaluation and design focus toward hidden representations.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

### [499] [Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23809)
*Hong Huang,Decheng Wu,Rui Cen,Guanghua Yu,Zonghang Li,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen,Xue Liu,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila introduces a trapping-free ternary quantization by reusing deadzone-trapped weights as dynamic biases, restoring gradient flow and forward signals to reclaim model capacity with negligible overhead, yielding strong edge-LM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantizing LLMs to edge devices is hampered by deadzone trapping and poor gradient signals in ternary weight schemes; there is a need for methods that preserve accuracy without costly retraining or hardware overhead.

Method: Tequila repurposes deadzone weights as dynamic biases to reactivate them, enabling continuous forward signals and direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, with nearly zero inference overhead.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art ternary quantization on five benchmarks; on ARC, achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline and nearly matches full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup.

Conclusion: Tequila offers a practical, efficient quantization approach for deploying advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

*Beiliang Wu,Peiyuan Liu,Yifan Hu,Luyan Zhang,Ao Hu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IndexNet: an MLP-based multivariate time series forecaster augmented with index embeddings (timestamp and channel) to exploit descriptive index information; achieves competitive accuracy and improves interpretability across 12 real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTSF methods largely ignore index-related information (timestamps, variable indices) that carry rich contextual semantics, limiting periodic capture and variable differentiation. Leveraging such information with lightweight MLPs can improve modeling of long-term patterns and heterogeneity.

Method: Introduce IndexNet with an Index Embedding (IE) module comprising Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). TE embeds timestamps and injects them into inputs to capture long-term periodicity; CE assigns each variable a unique, trainable identity embedding to distinguish heterogeneous variables. The model is designed to be plug-and-play and leverages MLP-based architectures for efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 12 diverse real-world datasets shows IndexNet achieves competitive performance against mainstream baselines. Plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses indicate strong generality and interpretability of the temporally and variably aware design.

Conclusion: Incorporating index-aware embeddings into an MLP-based MTSF framework effectively leverages temporal and variable descriptive information, yielding competitive accuracy, better interpretability, and generalizability across datasets.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DyGEval, a test-time evaluator for DGNNs that estimates performance on unseen dynamic graphs by simulating test-time distribution shifts and training a performance predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DGNNs face performance uncertainty when distributions evolve over time; reliable test-time evaluation is needed to decide if a model trained on observed data should be deployed on unseen dynamic graphs.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation to capture training-test distributional differences and provide supervision to train an evaluator; (2) development and training of DyGEval to accurately estimate the deployed DGNN's performance on those test-time graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DyGEval effectively evaluates various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: DyGEval offers a practical tool for evaluating DGNNs at deployment time, enabling safer and more informed decisions about model suitability for unseen dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

*Omri Puny,Yaron Lipman,Benjamin Kurt Miller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A symmetry-aware generative model for crystals that conditions on space group and Wyckoff positions to produce highly symmetric, stable structures, achieving state-of-the-art results in structure prediction and de novo generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models often ignore crystallographic symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistic, low-symmetry crystal proposals. Enforcing space-group and Wyckoff-position constraints should yield more plausible, diverse, and stable crystals.

Method: Introduce Space Group Conditional Flow Matching (SG-CFM): condition the entire generation process on a given space group and Wyckoff positions. Define a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant parametric vector field that keeps atoms within their initial Wyckoff positions. Use a specialized group averaging reformulation to ensure equivariance with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the symmetry-conditioning components.

Conclusion: Conditioning generation on crystallographic symmetry via SG-CFM yields more accurate, symmetry-consistent crystal structures and is computationally efficient, enabling scalable generation of highly-symmetric crystals.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

*Alexander Kolesov,Stepan Manukhov,Vladimir V. Palyulin,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECD2G is a circuit-inspired method that learns currents to transfer probability mass from a source to a target distribution in discrete data, with provable transfer guarantees and proof-of-concept experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a principled, discrete-data–generation mechanism leveraging an electrical-engineering analogy to guarantee accurate mass transport between distributions.

Method: Represent the source and target samples as input/output nodes of a neural-network-driven circuit; learn currents that define probability flow; sample from the source and move through the circuit along learned currents to reach the target distribution; the process guarantees transfer between distributions.

Result: The approach yields a provable guarantee of distribution transfer; initial proof-of-concept experiments illustrate feasibility.

Conclusion: ECD2G introduces a novel, theory-grounded framework for discrete data generation that connects probability transport with electrical-current flow, suggesting new directions for discrete-domain generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

### [504] [Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23830)
*Albus Yizhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a structured Bayesian MoE routing framework that injects uncertainty at weight, logit, or selection stages; improves routing stability, calibration, and OoD detection in a 3B MoE model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic routing in Mixture-of-Experts leads to brittleness, miscalibration, and overconfidence; a principled uncertainty-aware routing is needed to make LLMs know what they don't know.

Method: Introduce three families of Bayesian routing approaches that model a distribution over routing decisions at different pipeline stages: weight-space, logit-space, and selection-space; demonstrate in experiments on a 3B parameter MoE.

Result: Routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and OoD detection improve; internal uncertainty signal becomes more reliable.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, computationally tractable path toward robust, self-aware LLMs—moving toward systems that can acknowledge uncertainty and ignorance.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

### [505] [Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23846)
*Daniele Foffano,Alessio Russo,Alexandre Proutiere*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial diffusion for robust RL (AD-RRL) uses diffusion models conditioned sampling to generate worst-case trajectories, optimizing CVaR of returns to improve robustness under dynamics uncertainty; shows superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness to modeling errors and environmental dynamics is a central challenge in RL. Diffusion models enable trajectory-level generation and flexible conditional sampling, potentially reducing compounding errors from stepwise models and enabling targeted uncertainty handling.

Method: Introduce AD-RRL, which guides the diffusion process to produce worst-case trajectories during training. This adversarial sampling aligns with CVaR optimization, effectively maximizing the CVaR of cumulative returns. Conditional sampling enables robustness to dynamic uncertainty.

Result: Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks indicate AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and overall performance compared with existing robust RL methods.

Conclusion: AD-RRL demonstrates that diffusion-based adversarial training is an effective mechanism for robust RL under dynamics uncertainty, offering a promising avenue for CVaR-optimized policies.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DART is a decoupled, asynchronous RL training framework for GUI agents that improves data efficiency and system utilization via a four-module architecture and adaptive data curation, achieving significant performance gains on OSWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based GUI agents with vision-language models face slow interaction cycles and limited high-quality data for policy learning; a scalable, asynchronous training framework is needed.

Method: Four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, trainer; non-blocking communication; trajectory sampling; per-worker model synchronization; adaptive data curation (pre-collected trajectories, adaptive rollouts/trajectory lengths, high-entropy step training, truncated importance sampling).

Result: On OSWorld, DART-GUI-7B achieves 42.13% task success rate, +14.61 percentage points over the base model, +7.34% over open-source SOTA; gains in efficiency: 1.6x GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9x training throughput, 5.5x environment utilization.

Conclusion: DART offers an effective, scalable solution for training GUI agents with RL, enabling efficient learning from abundant data and promising open-source release to advance agentic RL.

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [507] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Subliminal learning transfers teacher biases via a small set of divergence tokens, not through global token entanglement or logit leakage; early layers drive the effect; increasing control (masking these tokens) or paraphrasing prompts can suppress it; a single early-layer finetuning suffices to realize subliminal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how subliminal learning occurs during distillation (including hard distillation), identify the mechanisms enabling it, and determine strategies to prevent or mitigate bias transfer.

Method: Controlled experiments separating divergence tokens, masking them, and performing mechanistic analyses; ablation studies that test the role of early layers; finetuning a single early layer; tests showing the effect of paraphrasing prompts on subliminal learning.

Result: Subliminal bias transfer arises from a small set of divergence tokens—rare cases where teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking these tokens largely eliminates the bias transfer. Early layers are critical mechanistically; finetuning even one early layer suffices for subliminal learning. The phenomenon is fragile; small changes like paraphrasing prompts can usually suppress it.

Conclusion: Subliminal learning is localized and not explained by global entanglement or logit leakage. Bias transfer can be mitigated by focusing on divergence tokens and by perturbing early-layer representations or prompts. These findings have implications for the safety and control of distillation-based models.

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

*Yash Jakhmola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified linear-convergence proof for gradient flow in training neural networks with piecewise polynomial, ReLU, or sigmoid activations; a single general theorem that covers and unifies prior results; exact in the infinitesimal step-size limit and empirically aligns with practical gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain the remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in training large neural networks and provide a unified theoretical understanding of linear convergence across architectures.

Method: Develop a single, general theorem proving linear convergence of continuous gradient descent (gradient flow) for networks with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or ReLU/sigmoid activations; broaden previous results under weaker assumptions and connect to existing results; analyze in the infinitesimal step-size limit and validate with experiments.

Result: A unified proof of linear convergence for gradient flow in training the specified neural networks; covers architectures previously unknown; consolidates prior results under weaker assumptions; exact in the continuous-time limit and shows strong empirical agreement with finite-step gradient descent.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified theoretical framework for linear convergence in training diverse neural networks using gradient flow, with results exact in the infinitesimal-step limit and practical relevance demonstrated through empirical alignment.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

### [509] [Dynamic Orthogonal Continual Fine-tuning for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgettings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23893)
*Zhixin Zhang,Zeming Wei,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs by tracking drift of functional directions and enforcing orthogonality between new-task gradients and past directions, improving long-term continual learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge in continual learning for large language models. Regularization-based methods fail in long-horizon settings because historical knowledge drifts as models are fine-tuned on new sequential data without access to past data.

Method: Identify and monitor the drift of functional directions during fine-tuning, dynamically update these directions, and adjust the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical directions to reduce interference between old and new tasks.

Result: Empirical results on diverse LLM continual learning benchmarks show that DOC outperforms prior methods, reducing forgetting and enabling more robust continuous fine-tuning across tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic orthogonal tracking of functional directions provides an effective strategy for continual LLM fine-tuning, offering a robust tool to mitigate forgetting in long-term continual learning; code is released.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

### [510] [Differentiable Sparsity via $D$-Gating: Simple and Versatile Structured Penalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23898)
*Chris Kolb,Laetitia Frost,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Gating offers a fully differentiable structured overparameterization for group sparsity, aligning with L_{2,2/D} regularization and converging fast in gradient flow, enabling strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured sparsity is powerful but non-differentiable, complicating SGD-based training and often requiring pruning or specialized optimizers without guarantees. The work aims to reconcile sparsity with differentiable optimization and provide theoretical guarantees.

Method: Introduce D-Gating: split each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating factors, creating a differentiable, overparameterized representation. Prove that local minima under D-Gating align with local minima of a non-smooth L_{2,2/D} penalty; show exponential convergence of the D-Gating objective to the L_{2,2/D}-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Argue equivalence to the original group sparsity problem but with different learning dynamics that transition from non-sparse to sparse regimes.

Result: The framework yields strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs across vision, language, and tabular tasks, outperforming direct optimization of structured penalties and standard pruning baselines.

Conclusion: D-Gating theoretically mirrors the original group sparsity problem while enabling differentiable optimization and distinctive training dynamics that move from a dense to sparse regime, with empirically favorable results across diverse domains.

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

*Tianjiao Sun,Ningyan Guo,Haozhe Gu,Yanyan Peng,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A MARL-based joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control framework for UAV swarms improves energy efficiency and fairness in complex terrains using MAHPPO-AM with action masking, achieving 0.99 fairness and up to 25% energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unpredictable, dynamic air-to-ground channels and energy constraints in UAV swarms operating in complex geographic environments. The goal is to maintain fair QoS for mobile ground users while reducing UAV energy expenditure through integrated communication and control optimization.

Method: Formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and apply a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) to handle hybrid action spaces and enforce hard constraints.

Result: Experimental results show a fairness index of 0.99 and up to 25% reduction in energy consumption compared to baseline methods, demonstrating improved reliability and efficiency in UAV swarm communications.

Conclusion: An integrated communication and control co-design using MARL with action masking effectively enhances UAV swarm network performance in challenging environments by balancing fair QoS and energy efficiency; promising for scalable real-time deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: GMAN extends Graph Neural Additive Networks to learn from sparse time-series by treating each trajectory as a directed graph and applying an enriched GNAN. It offers a controllable interpretability-expressivity trade-off via feature/graph grouping and provides multi-level explanations. It achieves competitive performance while delivering domain-aligned explanations on tasks like mortality prediction and fake-news detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for models that are both expressive and interpretable when learning from sparse, time-dependent data. Existing black-box models may perform well but lack actionable explanations in real-world domains.

Method: Represent each time-dependent trajectory as a directed graph and apply an enhanced GNAN to each graph. Allow grouping of features and graphs to encode priors, enabling a tunable interpretability–expressivity trade-off. Provide explanations at the feature, node, and graph levels.

Result: GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines on real-world datasets and delivers actionable, domain-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: GMAN provides a flexible, interpretable framework for learning from sparse time-series data, balancing expressivity and interpretability through priors and graph-level reasoning, with practical benefits demonstrated on real tasks.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and

### [513] [HiViS: Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23928)
*Zhinan Xie,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS proposes an explicit-implicit input decomposition to accelerate speculative decoding in Vision-Language Models by removing visual tokens from the drafter input and reusing the target VLM's last-layer states as implicit visual information, paired with a multi-step self-feedback training strategy. It achieves substantial efficiency gains with minimal loss in generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding speeds up inference but faces two main issues in VLMs: (1) misalignment between visual token representations in drafter and target VLM introducing KB-cache bias, and (2) large visual token counts slow the drafter's self-attention. There is a need to adapt speculative decoding to multimodal models without sacrificing quality.

Method: Remove all visual tokens from the drafter input, using only textual tokens as explicit inputs. Reuse the target VLM's corresponding last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information. Train the drafter with a multi-step self-feedback strategy incorporating dynamic data selection and sequential embedding supervision to simulate reasoning, achieving a short prefill sequence (0.7%-1.3% of the target input).

Result: Demonstrates up to 2.65x speedup in inference across diverse models and tasks, with lossless generation quality maintained.

Conclusion: HiViS delivers a practical framework for accelerating vision-language inference by decoupling visual inputs from the drafter and leveraging implicit visual context, supported by an effective training scheme. It shows sizable speedups and broad applicability to VLMs.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzes MoE mechanisms with an internal metric (MUI); shows neuron utilization declines with scale, dynamic training trajectories, collaborative multi-expert contributions with shared experts, and neuron activations as proxies for data diversity; positions MUI as a valuable complement to performance benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance gains of MoE are well-documented, but internal mechanisms remain poorly understood; a routing-aware internal metric could illuminate dynamics, specialization, and capacity.

Method: Define and apply MUI to routing and expert-level behavior; analyze neuron-level and expert-level metrics across a broad set of public MoE models; assess neuron utilization, training trajectory, contribution patterns, and activation diversity.

Result: Four findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models grow; (2) training exhibits dynamic trajectory; (3) task completion arises from collaboration of multiple experts; (4) activation patterns at neuron level reflect data diversity.

Conclusion: MUI complements benchmarks for understanding MoE capacity, dynamics, and specialization; provides a tool to interpret MoE behavior beyond performance; project link.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

### [515] [Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937)
*Akhil Premkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models can be interpreted through an information-theoretic lens: conditioning binds the signal X to Y via mutual information, and classifier-free guidance boosts this mutual information during sampling. This helps image models where image–label mutual information is intrinsically low due to the manifold structure. The work also challenges the view of diffusion models as infinitely deep autoencoders and links the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule, blending ideas from information theory and quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how conditioning information is preserved and utilized in diffusion models, connect diffusion models to decision-theoretic criteria (Kelly criterion), and relate the diffusion framework to information-theoretic and physics concepts (manifold hypothesis, quantum mechanics).

Method: The authors present a theoretical analysis showing that conditional diffusion models store information binding the signal X with conditioning Y, quantified by the mutual information I(X;Y). They argue that classifier-free guidance increases this MI at sampling time, and discuss implications for image-models where I(X;Y) is typically small due to the manifold structure. They also critique the view that diffusion models are infinite-depth autoencoders and relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

Result: Key claim: the conditioning signal Y binds with X to encode mutual information I(X;Y) in conditional diffusion models; classifier-free guidance acts to boost I(X;Y) during sampling. This provides an information-theoretic explanation for improved conditioning, particularly in image tasks where image–label MI is low. The work also refines the interpretation of diffusion models (not simply infinite-depth autoencoders) by linking denoising dynamics to a quantum-mechanical principle.

Conclusion: The abstract proposes a cross-disciplinary framework linking diffusion modeling, information theory, decision theory (Kelly criterion), and physics (Fermi Golden Rule), offering new insights into how conditioning information is stored and exploited and urging reevaluation of the diffusion-as-autoencoder viewpoint.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework (CorText) maps fMRI signals into an LLM latent space to enable open-ended language interaction with brain activity, achieving image captioning and Q&A with zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static neural decoding toward interactive, generative brain–language interfaces that can flexibly interpret neural data without explicit external supervision.

Method: Train a model to embed fMRI data collected while participants viewed natural scenes into the latent space of a large language model, enabling caption generation and detailed questions; evaluate zero-shot generalization; perform counterfactual in-silico cortical stimulation analyses.

Result: CorText generates accurate image captions and answers more detailed questions than controls using only neural data; demonstrates zero-shot generalization beyond training categories; counterfactual analyses emulate cortical microstimulation.

Conclusion: Represents a shift from passive decoding to generative, flexible interfaces between brain activity and language, enabling naturalistic interaction with neural data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible

### [517] [Efficient Identification of High Similarity Clusters in Polygon Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23942)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable framework to reduce verification needs in large-scale spatial similarity tasks via dynamic thresholds, ML prioritization, and KDE-based adaptive thresholds, achieving lower compute while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling spatial similarity computations on very large geospatial datasets confronts substantial verification costs; while tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton improve performance, a reduction in candidate clusters is needed to maintain feasibility.

Method: Proposes a framework that combines dynamic similarity index thresholding, supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization. It uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to adaptively determine similarity thresholds and machine learning models to prioritize clusters, reducing verifications while meeting precision/recall constraints.

Result: Demonstrates substantial reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy; shows scalability and effectiveness on large-scale geospatial analysis tasks.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, scalable solution for large-scale geospatial similarity analysis that can operate under user-defined precision and recall specifications.

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

*Kaisen Yang,Lixuan He,Rushi Shah,Kaicheng Yang,Qinwei Ma,Dianbo Liu,Alex Lamb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E^2C decouples reasoning into an exploratory high-level planning phase and a deterministic execution phase, enabling efficient test-time scaling, improved interpretability, and cross-domain gains via EF-SFT and RL; achieves 58.1% AIME'2024 accuracy with <10% decoding tokens and up to +14.5% medical accuracy with 3.5% tokens; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency, limited exploration, and poor interpretability of monolithic chain-of-thought in LLMs, by decoupling high-level planning from low-level execution.

Method: Two-stage training: stage-1 supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a data-generation algorithm that enforces strict adherence to high-level plans; stage-2 reinforcement learning (RL) to leverage exploration signals and reinforce deterministic execution; test-time scaling strategy demonstrated on AIME'2024; exploration-focused SFT (EF-SFT) for cross-domain adaptation using only 3.5% of standard SFT tokens.

Result: On AIME'2024, E^2C achieves 58.1% accuracy with <10% of decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought); EF-SFT yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy on medical benchmarks using 3.5% tokens; claims state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning from execution yields efficiency, interpretability, and generalization gains; E^2C demonstrates substantial token-efficient performance and strong cross-domain results, with accompanying open-source code and models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

### [519] [DiBS-MTL: Transformation-Invariant Multitask Learning with Direction Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23948)
*Surya Murthy,Kushagra Gupta,Mustafa O. Karabag,David Fridovich-Keil,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiBS-MTL adapts the Direction-based Bargaining Solution to multitask learning to achieve Pareto-stationary solutions robust to monotone, nonaffine task-loss transformations; it provides theoretical convergence (subsequence to Pareto stationary point under nonconvex losses) and empirical competitive performance with robustness advantages over prior bargaining-inspired methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL losses can be nonlinearly and nonaffinely scaled across tasks, causing some tasks to dominate training and hurt overall performance. Existing methods often depend on loss/gradient magnitudes and are sensitive to monotone transformations. A bargaining-based approach (DiBS) promises invariance to monotone transformations but its nonconvex convergence in MTL is unknown.

Method: Extend DiBS to MTL (DiBS-MTL): a computationally efficient adaptation that (i) yields Pareto-stationary solutions under monotone nonaffine transformations and (ii) empirically validates convergence properties on standard MTL benchmarks.

Result: Theoretically, a subsequence of DiBS-MTL iterates converges to a Pareto stationary point even when task losses are nonconvex. Empirically, DiBS-MTL achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art MTL methods and shows robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that degrade other approaches, including prior bargaining-based methods.

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL provides a robust, scalable solution for MTL that achieves Pareto-stationary solutions invariant to monotone nonaffine task-loss transformations, with strong empirical performance and theoretical convergence guarantees in nonconvex settings.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

### [520] [Evaluating the Robustness of Chinchilla Compute-Optimal Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23963)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chinchilla's compute-optimal scaling remains robust to parameter interpretation and perturbations; core scaling-law estimates and the compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio are preserved, supporting its use as a reliable scaling guide.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address contemporary criticisms of Chinchilla (confidence intervals, scaling-law discrepancies, and parameter ambiguities) and assess whether its prescriptions remain trustworthy.

Method: 1) Re-examine three plausible interpretations of the model parameters and quantify the impact on scaling-law estimates and the tokens-per-parameter ratio; 2) perturb model parameters in four structured ways to test sensitivity; 3) evaluate how these changes affect the observed relationships.

Result: Parameter interpretations differ by up to 15.2%, but these differences do not meaningfully alter the key results: the scaling-law estimates and the compute-optimal tokens-per-parameter ratio remain largely intact. In some interpretations, the ratio appears more constant with target compute. Perturbations show that additive or systematic errors threaten the flatness of the ratio more than the core results, but overall the key findings withstand sizable perturbations.

Conclusion: Chinchilla remains a durable, trustworthy guide for scaling language models; practitioners can rely on its prescriptions with some caution about potential minor perturbations in parameter choices or additive/systematic errors.

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

### [521] [Detecting and Rectifying Noisy Labels: A Similarity-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23964)
*Dang Huu-Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-hoc, model-agnostic detection and rectification of label noise using penultimate-layer features to detect mislabels via tight intra-class clusters, enabling automatic corrections and cleaner datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise degrades neural network training; with ever-larger networks, there is a need for automated, post-hoc tools that can both detect and rectify mislabeled data without requiring model training from scratch.

Method: Leverages penultimate features from a trained network. Measures similarity between each data point's penultimate representation and data points of its claimed class versus other classes. If the data point lies in a tight cluster of a different class, flag as mislabeled and possibly relabel to the class with the closest cluster; builds a model-agnostic, post-hoc detector and rectifier.

Result: Extensive experiments show high detection performance across various label-noise levels and automatic rectification improves dataset quality.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective, model-agnostic post-hoc solution for label-noise detection and correction, leveraging feature-space clustering to identify mislabeled samples and improve downstream learning.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

*Maruf Ahmed Mridul,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning is used to synthesize Solidity contracts from CDM specifications, optimizing both correctness and gas usage via PPO with a two-phase curriculum, achieving substantial gas savings on unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating high-level financial specifications (CDM) into gas-efficient, functionally correct on-chain code is difficult. Current approaches struggle to jointly ensure correctness and economic viability, hindering real-world adoption of smart-derivative automation.

Method: A PPO-based RL agent selects code snippets from a predefined library to implement contracts from CDM specs. Training occurs in two phases: first optimize for functional correctness, then optimize for gas efficiency. The process handles a large search space via curriculum learning.

Result: The agent learns to generate contracts with significant gas savings, reporting up to 35.59% cost reductions on unseen test data versus unoptimized baselines.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a viable path for automated synthesis of reliable and economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging high-level financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

*Amartya Roy,Devharish N,Shreya Ganguly,Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE is a scalable causal-discovery framework that uses LLM-generated adjacency matrices in a dual-encoder RL setup to improve accuracy and reduce runtime, achieving 70+ node scalability and robust mixed-data handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern causal discovery methods face critical bottlenecks in scalability, energy efficiency, and handling mixed data types. Benchmarks show traditional algorithms struggle beyond modest node counts and incur high energy costs.

Method: GUIDE couples Large Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data using a dual-encoder architecture. A reinforcement learning agent optimizes accuracy while penalizing DAG-constraint violations, enabling robust performance across mixed data types and scalable graphs (≥70 nodes).

Result: Runtime is reduced on average by ~42% compared to RL-BIC and KCRL. Accuracy improves by ~117% on average over NOTEARS and GraN-DAG. GUIDE maintains robust performance across mixed data types and scales to 70+ nodes, where baseline methods fail.

Conclusion: GUIDE demonstrates that integrating LLM-guided adjacency with an RL-based DAG learner yields scalable, energy-efficient causal discovery with superior accuracy across mixed data, addressing key limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

### [524] [Does Weak-to-strong Generalization Happen under Spurious Correlations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24005)
*Chenruo Liu,Yijun Dong,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W2S generalization with pseudolabels depends on group balance: it occurs when the teacher's and unlabeled data have matching minority proportions, but can fail as their mismatch grows; a simple high-confidence retraining step improves performance without needing group labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how weak-to-strong generalization interacts with spurious correlations due to group imbalance, and providing a practical remedy to make W2S robust in real-world imbalanced settings.

Method: Theoretically characterize W2S gain in a proportional asymptotic limit as a function of the teacher-label minority η_l and unlabeled minority η_u; show gain is guaranteed when η_u = η_l and diminishes with (η_u−η_l)^2; validate with experiments on spurious-correlation benchmarks and various teacher–student pairs; propose a label-free retraining step on the student’s high-confidence subset after W2S fine-tuning.

Result: W2S gains vanish or shrink as the mismatch (η_u−η_l)^2 grows; empirical results support the theory across benchmarks and pairs; the proposed high-confidence retraining remedy yields consistent, substantial improvements over vanilla W2S without using group labels.

Conclusion: W2S can be reliable under matched group proportions, but fails gracefully with mismatch; a simple, group-label-free high-confidence retraining step provides a practical, effective boost to W2S in the presence of spurious correlations.

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

*Jintao Zhang,Haoxu Wang,Kai Jiang,Shuo Yang,Kaiwen Zheng,Haocheng Xi,Ziteng Wang,Hongzhou Zhu,Min Zhao,Ion Stoica,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA accelerates diffusion transformer attention by fusing sparse and linear attention, achieving substantial speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In diffusion transformers for video generation, attention is the bottleneck due to long sequences and quadratic complexity. The authors observe that attention weights split into a small high-rank set and a large low-rank remainder, suggesting that we can selectively accelerate different parts of the attention.

Method: Propose Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) that classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible; applies O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skips negligible ones. All computations are fused into a single GPU kernel and SLA supports forward and backward passes. The approach is trainable with a few fine-tuning steps.

Result: Achieves about 20× reduction in attention computation; maintains end-to-end generation quality with no degradation and outperforms baselines. An optimized GPU kernel delivers about 13.7× speedup in attention computation and 2.2× end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B models.

Conclusion: SLA provides a practical, trainable fusion of sparse and low-rank attention that significantly accelerates diffusion models without sacrificing generation quality, outperforming existing baselines and enabling efficient deployment.

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

### [526] [Pretraining Scaling Laws for Generative Evaluations of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24012)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Brando Miranda,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes and evaluates three pretraining scaling laws for generative evaluations (pass-at-k) and for predicting the performance of expensive models using cheaper ones. The three scaling laws differ in covariates: (i) compute, (ii) model parameters and tokens, (iii) log-likelihoods of gold reference solutions. Key findings: generative evaluations introduce a controllable hyperparameter k; stabilization ranges are ~1.5–2.5 orders of magnitude for compute and params+tokens, ~5 orders for gold LL; all three laws show comparable predictive performance with subtle trade-offs; compute-law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the parameters+tokens law; framework to forecast generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scaling laws have been effective for pretraining and discriminative evaluations, but less so for generative evaluations (e.g., math problem solving, software engineering). The work seeks to fit scaling laws to pass-at-k metrics on generative tasks and to predict the performance of the most expensive model from cheaper ones, enabling better forecasting and design choices for large-scale models.

Method: Fit three scaling laws using pass-at-k on generative evaluations, with covariates: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log-likelihoods of gold reference solutions. Evaluate predictive accuracy of each law across different k and model scales, and analyze stabilization ranges. Also establish a theoretical connection showing the compute scaling law as the envelope of the parameters+tokens scaling law.

Result: All three scaling laws perform comparably in predictive accuracy. The compute-law slightly underperforms for small k, and the gold-reference-log-likelihood law underperforms for large k. Stability thresholds differ: compute and parameters+tokens stabilize over the last ~1.5–2.5 orders of magnitude; gold LL stabilizes over the last ~5 orders. A theoretical link shows the compute law as the compute-optimal envelope of the parameters+tokens law.

Conclusion: Generative tasks benefit from scalable laws with tunable hyperparameters (k). The proposed framework enables forecasting generative performance and offers practical guidance for predicting expensive-model performance from cheaper models. The findings illuminate how different covariates shape scaling behavior and highlight that a compute-centric law can serve as an economical envelope for other approaches.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-modality trajectory foundation model (GPS-MTM) uses states (POI categories) and actions (transitions) with masked self-supervised learning to model mobility data, enabling robust trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction and strong performance on dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on manually labeled data and flattened coordinate representations; learn rich semantic correlations in mobility patterns from large-scale data to enable robust downstream analytics.

Method: Bi-directional Transformer that jointly encodes states and actions, trained with a self-supervised masked modeling objective to reconstruct missing segments across modalities and learn cross-modal correlations.

Result: GPS-MTM outperforms baselines on trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction across Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, with especially strong performance on dynamic tasks requiring contextual reasoning (inverse/forward dynamics).

Conclusion: Mobility data can be treated as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning; GPS-MTM provides a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, and code is released for research use.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

### [528] [Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24047)
*Runyu Zhang,Na Li,Asuman Ozdaglar,Jeff Shamma,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework that treats risk-seeking as optimism in cooperative MARL, introducing divergence-penalized optimistic value functions, a policy-gradient theorem, and decentralized optimistic actor-critics that improve coordination over baselines and heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Risk sensitivity and optimism are key to effective coordination in MARL. Existing risk-averse approaches can hinder cooperation; while optimistic methods are effective, they lack theory. A principled, grounded framework to integrate risk preferences with optimism is needed.

Method: Leverage the dual representation of convex risk measures to interpret risk-seeking as optimism. Define optimistic value functions with divergence penalties. Derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for entropic risk (KL) penalties. Develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms implementing these updates.

Result: Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks show that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination compared to risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.

Conclusion: The work unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism into a theoretically grounded framework that enhances cooperation in MARL and provides practical algorithms with solid foundations.

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in

### [529] [Collaborative Device-Cloud LLM Inference through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24050)
*Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Liangqi Yuan,Christopher Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An on-device LLM learns to decide, after solving, whether to offload to cloud LLMs to balance performance and latency. It replaces external binary router with post-training routing, using reward-based learning (group-adaptive policy gradient) and adaptive prompt filtering, achieving better results and approaching full cloud performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency and cloud cost while preserving performance by integrating routing into the on-device model; existing routers struggle to infer task difficulty from prompt patterns.

Method: Post-training framework where on-device LLM makes final routing decision; formulate as reward maximization; propose group-adaptive policy gradient with group-level unbiased gradient estimation; implement adaptive prompt filtering to constrain cloud usage.

Result: Experiments across models and benchmarks show consistent improvement over baselines and significant narrowing of the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective on-device routing decisions, reducing unnecessary cloud usage while maintaining high performance; the method provides unbiased gradient estimation and constraints via prompt filtering.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

### [530] [On The Variability of Concept Activation Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24058)
*Julia Wenkmann,Damien Garreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantifies how sampling randomness affects Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and shows their variance scales as 1/N, enabling resource-efficient use of CAV-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI methods using high-level concepts (CAVs) can vary with random sampling. The paper aims to quantify this variability to improve reliability and guide practical usage.

Method: Theoretical analysis of CAV construction to derive the variance scaling with the number of random samples N, supplemented by experiments on multiple real-world datasets to validate the theoretical result.

Result: The variance of CAVs decreases as 1/N; empirical validation supports the 1/N scaling. The authors provide practical recommendations for resource-efficient application of CAVs.

Conclusion: CAV-based explanations are subject to sampling variance, but this variance is predictable and decreases with more samples, enabling practitioners to plan data sampling to achieve desired precision and reliability.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

### [531] [In-Context Compositional Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24067)
*Qiushui Xu,Yuhao Huang,Yushu Jiang,Lei Song,Jinyu Wang,Wenliang Zheng,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICQL reframes offline RL Q-learning as contextual inference using linear Transformers to infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions, enabling compositional, subtask-aware value estimation without explicit labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single global Q-functions fail to capture task composition across diverse subtasks; offline RL needs methods that can adapt Q-functions to local context.

Method: Represent Q-learning as contextual inference; use linear Transformer to condition Q-function on retrieved transitions; infer local Q-functions without subtask labels; present theoretical guarantees under linear approximability and weight inference accuracy; derive bounded error and near-optimal policy extraction.

Result: Empirically improves offline RL performance: up to 16.4% in Kitchen tasks; up to 8.6% in Gym; up to 6.3% in Adroit; demonstrates benefits of in-context learning for robust compositional value estimation.

Conclusion: ICQL provides a principled framework for compositional Q-estimation in offline RL, leveraging contextual inference to adaptively compose local Q-functions from data, improving policy quality without requiring subtask annotations.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

*Roussel Rahman,Jeff Shrager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes Strategy Choice Theory as a Small Math Model (SMM) with neural-network-like components to study arithmetic learning, showing interference between counting and addition and wave-like finger-counting; plans to extend toward adaptive strategy choice and strategy discovery in LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify cognitive-development SCT with modern neural architectures, enabling investigation of numerical reasoning and strategy use in LLM-like agents.

Method: Introduce a neural-network–based SMM that extends SCT with counting practice, symbol (number) embeddings, and gated attention; model constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition and a wave-like finger-counting mechanism for sum recall; set the stage for adaptive strategy choice and strategy discovery.

Result: The SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition and shows wave-like finger-counting as a mechanism for sum recall, indicating improved numerical processing and alignment with SCT predictions.

Conclusion: The work plans to extend the SMM to adaptive strategy choice and strategy discovery, aiming to provide a unified platform to study numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning as it may emerge in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces AQUAIR, a public 6-variable head-space indoor air dataset from a Moroccan aquaculture facility, with high-frequency logging, calibration, and an open processing pipeline, enabling forecasting and anomaly detection research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets of air around indoor tanks are scarce; need head-space data to couple with water-quality dynamics for smarter aquaculture.

Method: Single Awair HOME monitor; sampling every 5 minutes from Oct 2024 to Jan 2025; 23k observations; ISO-compliant mounting height; calibration checks; quality control; open-source pipeline to normalize timestamps, interpolate gaps, export analysis-ready tables.

Result: Dataset shows stable conditions with feeding-time peaks; publicly archived on Figshare; provides a reproducible benchmark for ML curricula and sensing research in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Conclusion: Fills gap in smart aquaculture informatics; enables short-horizon forecasting, event detection, sensor drift studies; supports head-space dynamics research.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

*Bo Hu,José C. Príncipe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines mixture density networks with contrastive losses by using four kernelized matrix costs to learn multiple centers for Gaussian mixtures in self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. MDNs provide a way to model density via multiple centers. Integrating MDNs with contrastive costs aims to better approximate data density and improve representations.

Method: Introduce four kernelized matrix costs within an MDN-contrastive framework: scalar cost, vector-matrix cost, matrix-matrix cost (trace of Schur complement), and SVD cost (nuclear norm) to learn multiple centers defining a mixture density.

Result: Proposes a data-density approximation framework that leverages the four kernelized matrix costs to learn multiple centers for a Gaussian mixture density in a contrastive/self-supervised setting.

Conclusion: Kernelized matrix costs offer flexible, expressive measures to learn mixture centers, enabling effective data-density estimation within MDN-based approaches for self-supervised and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

### [535] [Demographic-Agnostic Fairness without Harm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24077)
*Zhongteng Cai,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a demographic-agnostic fairness framework (DAFH) that jointly learns a population group splitter and per-group classifiers to achieve preference-based fairness without demographic data; backed by a theoretical sample complexity analysis and validated via synthetic and real-data experiments, with potential outperformance over baselines that use demographic info.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses fairness in ML for social-domain predictions, highlighting the tension between parity-based fairness (which can hurt accuracy) and the desire for accuracy-preserving fairness. Aims to relax the need for explicit demographic data while still achieving favorable fairness/accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Introduce DAFH: jointly learn a group classifier to partition the population into multiple groups and train decoupled classifiers for each group. Operates in a demographic-agnostic setting (no access to individual demographics during training). Provides sample complexity analysis and demonstrates improvements over baselines when demographic information is known, supported by experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows favorable sample complexity and potential to outperform baselines under certain conditions. Empirical results on synthetic and real data validate the method, indicating effective fairness-accuracy trade-offs without requiring demographic data.

Conclusion: DAFH offers a viable approach to achieving preference-based fairness without explicit demographic attributes, balancing fairness and accuracy in high-stakes domains. Further work could explore robustness, scalability, and sensitivity to the learned grouping.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

*Ju-Hyung Lee,Yanqing Lu,Klaus Doppler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEARL uses peer-aware on-device LLMs to adapt Wi-Fi Aware cross-layer parameters for D2D, with two lightweight variants; achieves near-20 ms inference and energy savings while improving objective scores over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cooperative, context-aware cross-layer optimization in D2D communications by leveraging both publisher and subscriber peer states and on-device LLMs for adaptive parameter tuning.

Method: Introduce PEARL framework; use KL-based finetuning on a context-aware reward that normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by battery; implement two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + LoRA) and PEARL-Lite (Head-only); evaluate across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements.

Result: PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in low-battery cases; PEARL-Lite achieves sub-20 ms inference with near-identical objective scores; PEARL (Head + LoRA) offers best overall performance.

Conclusion: Peer-aware context and reward-aligned, head-based fine-tuning make LLM-based cross-layer control practical for always-on, on-device D2D optimization.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

*Evan Dramko,Yihuang Xiong,Yizhi Zhu,Geoffroy Hautier,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT introduces a coordinates-based transformer MLFF for point defects that outperforms GNNs in accuracy and is computationally cheaper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect energetics drive materials properties; first-principles defect calculations are expensive; ML force fields offer speed, but GNNs can suffer from oversmoothing and poor long-range interaction modeling, especially for defects.

Method: Atoms are treated as tokens; all pairwise atomic interactions are explicitly considered; a Transformer encoder models their interactions in a coordinates-in-space formulation, replacing graph-based representations; applied to silicon point defects.

Result: ~33% reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN model, with substantially lower computational cost.

Conclusion: A coordinates-based Transformer MLFF (ADAPT) mitigates oversmoothing and long-range interaction issues common in GNNs for defect modeling, enabling faster and more accurate defect simulations and potentially benefiting high-throughput defect databases.

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

*Sifan Wang,Zhikai Wu,David van Dijk,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoFunFlow is a geometry-aware diffusion framework for inverse PDE problems on complex domains, integrating a geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) with a latent diffusion model to enable accurate reconstructions, calibrated uncertainty, and efficient posterior sampling on unstructured meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse PDE problems are ill-posed, data-sparse, and involve irregular geometries, making classical PDE-constrained optimization expensive. Most learning-based methods struggle with irregular domains or forward-only objectives; there is a need for geometry-aware, efficient inference with uncertainty quantification.

Method: GeoFunFlow combines a geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) that uses a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and outputs continuous field reconstructions, with a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow to enable posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Evaluated on five benchmarks, it aims to achieve high reconstruction accuracy on complex geometries while providing calibrated uncertainty and efficient inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy on complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and offers efficient inference relative to operator-learning and diffusion-model baselines across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow advances geometry-aware inverse problems by marrying a geometry-capable autoencoder with diffusion-based posterior sampling, enabling accurate and uncertainty-aware reconstructions on irregular geometries with improved efficiency over existing baselines.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

*Md Mozaharul Mottalib,Thao-Ly T. Phan,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyMaTE is a hybrid Mamba (SSM) and Transformer model designed for long, multivariate EHR sequences, combining linear-time sequence modeling with advanced attention to produce richer, more interpretable representations and improve predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data are long, multivariate, sparse, and riddled with missing values; standard Transformers have quadratic complexity and limited context length, hindering scalability. SSMs like Mamba offer linear-time sequence modeling but focus on sequence-level rather than channel-level information. A hybrid approach aims to exploit the strengths of both to efficiently model long-term dependencies and channel-wise data in EHRs.

Method: Introduce HyMaTE, a hybrid model that integrates Mamba-like state-space modeling with Transformer-style attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies across channels in longitudinal EHR data. The model aims to produce unified, rich representations, with interpretability from self-attention. The approach is tested on multiple clinical datasets for predictive tasks, and code is released.

Result: HyMaTE demonstrates the ability to produce effective, richer, and more nuanced representations of EHR data, achieving competitive predictive performance while maintaining efficiency for long sequences. Self-attention-based interpretability provides insights into model decisions.

Conclusion: HyMaTE offers a scalable, generalizable solution for real-world healthcare applications by combining the efficiency of state-space models with the expressive power and interpretability of attention mechanisms. The work provides code for replication at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo Flow Networks (EFNs) extend Echo State Networks with MCRA and a dual-stream memory to efficiently capture long-range temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art results with faster training and smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and nonlinear expressive power in time-series forecasting, leveraging reservoir computing with enhanced dynamics and selective memory.

Method: EFNs consist of a group of extended ESNs (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts and a new Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA) to enable neuron-specific temporal dynamics. A dual-stream architecture selects signature reservoir features from infinite-horizon memory based on recent input history. EchoFormer is one instantiation.

Result: EFNs deliver up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size than PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35% (20% relative). EchoFormer achieves new state-of-the-art across five datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Conclusion: EFNs provide a scalable, efficient framework for long-horizon time-series forecasting with improved accuracy and stability; EchoFormer demonstrates strong generalization across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

### [541] [The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24125)
*Rohan Alur,Chris Hays,Manish Raghavan,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inverse permutation learning is impossible for any depth of decoder-only transformers; feasible only under special constructions (encoder–decoder-like masking or padding with scratch tokens), suggesting a potential mechanism behind chain-of-thought like reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the robustness and limitations of decoder-only transformers for reasoning tasks (e.g., long-context retrieval, MCQA, in-context learning) by studying their ability to invert a permutation.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving an impossibility result for arbitrary-depth decoder-only transformers; then present two constructive setups that enable the task: (1) modify the attention mask to mimic encoder–decoder behavior, highlighting a gap in expressivity between encoder–decoder and decoder-only models; (2) pad inputs with non-semantic "scratch" tokens, which makes inverse permutation learning feasible.

Result: An impossibility result showing decoder-only models cannot learn inverse permutation; plus two feasible constructions that enable the task: using causal masking (encoder–decoder style) and using scratch tokens; these results imply architectural choices drive reasoning capabilities and motivate a potential role for intermediate tokens like chain-of-thought prompts.

Conclusion: Architectural design governs the learnability of inverse-permutation tasks in language models. The scratch-token construction hints at how intermediate reasoning tokens could enable complex reasoning, even if they carry no semantic meaning, shedding light on the utility of chain-of-thought prompting.

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

*H. N. Mhaskar,Ryan O'Dowd*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a kernel-based, label-efficient classification framework in arbitrary compact metric spaces using localized trig polynomial kernels to identify class supports and recover the number of classes via a hierarchical MASC algorithm, achieving perfect classification with minimal labeled queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classification is often treated as function approximation, but this approach seeks label-efficient, distribution-based separation in arbitrary metric spaces. It also aims to determine the actual number of classes and handle overlapping/touching boundaries.

Method: Adopts localized trigonometric polynomial kernels originally developed for point-source separation. Treats classes as distributions whose supports are separable by the kernel; applies a hierarchical MASC (multi-class adaptive separation/structure) scheme to handle touching/overlapping boundaries. Provides theoretical guarantees and supports with experiments on simulated data and real datasets (Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets, and a document dataset).

Result: The theory yields the identification of the number of classes and perfect classification with a minimal number of queried labels. Empirical demonstrations on hyperspectral and document datasets illustrate viability.

Conclusion: The work reframes classification as distribution separation in arbitrary metric spaces using localized kernels and a hierarchical scheme, offering a principled, label-efficient method that can handle complex, overlapping boundaries across diverse domains.

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

### [543] [Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146)
*Ethan Zachary Lo,Dan Chie-Tien Lo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage machine learning approach forecasts tropical cyclone trajectories and status by first predicting key features (max wind, min pressure, trajectory length, direction change) using regression on sliding windows, then classifying cyclone status with RF, SVM, and MLP. SMOTE balances classes. Random Forest achieves ~93% accuracy, outperforming SVM/MLP; regression errors are ~2.2 mb and 2.4 kt. ML ensembles show strong potential for real-time, scalable cyclone prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive and error-prone due to atmospheric chaos. There is a need for accurate, fast, scalable forecasting using historical best-track data (including wind radii) to improve decision support and reduce losses.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) regression stage uses a sliding-window time-series of historical data to predict cyclone features: maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change. 2) classification stage uses the predicted features to classify cyclone status. Models evaluated include gradient boosting regression for the regression task; and random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification. Model Selection enhanced by hyperparameter tuning and Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to address class imbalance.

Result: Random Forest classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1-score, and is robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses with few false negatives. Regression outputs show mean absolute errors of ~2.2 mb for pressure and ~2.4 kt for wind speed. The approach demonstrates ML ensembles as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional forecasting with potential for real-time integration into decision support systems.

Conclusion: Ensemble ML models, particularly RF classifiers, offer effective and scalable cyclone forecasting, capable of real-time prediction and integration into decision-support systems, potentially reducing reliance on computationally intensive NWP.

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

### [544] [Stable Forgetting: Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24166)
*Arpit Garg,Hemanth Saratchandran,Ravi Garg,Simon Lucey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretically grounded, parameter-efficient unlearning method stabilizes gradient-difference unlearning in LLMs by bounding updates to LoRA adapters, achieving better forgetting while preserving retention across diverse benchmarks and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and safety requirements demand the removal of influence from specific data in LLMs. The gradient-difference unlearning method can become unstable when combined with cross-entropy loss, causing unbounded weight growth and degraded forgetting/retention.

Method: Provide a theoretical framework showing how forgetting-set ascent destabilizes optimization in MLP layers. Propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning (BPEU) that applies bounded functions to LoRA-based MLP adapters to stabilize weight dynamics during ascent, enabling reliable convergence of the gradient-difference method.

Result: Demonstrates substantial forgetting improvements while preserving retention across TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks, for architectures from 125M to 8B parameters, validating the approach as a theoretically grounded and scalable unlearning framework for LLMs.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel, scalable, and theoretically justified unlearning framework. Bounded functions on LoRA adapters stabilize gradient-difference unlearning, enabling reliable forgetting without sacrificing retained knowledge across varied model sizes and benchmarks.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

### [545] [Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24168)
*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), an asymmetric encoder-decoder that preserves both global and local data geometry, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving geometric structure in latent space is challenging: global distance errors accumulate in global methods; local methods distort large-scale relationships. A hybrid approach is needed to maintain multi-scale geometry.

Method: MAE uses an asymmetric architecture: enforce global distance constraints on the encoder to capture global geometry, and enforce local geometric constraints on the decoder to preserve local structure. The authors provide theoretical analysis justifying the alignment of this design with encoder/decoder roles.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets show MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: Asymmetric, multi-scale geometry preservation in autoencoders yields better latent representations and visualization, with strong empirical support; the approach offers a principled design for future multi-scale geometric learning.

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

### [546] [Model Correlation Detection via Random Selection Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24171)
*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Random Selection Probing (RSP) provides a principled statistical test for model correlation by transferring random prefixes from a reference model to a target model and computing p-values, with an unrelated baseline to reduce false positives; it works for LLMs and VLMs under various access conditions and shows robust discrimination between related and unrelated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models and vision-language models proliferate, there is a need to reliably determine whether one model has been fine-tuned from or is identical to another. Existing similarity-based approaches often require access to parameters or rely on heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting applicability and trust.

Method: RSP formulates model correlation detection as a hypothesis test. It optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target model. It computes p-values to quantify evidence of correlation and uses an unrelated baseline model to filter out generic transferable features, mitigating false positives. The framework is evaluated on both LLMs and VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference and test models.

Result: Across fine-tuned and open-source models, RSP yields small p-values for related model pairs and high p-values for unrelated ones, demonstrating robust discrimination. Extensive ablations show the approach is robust to design choices and access constraints, establishing RSP as a principled and general statistical framework for model correlation detection.

Conclusion: RSP provides a transparent, interpretable, and statistically principled method for detecting whether models are correlated (e.g., fine-tuned versions or duplicates). It broadens the toolbox for model governance across ML ecosystems and is applicable to both textual and visual modalities under varying access conditions.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

### [547] [FM-FoG: A Real-Time Foundation Model-based Wearable System for Freezing-of-Gait Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24176)
*Chuntian Chi,John Clapham,Leslie Cloud,Ingrid Pretzer-Aboff,GinaMari Blackwell,Huajie Shao,Gang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, real-time foundation-model-based FoG detector (FM-FoG) that generalizes to unseen PD patients without per-user training, using self-supervised IMU pretraining and a selective CNN-LSTM trigger; achieves 98.5% F1 on unseen patients and runs efficiently on smartphone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FoG detectors currently rely on patient-specific data and generalize poorly, limiting clinical deployment. There is a need for a generalizable, energy-efficient wearable solution that works across patients without individual retraining.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining on diverse IMU datasets to learn robust representations; sensor context integration; a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier triggers the foundation model only during ambulatory activities (walking/standing) to reduce computation; deployment on a smartphone (Pixel 8a).

Result: On the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients, FM-FoG achieves 98.5% F1-score on unseen patients; battery life extended by up to 72%; intervention latency under 20 ms.

Conclusion: FM-FoG demonstrates practical, energy-efficient generalization across patients without individual training, enabling deployment of FoG detection in real-world wearable healthcare settings.

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

### [548] [Negative Pre-activations Differentiate Syntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24198)
*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A small, specific subset of entangled 'Wasserstein' neurons uses negative pre-activations to differentiate similar inputs, and their targeted ablation collapses language-model performance, revealing a causal role in syntax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and characterize the mechanistic role of a rare neuron class in LLMs and test whether differentiating signals in the negative pre-activation space underlie grammatical behavior.

Method: 1) Identify Wasserstein neurons in the model. 2) Apply sign-specific ablations by zeroing negative pre-activations for a small subset. 3) Compare effects to random and perplexity-matched ablations. 4) Analyze part-of-speech–related surprisal and layer-wise accumulation. 5) Track interventions across training checkpoints as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize.

Result: Targeted zeroing of negative pre-activations in a small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function and disrupts grammatical behavior, whereas random and perplexity-matched controls largely preserve grammar. The excess surprisal localizes to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and layer-wise effects accumulate with depth. As training proceeds and Wasserstein neurons emerge, the same ablation recapitulates the impairment of grammar.

Conclusion: Negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons is a crucial, causally influential mechanism for syntax in language models; these neurons use negative pre-activations to support discriminative processing among similar inputs, and targeted interventions reveal their essential role in grammatical behavior.

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

### [549] [Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm: Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24203)
*Chaorui Yao,Yanxi Chen,Yuchang Sun,Yushuo Chen,Wenhao Zhang,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First-principles off-policy interpretation of group-relative REINFORCE (GRPO) for LLMs; identifies two design principles (regularizing policy updates and shaping data distribution); unifies OPDM and AsymRE as regularized REINFORCE; dispels myths about importance sampling/clipping; empirically validated; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address practical constraints in applying RL to large language models by developing a principled off-policy framework, clarifying the roles of importance sampling and clipping, and unifying recent algorithms under regularized REINFORCE. This aims to enable better off-policy RL methodology for LLMs.

Method: Derive group-relative REINFORCE from first principles without assuming a fixed data distribution, establishing a native off-policy interpretation. From this, extract two general principles for off-policy REINFORCE (policy update regularization and data-distribution shaping). Reinterpret Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) as regularized forms of REINFORCE, and provide theoretical justification for data-weighting heuristics. Validate insights through extensive experiments and provide open-source code.

Result: Provides a principled off-policy interpretation of GRPO, articulates two actionable design principles, and unifies OPDM and AsymRE as regularized REINFORCE. Demystifies the roles of importance sampling and clipping, and offers theoretical backing for data-weighting strategies. Empirically validated on LLM-RL tasks with results supporting the proposed framework.

Conclusion: Off-policy RL for LLMs can be grounded in regularization of policy updates and deliberate shaping of the data distribution. This clarifies misconceptions about IS and clipping, unifies recent algorithms under a common regularized REINFORCE view, and opens avenues for principled off-policy RL design (code available).

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

### [550] [MDD-Thinker: Towards Large Reasoning Models for Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24217)
*Yuyang Sha,Hongxin Pan,Gang Luo,Caijuan Shi,Jing Wang,Kefeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker is an LLM-based diagnostic framework for MDD that combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to improve reasoning, interpretability, and efficiency; trained on large-scale real-world data (UK Biobank and public mental health datasets); achieves superior accuracy and F1 vs baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDD diagnosis relies on subjective assessments; need to integrate multimodal data; LLMs can enhance reasoning but face interpretability/hallucination; propose reasoning-enhanced, data-rich framework.

Method: Generate and fine-tune on 40k reasoning samples from UK Biobank + 10k from public datasets; SFT + RL to strengthen reasoning; evaluate against ML/DL/LLM baselines; measure accuracy, F1, AUC.

Result: Accuracy 0.827, F1 0.808; outperforms SVM/MLP and general LLMs; SFT+RL yields largest gains (≈29% accuracy, 38% F1, 34.8% AUC); comparable reasoning to larger LLMs with lower compute.

Conclusion: First reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world data; balances accuracy, interpretability, efficiency; potential for broader mental health diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

### [551] [Conda: Column-Normalized Adam for Training Large Language Models Faster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24218)
*Junjie Wang,Pan Zhou,Yiming Dong,Huan Li,Jia Li,Xun Zhou,Qicheng Lao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conda is a new optimizer that combines orthogonal projection of updates with column-wise second-moment normalization, improving spectral conditioning while preserving per-coordinate adaptivity, achieving 2–2.5× faster convergence than AdamW on LLaMA GPT-2 pretraining; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in Adam-based pre-training due to poor spectral conditioning and the limited adaptivity, and to surpass Muon’s global spectral normalization by restoring per-coordinate adaptivity.

Method: Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second-moment normalization based on the projected gradients, preserving coordinate-wise adaptivity while improving spectral conditioning.

Result: Empirical results on LLaMA and GPT-2 show Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training, achieving 2–2.5× faster convergence (in both training steps and time) on LLaMA; ablations confirm robustness across training setups.

Conclusion: Conda is an effective, broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training with strong empirical gains; code is publicly released for community use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

### [552] [Semantic Editing with Coupled Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24223)
*Jianxin Zhang,Clayton Scott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coupled SDEs enable training-free, semantically-controlled image editing by guiding sampling of any pre-trained generative model with shared correlated noise, achieving high fidelity and near-pixel consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing images with pretrained text-to-image models often degrades details or introduces artifacts; there is a need for a simple method that preserves similarity to the source while changing semantics without retraining.

Method: Couple the sampling processes of source and edited images via the same correlated noise within SDE-based sampling (diffusion or rectified flow). This binds the two generations, steering toward desired semantics while maintaining similarity to the original image; works with any pretrained model that supports SDE sampling and requires no retraining or auxiliary networks.

Result: Out-of-the-box applicability, no retraining, high prompt fidelity, near-pixel-level consistency between edited and source images across edits.

Conclusion: Coupled SDEs offer a simple, general, and effective tool for controlled generative AI, enabling reliable content editing without model retraining or extra components.

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

TL;DR: A practical API-based framework decouples the ML lifecycle from production, delivering ML analytics via a browser-based UI to domain experts, reducing hardware upgrades, downtime, and costs for SMEs in manufacturing, with a human-in-the-loop to boost trust and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial ML adoption is impeded by high upfront costs, disruption of legacy systems, and the need for specialized infrastructure and skills. A lightweight, API-driven solution can lower barriers and enable widespread deployment, especially for small/medium enterprises.

Method: Proposes a decoupled ML lifecycle architecture connected through APIs to production environments, with a browser-based interface for domain experts. Features include no need for local hardware upgrades, zero production downtime during maintenance, and a human-in-the-loop to adjust model parameters and maintain trust.

Result: Conceptual framework with claimed benefits: reduced financial and operational risks, scalable and accessible pathway, improved production quality and safety, and strengthened competitive advantage in manufacturing. No empirical results provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, practical route for ML deployment in manufacturing, emphasizing accessibility and trust via human-in-the-loop control and API-based decoupling to minimize downtime and integration challenges.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

Motivation: PU learning lacks standardized evaluation protocols, leading to inconsistent experimental setups and biased comparisons. There is a need for realistic, fair benchmarking that accounts for fundamental differences across PU problem families.

Method: Identify critical factors affecting fair PU evaluation; propose PU-friendly model selection criteria; analyze one-sample vs two-sample settings and diagnose internal label shift in unlabeled data; propose a calibration approach to enable fair cross-family comparisons; present a benchmarking framework.

Result: Proposes a realistic, accessible benchmarking framework for PU learning along with a calibration method, clarifying evaluation protocols and enabling fair comparisons across methods and problem settings.

Conclusion: The benchmark and calibration strategy aim to establish realistic, fair PU-learning evaluation as a standard practice and help unify future research.

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

### [555] [ChessArena: A Chess Testbed for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24239)
*Jincheng Liu,Sijun He,Jingjing Wu,Xiangsen Wang,Yang Chen,Zhaoqi Kuang,Siqi Bao,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An abstract introduces ChessArena, a chess-based benchmark to test strategic reasoning in LLMs by having them compete under four modes; it evaluates 13 LLMs across 800 games, revealing current LLMs lag behind a human amateur-level engine Maia-1100, with a strong baseline achieved by fine-tuned Qwen3-8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs demonstrate genuine strategic reasoning or primarily recognize patterns from training data, using chess as a domain that requires long-term planning, rule comprehension, and memory across turns.

Method: A competitive testbed, ChessArena, where LLMs play each other under four play modes, with a ranking algorithm and leaderboard. It evaluates fine-grained capabilities (basic understanding, move selection, puzzle solving) across 13 LLMs in 800 games, includes a random baseline and Maia-1100 as a benchmark, and presents a strong baseline via fine-tuned Qwen3-8B.

Result: No model defeats Maia-1100; some models fail to beat a random player; fine-tuned Qwen3-8B shows substantial improvement, approaching larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Conclusion: ChessArena reveals current LLMs have significant gaps in strategic reasoning; while targeted fine-tuning can improve performance, LLMs still lag behind dedicated chess engines, indicating room for improvements in reasoning capabilities and benchmark infrastructure.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

### [556] [Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256)
*Yunhao Liang,Pujun Zhang,Yuan Qu,Shaochong Lin,Zuo-jun Max Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Foundation Model (GFM) enables universal, fast-distance optimization on graphs via self-supervised pretraining on random-walk paths, bridging LLM pretraining with graph constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend pretrain-transfer to graph-structured OR problems; address mismatch between flexible language models and strict combinatorial graph rules; create a foundational model that internalizes graph topology.

Method: Pretrain a graph-based model on paths generated by random walks; use graph connectivity as supervision; then apply a simple generative heuristic to solve diverse distance-based optimization tasks.

Result: GFM achieves competitive performance with specialized solvers across tasks on graphs of 20–893 nodes and offers significantly faster inference.

Conclusion: Introduces a new paradigm for adapting pretrain-transfer to graph optimization, enabling foundation-model-style reasoning for OR on graphs and broad applicability.

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

### [557] [Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Framework for ESP Cheater Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24274)
*Inkyu Park,Jeong-Gwan Lee,Taehwan Kwon,Juheon Choi,Seungku Kim,Junsu Kim,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A controllable simulation framework that models ESP cheats and detectors as co-adapting RL agents to study adaptive cheating and detector development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP cheats are hard to detect due to hidden information and lack of labeled data; cheaters adapt strategies to evade detectors. A controllable simulation platform is needed to study co-evolution of cheating behavior and detection.

Method: Model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different observability; use trajectory-based detectors to classify behavior; frame the interaction as an adversarial game; deploy a structured cheater model that toggles cheating based on detection risk.

Result: Demonstrates that the framework can produce adaptive cheating behaviors that balance reward optimization with detection evasion; enables co-adaptation between cheaters and detectors and provides a platform for evaluating detectors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a controllable and extensible tool for studying adaptive cheating and for developing more effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

### [558] [ELASTIQ: EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24302)
*Muyun Jiang,Shuailei Zhang,Zhenjie Yang,Mengjun Wu,Weibang Jiang,Zhiwei Guo,Wei Zhang,Rui Liu,Shangen Zhang,Yong Li,Yi Ding,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELASTIQ is a language-informed EEG foundation model that uses spectral-temporal reconstruction pretraining and instruction-conditioned Q-former alignment to text, achieving state-of-the-art on 14 of 20 EEG datasets and best average across five task categories, highlighting explicit task instructions as semantic priors for linguistically grounded EEG embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG representation learning lacks language-driven priors to leverage semantic knowledge for unifying labels and tasks; incorporating language instructions could improve robustness, transferability, and cross-task coherence of EEG embeddings.

Method: Pretraining with Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR): frequency masking plus two temporal objectives (random masking and causal masking). Instruction tuning via Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF): a query-based cross-attention transformer injecting instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligning them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. Evaluation on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion, SSVEP, covert speech, and healthcare.

Result: ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of 20 datasets and the best average across five task categories. Analyses indicate explicit task instructions act as semantic priors that steer EEG embeddings into linguistically grounded spaces. Code and pretrained weights will be released.

Conclusion: Language-conditioned EEG foundation models can unify and structure EEG representations through semantic guidance, improving robustness and transferability across diverse tasks; ELASTIQ demonstrates the feasibility and potential of language-aligned EEG learning and invites further exploration into instruction-guided neuroscience AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

*Alexander Tyurin,Andrei Spiridonov,Varvara Rudenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT for asynchronous distributed policy-gradient RL, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency; Rennala improves computational and communication complexity in homogeneous settings with AllReduce; Malenia handles asynchronous and heterogeneous environments with stronger theoretical guarantees; experiments show significant performance gains over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap in understanding and designing distributed RL algorithms under asynchronous and heterogeneous computations and communication bottlenecks, seeking efficiency gains and theoretical guarantees beyond standard non-distributed methods.

Method: Introduce two algorithms, Rennala NIGT (homogeneous setting) and Malenia NIGT (heterogeneous setting), that perform asynchronous policy-gradient aggregation. Rennala supports AllReduce and provably reduces total computational and communication complexity; Malenia extends the approach to tolerate asynchrony and heterogeneity with stronger theoretical guarantees.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art efficiency in distributed policy-gradient RL; Rennala offers improved complexity bounds with AllReduce; Malenia provides better theoretical guarantees under asynchronous/heterogeneous conditions; experiments show substantial performance improvements over prior baselines.

Conclusion: The work advances distributed RL by delivering practical and theoretically-sound asynchronous policy-gradient aggregation methods that perform well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, outperforming existing approaches in empirical evaluations.

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

### [560] [A study of Universal ODE approaches to predicting soil organic carbon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24306)
*Satyanarayana Raju G. V. V,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UDE-based SciML blends physics with neural nets to forecast Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) across depth and time; performs well under clean/moderate noise but shows overfitting and smoothing under severe noise; field deployment needs noise-aware loss and probabilistic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC prediction is hindered by intertwined physical, chemical, and biological processes; a scalable, noise-tolerant forecasting framework that integrates mechanistic physics with data-driven microbial dynamics is valuable.

Method: Scientific ML framework using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) that couple advection-diffusion physics with neural networks learning microbial production and respiration; evaluated on synthetic data with six experimental cases, introducing increasing multiplicative, spatially correlated noise (up to 35%); performance assessed via MSE and R2 across depth/time.

Result: Under noise-free and mild-noise conditions the UDE reconstructs SOC dynamics well: Case 4 (clean terminal profile at 50 years) MSE=1.6e-5, R2=0.9999; Case 5 (7% noise) MSE=3.4e-6, R2=0.99998. Under severe noise, Case 3 (35% at t=0) shows overfitting (R2=0.94) and Case 6 (35% at t=50) yields overly smooth mean profiles with negative R2, indicating limited generalization; overall, UDEs show promise for scalable, noise-tolerant SOC forecasting but require advances to handle heavy uncertainty.

Conclusion: UDEs are a promising path for scalable SOC forecasting, but field deployment requires noise-aware loss functions, probabilistic modeling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics to ensure robust performance under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

*Xianhang Li,Chen Huang,Chun-Liang Li,Eran Malach,Josh Susskind,Vimal Thilak,Etai Littwin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT replaces EMA-based teacher-student distillation (V-JEPA) with a frozen teacher architecture. Train a target encoder via pixel reconstruction, freeze it, and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions, yielding a two-stage, unregularized scheme that improves transparency, efficiency, and scalability while maintaining strong generalization under frozen evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  EMA-based self-distillation in video representation learning couples teacher and student and complicates model selection. The work seeks a simpler, scalable alternative that decouples optimization, enabling easier computation budgeting and broader applicability.

Method: Two-stage approach: (i) train a target encoder using a pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking; (ii) freeze the encoder and train a student to predict the teacher's latent representations for masked regions. This yields a static-teacher asymmetric latent-training regime (SALT).

Result: SALT-trained student models outperform recent V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks, with higher probe accuracy at matched FLOPs. SALT's scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy–FLOPs frontier, and student quality is robust to teacher quality (even sub-optimal teachers yield strong students).

Conclusion: SALT is a simple, scalable, compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning, preserving generalization while improving transparency and efficiency.

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

### [562] [AuON: A Linear-time Alternative to Semi-Orthogonal Momentum Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24320)
*Dipan Maity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AuON is a linear-time momentum-based optimizer that preserves directional information without explicit semi-orthogonalization, delivering competitive results to AdamW and Muon, with a hybrid variant using one Newton-Schulz iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthogonal gradient updates can improve optimization but are computationally expensive (O(n^3) via SVD/QR). While momentum-based methods like Muon mitigate cost by applying momentum before orthogonalization and using Newton-Schulz for semi-orthogonal matrices (reducing to O(n^2)), quadratic costs remain a bottleneck. There is a need for scalable optimizers that preserve directional information without heavy matrix factorization.

Method: Introduce AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that avoids constructing semi-orthogonal matrices. AuON uses hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization and bounds momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region to preserve directional information. A hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) applies a single Newton-Schulz iteration. The approach aims to maintain alignment and recondition ill-posed updates while achieving linear-time complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks show AuON and Hybrid-AuON achieve performance comparable to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon. The paper claims computational efficiency improvements over Newton-Schulz-based semi-orthogonalization.

Conclusion: AuON offers a linear-time alternative to semi-orthogonalization-based momentum updates, preserving directional information and achieving competitive performance with established optimizers. The hybrid variant provides a middle ground by incorporating a single Newton-Schulz iteration.

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

### [563] [H+: An Efficient Similarity-Aware Aggregation for Byzantine Resilient Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24330)
*Shiyuan Zuo,Rongfei Fan,Cheng Zhan,Jie Xu,Puning Zhao,Han Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H+ is a similarity-aware FL aggregation method that works with or without clean data by sampling r-dimensional segments of client updates, comparing them to a reference vector via a similarity function, and aggregating the most similar clients. Repeated K times yields robust identification of honest clients with complexity O(K M r) (Kr ≪ p). It achieves state-of-the-art robustness against Byzantine attacks across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks. Existing similarity-based defenses rely on clean data; when clean data is unavailable, their applicability suffers. There is a need for a similarity-aware aggregation method that operates without clean data while maintaining robustness.

Method: H+ randomly selects r-dimensional segments from each M client’s p-dimensional parameter vector, uses a similarity function H to compare each segment against a reference vector, and retains the most similar client vectors for aggregation. The reference vector is derived from either existing robust algorithms (when clean data is unavailable) or directly from clean data. The process is repeated K times to reliably identify honest clients. Computational complexity is O(K M r) with Kr ≪ p.

Result: Empirical evaluations show H+ achieves state-of-the-art robustness, outperforming existing methods across varying Byzantine attack ratios and multiple attack types on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: H+ extends similarity-aware aggregation to FL even without clean data, delivering strong robustness with low computational cost and broad applicability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

*Siyang Li,Yize Chen,Yan Guo,Ming Huang,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces iMOOE, a physics-guided invariant learning method for PDE forecasting that achieves zero-shot OOD generalization via an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert and a frequency-enriched invariant objective; demonstrates strong in-distribution and zero-shot OOD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based PDE forecasters struggle to generalize to unseen PDE system parameters without test-time adaptation; fundamental PDE invariances are underexplored in current models, hindering zero-shot generalization across domains and evolution.

Method: Propose two-fold PDE invariance: (1) invariance of ingredient operators across domains; (2) invariance of their composition relationships. Build iMOOE with an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Experts architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective to enforce these invariances during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks and real-world applications show superior in-distribution forecasting and zero-shot generalization to diverse OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: Physics-guided invariance constraints coupled with a modular operator-expert model enable robust zero-shot OOD generalization for PDE dynamics forecasting; highlights potential for broader physics-informed forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

*Qingquan Zhang,Ziqi Wang,Yuchen Li,Keyuan Zhang,Bo Yuan,Jialin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-objective learning framework for diverse game level generation by treating multiple diversity metrics as objectives; uses a multi-objective evolutionary learning process to optimize several metrics during training, yielding a Pareto front of generators that balance playability with content- and player-centered diversity, demonstrated on Super Mario Bros.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diversity in game levels is multi-dimensional and conflicting; existing methods struggle to assess and optimize across multiple diversity aspects; need an approach that jointly optimizes several diversity metrics during model training to better support diverse player and designer needs.

Method: Formulate level generation training as a multi-objective optimization problem, with each diversity metric as an objective; introduce a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimizes across multiple metrics concurrently during training; case study on Super Mario Bros. to evaluate performance and Pareto front.

Result: The framework enhances multi-dimensional diversity and yields a Pareto front of generative models, offering tradeoffs between playability and two representative diversity metrics (content-based and player-centered); enables decision-makers to select generators for various scenarios and needs.

Conclusion: Multi-objective diversity-aware training expands horizons of level generation, providing a principled way to balance multiple diversity dimensions and supports informed generator selection for different design goals and players.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

### [566] [Watermarking Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368)
*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First diffusion-language-model watermark; high detection rate (>99%) with minimal quality loss; robustness comparable to ARLM watermarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARLM watermark methods rely on previous tokens; diffusion LMs generate tokens in arbitrary order, so a non-autoregressive watermarking approach is needed that works with uncertain context while preserving detector compatibility.

Method: Embed watermark by taking expectation over the partially known context (unknown future tokens) and bias the choice of tokens toward those that increase watermark strength when used as context for subsequent tokens; detector unchanged.

Result: Achieves >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact; robustness comparable to ARLM watermarks; enables reliable DLM watermarking.

Conclusion: Presents a viable, robust watermarking scheme for diffusion language models, filling a key gap and enabling practical detection of machine-generated content from DLMs.

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

### [567] [Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24372)
*Xin Qiu,Yulu Gan,Conor F. Hayes,Qiyao Liang,Elliot Meyerson,Babak Hodjat,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evolution strategies (ES) can scale to fine-tune full large language models (LLMs) and outperform reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning on several fronts, suggesting ES as a viable alternative for large-scale LLM customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been the dominant fine-tuning method for LLMs, but scalability concerns and perceived inefficiencies led to neglect of alternative approaches like ES. This work seeks to demonstrate that ES can effectively optimize billions of parameters and offer advantages over RL.

Method: Apply evolution strategies to fine-tune all parameters of full-size LLMs, conduct systematic comparisons with RL-based fine-tuning across multiple models and tasks, and evaluate metrics such as sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, vulnerability to reward hacking, and stability across runs.

Result: ES-based fine-tuning can efficiently search over billions of parameters and, in experiments, outperforms existing RL fine-tuning methods in terms of sample efficiency, handling long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base models, reduced reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs.

Conclusion: ES provides a new direction for LLM fine-tuning beyond RL, enabling scalable, robust optimization of full-model parameters; the authors release source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

### [568] [AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS is a framework that enables a frozen LLM to explain time-series anomaly detection by adding three grounding hints: a symbolic numeric cue, a context-aware, step-aligned representation from a pretrained TS encoder, and a task-prior hint capturing global anomaly traits. It also introduces a new benchmark for multi-format questions and rationales. The results show improved explanation quality and competitive detection accuracy against strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series anomaly explanations should reveal not just detection, but the pattern and rationale. However, using direct time-to-text serialization fails to ground long, continuous signals in discrete tokens, limiting explainability. A method that grounds LLMs in time-series context is needed.

Method:  AXIS augments a frozen LLM with three hints: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for grounding numerical values, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint encoding global anomaly characteristics. It also introduces a benchmarking suite with multi-format questions and rationales to supervise contextual grounding and pattern semantics, and evaluates both LLM-based and human explanations against various baselines.

Result: Experiments show AXIS produces explanations of significantly higher quality and yields competitive detection accuracy compared with general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: Structured grounding enables frozen LLMs to perform nuanced time-series understanding for explainable TSAD, with improved explanation quality and robust benchmarking establishing the method's effectiveness across baselines.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

### [569] [Muon: Training and Trade-offs with Latent Attention and MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24406)
*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer enables efficient transformer training with small-to-medium decoders, offering convergence guarantees and spectral regularization; achieves substantial compute savings and memory/tempo improvements, combining well with MLA and MoE; acts as robust alternative to AdamW with large-batch training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in training large transformers and the trade-off between compute, memory, and performance. Extend prior scalability results to formal theory and practical guidelines for Muon's integration with modern efficiency techniques.

Method: Theoretical analysis: convergence rate under standard assumptions; spectral regularization preventing gradient explosion; connection to natural gradient on Stiefel; equivalence to steepest gradient under spectral norm. Empirical: verify Pareto frontier with large batch sizes; report training compute reduction (48-52%) and final perplexity; study synergy with MLA and MoE giving 68% memory reduction and 3.2x speedup; stability analyses over 100+ runs; provide guidelines including Newton-Schulz coefficients.

Result: Muon reaches target loss using 48-52% of AdamW's training compute and maintains/improves perplexity; MLA+MoE+Muon yields 68% memory reduction and 3.2x speedup with perplexity gains of 8-12%. Demonstrates broad empirical support across 15 components and 100+ runs.

Conclusion: Muon is a principled, robust alternative to AdamW, particularly effective with modern efficiency techniques and large-batch training, expanding the compute-time Pareto frontier.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

### [570] [ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414)
*Tao Yin,Xiaohong Zhang,Shaochen Fu,Zhibin Zhang,Li Huang,Yiyuan Yang,Kaixiang Yang,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScatterAD introduces representation scattering to multivariate time series anomaly detection by jointly modeling temporal and topological (graph-structured) dispersions, using a temporal encoder, a topological encoder, and a contrastive fusion mechanism, underpinned by a conditional mutual information rationale. It achieves state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IoT time series exhibit complex spatio-temporal couplings and high-dimensional dispersion, especially for anomalies. Traditional methods model spatial or temporal dependencies separately, leading to suboptimal detection. The paper formalizes dispersion (scattering) and leverages it as a signal to improve anomaly detection.

Method: Propose ScatterAD with (1) a topological encoder to capture graph-structured scattering, (2) a temporal encoder that constrains over-scattering via mean squared error between neighboring time steps, (3) a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure complementarity of temporal and topological representations, (4) a theoretical component showing that maximizing conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and discriminativeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection; code is released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: ScatterAD effectively leverages representation scattering to enhance anomaly detection by jointly modeling temporal and topological dispersion, supported by theoretical justification and empirical evidence; it offers a scalable and performant approach for industrial IoT time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

### [571] [BiHDTrans: binary hyperdimensional transformer for efficient multivariate time series classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24425)
*Jingtao Zhang,Yi Liu,Qi Shen,Changhong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiHDTrans unifies binary hyperdimensional computing with Transformer-style self-attention to enable accurate, low-latency multivariate time series classification on resource-constrained edge devices, achieving superior accuracy and dramatically lower FPGA latency than state-of-the-art HD and binary Transformers, while remaining robust to dimensionality reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT edge devices generate large volumes of multivariate time series data, requiring efficient, accurate processing under tight resource constraints. HD computing offers efficiency but struggles with temporal patterns; Transformers supply strong sequence modeling but are computationally heavy. There is a need for a representation that combines expressiveness with efficiency for edge MTS tasks.

Method: Introduce BiHDTrans, a neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that injects self-attention into the HD computing framework. The model leverages binary/HD representations and a pipeline-friendly FPGA implementation that exploits the i.i.d. properties of high-dimensional vectors for fast inference. It fuses temporal modeling from Transformers with the representational efficiency and parallelism of HD computing, and demonstrates robustness under substantial dimensionality reduction (up to 64%).

Result: BiHDTrans achieves at least 14.47% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art HD models and 6.67% higher than state-of-the-art binary Transformers on average. FPGA-based hardware acceleration yields 39.4x lower inference latency than SOTA binary Transformers. The authors provide theoretical justification that binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space incurs less information distortion than binarizing conventional neural networks. Dimensionality experiments show competitive accuracy with 64% reduced hyperspace dimensionality, with 1-2% higher accuracy than SOTA binary Transformers, while achieving 4.4x smaller model size and 49.8% lower latency compared to the full-dimensional baseline.

Conclusion: BiHDTrans effectively bridges the expressiveness gap between Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, delivering accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification on resource-constrained edge devices, and offering a viable path toward practical neurosymbolic AI for IoT.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

### [572] [Semantic Compression via Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24431)
*Eleonora Grassucci,Giordano Cicchetti,Aurelio Uncini,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reducing modality gap in multimodal embeddings enables semantic compression by replacing multiple modality-specific embeddings with a shared centroid, achieving memory savings with preserved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional multimodal embeddings strain storage and downstream processing; aligning modalities creates a shared semantic space that makes compression feasible.

Method: Proposes a compression framework that operates on pretrained encoders, leveraging the reduced modality gap so that embeddings expressing the same concept across modalities share a centroid; replaces modality-specific representations with centroids to compress.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse large-scale multimodal tasks shows substantial memory savings with negligible or no loss in performance, underscoring modality alignment as a key enabler.

Conclusion: Semantic compression is feasible when modality alignment reduces cross-modal gaps; the proposed centroid-based approach enables effective post-training compression without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

### [573] [EOE: Evolutionary Optimization of Experts for Training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24436)
*Yingshi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An evolutionary framework trains LLMs by partitioning the model into expert sub-networks; only one expert is trained at a time. After AdamW optimization, evolutionary operators (crossover, PSO, mutation) adjust weights toward the best expert, and only the best expert is saved. The best expert approaches full-model accuracy with significantly reduced memory and over 10x throughput, with a pure C++/CUDA implementation enabling PC/edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce training memory, cost, and inference size for large language models by sharing knowledge across expert sub-networks and transferring improvements via evolutionary operators, aiming for near full-model performance with much smaller, faster models suitable for edge devices.

Method: Divide the LLM into multiple identical-structure experts with different parameters. Train only one expert per step using AdamW. After optimization, apply evolutionary operators (crossover, PSO, mutation) on the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert to transfer the best’s experience. The current expert updates toward the best; finally, only the best expert’s weights are saved. Compare performance against the full model. Implemented in pure C++/CUDA for deployment on PCs and edge devices.

Result: Empirically, the best expert attains nearly the same accuracy as the full model, while requiring far less memory and delivering over tenfold throughput improvements during training. The framework claims notable efficiency gains and practical deployment benefits, supported by publicly available source code.

Conclusion: An evolutionary-expert framework can deliver competitive accuracy with substantially reduced model size and dramatically higher throughput, enabling efficient training and edge deployment of LLMs. Further work could explore stability, scalability across larger expert counts, and comparison to other model compression/training techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

*Zifan Wang,Xinlei Yi,Xenia Konti,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributionally robust federated learning framework using unbalanced Wasserstein distance with KL penalties to mitigate outliers, solved via a tractable Lagrangian reformulation and a decentralized algorithm with convergence guarantees and robustness certificates, validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning performance deteriorates under distributional perturbations; standard DRO improves robustness but often ignores the adverse impact of local outliers, which can bias models. There is a need for an outlier-resilient DRO approach in FL.

Method: Introduce an ambiguity set based on unbalanced Wasserstein distance augmented with a non-geometric KL penalty to suppress outliers. This yields a min–max–max problem, which is reformulated as a tractable Lagrangian penalty problem enabling decentralized optimization. The framework provides robustness certificates and a practical algorithm for distributed training.

Result: The method comes with convergence guarantees and comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating effective outlier-robust performance and improved resilience to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: We present a principled, outlier-resilient distributionally robust federated learning framework with provable guarantees and empirically validated robustness against data distribution perturbations and local outliers.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Maedeh Zarvandi,Michael Timothy,Theresa Wasserer,Debarghya Ghoshdastidar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable kernel-based representation learning framework (KREPES) using Nyström approximation for unsupervised/self-supervised learning with interpretable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel methods offer strong theory but scale poorly; there is no scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning on massive unlabeled data, limiting interpretability advantages vs. deep models.

Method: Propose KREPES, a unified framework leveraging Nyström approximation to scale kernel representations and support a broad set of unsupervised and self-supervised losses.

Result: Large-scale experiments on image and tabular data show efficiency gains; representations learned via KREPES are interpretable, with dedicated analysis supporting interpretability.

Conclusion: KREPES enables scalable, interpretable kernel-based representation learning, extending kernel methods into large-scale, self-supervised representation learning and offering principled interpretability over deep models.

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FS-KAN generalizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to arbitrary permutation symmetries using Function Sharing, unifying and extending equivariant/invariant KA layers; it preserves expressivity while enhancing data efficiency, especially in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no principled framework for applying equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to data with permutation symmetries in a general setting; a unified, interpretable, and data-efficient approach is needed.

Method: Generalize parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold framework to construct Function Sharing KA (FS-KAN) layers that are equivariant or invariant to arbitrary permutation groups; provide theoretical results showing FS-KANs have the same expressive power as standard parameter-sharing networks and derive the layer construction; perform empirical evaluations across multiple data types and symmetry groups.

Result: FS-KANs demonstrate superior data efficiency compared to standard parameter-sharing layers across several data types and symmetry groups, with larger gains in some cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KA-based architectures in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: FS-KAN provides a principled framework for permutation-symmetric KA layers that matches the expressivity of standard PS networks, extends and unifies prior work, and offers improved data efficiency, particularly in low-data settings.

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

*Minh Le,Bao-Ngoc Dao,Huy Nguyen,Quyen Tran,Anh Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMoPE introduces a sparse MoE-based prompt architecture for continual learning, balancing task-specific and shared prompts to improve efficiency and reduce interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce memory and computation of per-task prompts while mitigating knowledge interference across tasks, by leveraging mixture-of-experts within a shared prompt framework.

Method: A shared prompt is decomposed into multiple prompt experts arranged in a sparse MoE. For each input, an attention-based scoring aggregator selects a small subset of experts. An adaptive noise mechanism balances expert usage. A prototype-based loss using prefix keys acts as implicit memory. Training spans multiple tasks in continual learning.

Result: SMoPE outperforms task-specific prompt baselines and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing parameter counts and computational cost.

Conclusion: Integrating MoE-like sparsity with prompt-based continual learning yields efficient, scalable performance, with dynamic expert activation and memory-inspired regularization enhancing specialization and reducing interference.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific

### [578] [Guided Uncertainty Learning Using a Post-Hoc Evidential Meta-Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24492)
*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE is a lightweight, post-hoc meta-model that attaches to a frozen base model to learn when and how to be uncertain, improving reliability under distributional shift without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification under distributional shift remains unreliable; existing post-hoc approaches either miscalibrate or only reshape predictions. A method is needed to actively teach uncertainty.

Method: Identify salient internal features via a calibration stage, then construct a noise-driven curriculum that trains the model to express uncertainty at appropriate times. The approach attaches to a frozen base model, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and avoids manual layer selection.

Result: Out-of-distribution detection improved by ~77%; adversarial attack detection improved by ~80%; preserves in-distribution performance; consistently outperforms state-of-the-art across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Actively guiding uncertainty bridges the gap between predictive confidence and reliability; GUIDE offers broad applicability with minimal user intervention.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

### [579] [LLM DNA: Tracing Model Evolution via Functional Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24496)
*Zhaomin Wu,Haodong Zhao,Ziyang Wang,Jizhou Guo,Qian Wang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM DNA: a training-free, bi-Lipschitz, low-dimensional embedding of LLM functional behavior; builds an evolutionary phylogeny over 305 LLMs revealing relationships and architecture-driven evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLMs creates an opaque landscape with undocumented lineage; existing methods are task-specific and assumption-bound. A scalable, architecture-agnostic way to compare models and trace their evolution is needed.

Method: Define LLM DNA as a low-dimensional bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior; prove inheritance and genetic determinism; establish existence; derive a training-free DNA extraction pipeline; apply to 305 LLMs; construct evolutionary trees via phylogenetic algorithms; analyze alignment with architectural shifts and temporal progression; assess evolutionary speeds.

Result: DNA aligns with prior subset studies and achieves competitive or superior task performance on certain benchmarks; reveals previously undocumented relationships; evolutionary trees reflect encoder-decoder shifts, temporal trends, and varied evolution speeds across LLM families.

Conclusion: DNA offers a scalable, interpretable framework for characterizing LLMs and their evolution, enabling better management, taxonomy, and discovery of hidden relationships among models.

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

### [580] [Specialization after Generalization: Towards Understanding Test-Time Training in Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24510)
*Jonas Hübotter,Patrik Wolf,Alexander Shevchenko,Dennis Jüni,Andreas Krause,Gil Kur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-time training (TTT) can enable foundation models to specialize after generalization, improving in-distribution performance by focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. The authors propose a linear representation hypothesis and validate it with a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, then scale analyses across vision and language tasks to identify regimes where specialization is most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and when TTT is effective in large, largely in-distribution data settings, moving beyond explanations based on out-of-distribution adaptation or privileged data.

Method: Propose a model under a linear representation hypothesis in which TTT reduces in-distribution error more than global training. Validate assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet to show that semantically related data points are explained by few shared concepts. Conduct scaling studies across image and language tasks to identify regimes where specialization via TTT is most impactful.

Result: The model predicts significantly lower in-distribution test error with TTT compared to global training. Empirical validation with a sparse autoencoder shows that diverse data points share a small set of concepts. Scaling studies corroborate the practical implications, outlining regimes where specialization yields the most benefit.

Conclusion: TTT acts as a mechanism for specialization after generalization in underparameterized foundation models, enabling focused learning on test-task concepts. The linear representation framework and empirical demonstrations delineate regimes where specialization is most effective and scalable across modalities.

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

*Sophia N. Wilson,Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen,Raghavendra Selvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Embedding physics inductive biases in spatio-temporal forecasting can substantially improve efficiency (compute, energy, carbon) while maintaining or improving accuracy, suggesting a shift to consider model efficiency alongside efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the environmental and resource costs of efficacy-driven ML (large models with high carbon footprints) by leveraging physics-inspired priors to trade off accuracy for efficiency.

Method: Empirical study across spatio-temporal forecasting models, comparing standard physics-informed designs with modern approaches like flow matching, and evaluating both accuracy and efficiency metrics (compute, energy, carbon footprint).

Result: Physics inductive biases yield substantial efficiency gains with retained/improved efficacy; flow matching emerges as a general-purpose, effective method for spatio-temporal forecasting; overall, efficiency gains come with little to no loss in performance and reduced carbon impact.

Conclusion: Model efficiency should be a core consideration in ML design and deployment, with physics-informed biases offering a principled route to reduce resource use and carbon footprint without sacrificing efficacy.

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

### [582] [LEAF: A Robust Expert-Based Framework for Few-Shot Continual Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24547)
*Bao-Ngoc Dao,Quang Nguyen,Luyen Ngo Dinh,Minh Le,Linh Ngo Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAF is an expert-based FCED framework that uses a mixture of experts with LoRA adapters, semantic-aware expert routing, label-description guided contrastive learning, and knowledge distillation to achieve state-of-the-art few-shot continual event detection while mitigating forgetting and avoiding risky data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCED faces two core challenges: learning from very limited labeled data per task and severe forgetting across sequential tasks when fine-tuning a shared model. Existing augmentation strategies can distort semantics. LEAF aims to reduce interference by specialized experts and improve generalization with semantic guidance and distillation.

Method: Integrate a mixture-of-experts architecture where each expert is parameterized with LoRA in the base model. A semantic-aware routing mechanism selects relevant experts for each instance. Employ a label-description guided contrastive objective to capture high-level semantic information of event types. Use knowledge distillation from previous models to prevent overfitting on the memory buffer and to preserve prior knowledge across tasks. Evaluate on multiple FCED benchmarks to demonstrate robustness and SOTA performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FCED benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of expert specialization, LoRA adapters, semantic routing, and distillation in few-shot continual event detection.

Conclusion: LEAF demonstrates that an expert-based approach with lightweight adapters and semantic guidance can effectively tackle FCED, reducing knowledge interference and improving generalization in limited-data, continual settings. The framework offers a promising direction for robust continual learning in event detection and related tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Eleonora Grassucci,Giuliano Galadini,Giordano Cicchetti,Aurelio Uncini,Fabio Antonacci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free multimodal guidance mechanism (MDG) improves video-to-audio diffusion by aligning video, audio, and text embeddings without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods rely on costly joint training on paired data or pairwise similarities, which may fail to capture global, multimodal coherence across modalities.

Method: Introduce multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG), a lightweight, training-free control signal that leverages the volume spanned by modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text. MDG is plug-and-play on top of any pretrained audio diffusion model without retraining.

Result: MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and multimodal alignment on VGGSound and AudioCaps compared with baselines.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal guidance for V2A is effective; MDG provides a practical, training-free approach to improve diffusion-based V2A with cross-modal coherence.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWAX with stochastic window sizes improves both short- and long-context performance over fixed-window attention by combining sliding-window softmax attention with xLSTM memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how window length and the interaction between sliding-window softmax attention and linear RNNs affect performance, and to address the under-studied interplay in hybrid architectures.

Method: Introduce SWAX, a hybrid of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers; train with stochastic (varying) sliding window sizes; evaluate on short- and long-context tasks.

Result: SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes significantly outperforms regular window attention on both short- and long-context problems.

Conclusion: Window length effects are nuanced: smaller windows can fortify long-context memory by reducing reliance on softmax attention, and stochastic window training enables leveraging both longer context and xLSTM memory, yielding strong cross-context performance.

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

### [585] [Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action: Real-Time Control of Vortex-Induced Vibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24556)
*Hussam Sababha,Bernat Font,Mohammed Daqaq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Experimental real-time deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control of vortex-induced vibrations on a circular cylinder at Re=3000 using rotary actuation. It handles actuator delay and demonstrates strong suppression: up to ~80% with state feedback (low-frequency/lock-on) and >95% with a history-augmented controller that compensates for delay by enabling high-frequency actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrate the viability of DRL-based active flow control in real-world, high-Reynolds-number experiments and address practical limitations such as actuation delay, extending beyond prior low-Reynolds-number simulations.

Method: Experimental setup: circular cylinder in a flow at Re=3000 with rotary (torque) actuation. A DRL agent receives state feedback (cylinder displacement and velocity) and learns a control policy in real time. Comparisons are made between (i) state-feedback-only, which yields a low-frequency control leveraging lock-on, and (ii) including past control actions in the observation to mitigate delays, enabling a high-frequency control strategy.

Result: With state feedback alone, the agent achieves up to 80% vibration suppression via a low-frequency strategy. Actuation delays limit performance. Incorporating past control actions to compensate for lag enables a high-frequency strategy that delivers >95% vibration attenuation.

Conclusion: DRL-based AFC can be effectively deployed in real-world experimental setups at high Re, capable of overcoming actuator lag; enriching the observation with action history enables high-frequency strategies that significantly improve performance, illustrating the practical viability of DRL for AFC in real environments.

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

*Marco Molinari,Leonardo Nevali,Saharsha Navani,Omar G. Younis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VLAs implicitly encode latent world models, as transition vectors between states are recoverable from intermediate activations in OpenVLA, outperforming simple embeddings as baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether policy-trained vision-language-action models learn environment dynamics (world models), bridging model-based RL concepts with VLAs.

Method: Compute state transition vectors from sequential environment states. Train linear and nonlinear probes on OpenVLA activations across layers to predict these transitions. Compare performance to baselines (state embeddings). Analyze a previous OpenVLA checkpoint and outline a Sparse Autoencoder pipeline to further study the latent dynamics.

Result: Probes achieve statistically significant predictive accuracy on state transitions beyond baselines, indicating an internal world model. Evidence strengthens as training progresses; earlier checkpoint shows hints of emergence. A Sparse Autoencoder–based pipeline is proposed for deeper analysis.

Conclusion: OpenVLA encodes an internal world model rather than relying solely on policy-based behavior. The proposed methodology provides evidence of latent dynamics and offers a path for deeper architectural analysis using SAEs.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

*Yusuf Guven,Vincenzo Di Vito,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-network learning framework for PDE-constrained optimization that uses a dynamic neural-operator predictor for PDE trajectories and a proxy-optimizer surrogate for decision variables, achieving near-optimal solutions with large speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE-constrained optimization is computationally heavy due to high-dimensional discretization and tightly coupled state/control dynamics; real-time decision making is challenging.

Method: Two-network design: a time-discrete Neural Operator (dynamic predictor) to efficiently approximate PDE trajectories; an optimization surrogate using proxy optimizer techniques to approximate optimal controls given predicted trajectories; integrates coupling between decisions and dynamics.

Result: Validated on Burgers', heat, and voltage regulation benchmarks; performance comparable to Direct Method and MPC in solution quality, with up to 10^4× faster computation.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time approximate optimal strategies for PDE-constrained problems while preserving state-control coupling; promising for applications needing fast re-planning and control.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play module (SAIP) adaptively refines the prior/likelihood scale at each diffusion step for inverse problems, improving reconstruction quality without retraining or changing the diffusion backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, manually-tuned scales balancing prior and likelihood are suboptimal because the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, hurting performance and generalization in diffusion-based inverse problems.

Method: SAIP is a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep during sampling, without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone, and can be integrated into existing samplers.

Result: SAIP consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios, when integrated with existing diffusion-based samplers.

Conclusion: Adaptive, per-timestep scale refinement via SAIP is effective for diffusion-model-based inverse problems, providing improved performance and generalization without additional training.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

*Jae-Bum Seo,Muhammad Salman,Lismer Andres Caceres-Najarro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CURA is a compact, generalizable on-device AI architecture inspired by analog audio circuits, achieving strong performance across regression, classification, NLP, and vision with dramatically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device AI in resource-constrained environments suffers from both non-compact parameter growth and poor cross-domain generalizability. There is a need for an architecture that remains small yet adapts across tasks.

Method: CURA adopts an analog-circuit-inspired architecture designed for compactness and cross-domain applicability. It emphasizes three advantages: compactness (fewer parameters for a given task), generalizability (works across regression, classification, NLP, and vision), and capability to capture complex patterns with low model complexity. The authors validate CURA on diverse datasets and domains.

Result: CURA achieves up to 2,500x fewer parameters than baselines for equivalent accuracy; across four NLP benchmarks and a vision dataset it nearly matches specialized models (F1 up to 90%); for forecasting complex patterns it achieves 1.6x lower MAE and 2.1x lower MSE than competing models.

Conclusion: CURA provides a compact, generalizable, and capable architecture for diverse on-device ML tasks, addressing both size and cross-domain performance constraints without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

### [590] [Evaluating classification performance across operating contexts: A comparison of decision curve analysis and cost curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24608)
*Louise AC Millard,Peter A Flach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision curves (DCA) and cost curves are closely related and both rely on calibrated scores; Brier curves generalize DCA and provide a consistent way to compare models across a wide range of thresholds; the two approaches select the same optimal model at any threshold, and the Brier score is the area under its curve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how decision-analytic evaluation methods (DCA and cost curves) relate, compare their strengths/limitations, and give practical guidance for evaluating predictive models under different threshold choices and calibration assumptions.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical and practical comparison between DCA and cost curves, showing their equivalence under calibrated scores and a fixed threshold-value mapping. It demonstrates the relationship to Brier curves, discusses the interpretation of reference lines, and introduces the upper envelope decision curve as a tool to illustrate potential gains from recalibration.

Result: DCA and Brier curves are closely linked: they imply the same optimal model at any threshold; Brier curves are more general and their area equals the Brier score; net benefit and Brier loss align on model choice across thresholds; reference lines can be used in either space; the upper envelope decision curve helps quantify gains from recalibration.

Conclusion: For model evaluation across decision thresholds, Brier curves offer a broader, more general framework than DCA, while DCA can be viewed as a specific case of the Brier-curve framework. Recalibration can be assessed via the upper envelope of the decision curve to understand potential improvements.

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Motivation: Address the fundamental gradient-level conflicts when aligning LLMs to multiple human preferences (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, truthfulness). Prior constraint-based and data-selection methods do not resolve parameter-level trade-offs.

Method: Decompose parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces so updates for different preferences occur in non-interfering directions; provide theoretical guarantees showing linear Lipschitz growth under orthogonality constraints and spectral norm bounds; validate with extensive experiments.

Result: Single-preference improvements range from 34.61% to 50.89% after multi-objective alignment across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions; average overall reward improvement is 13.96%.

Conclusion: OrthAlign establishes a new paradigm for resolving gradient-level conflicts in multi-objective LLM alignment, delivering stability and meaningful performance gains across objectives.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

*Katharina Friedl,Noémie Jaquier,Mika Liao,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces RO-HNN, a two-component architecture that combines a geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder for reduced-order representation with a geometric Hamiltonian neural network to model dynamics on the learned symplectic submanifold, enabling scalable, physically consistent predictions for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, physics-informed learning for high-dimensional systems by preserving Hamiltonian structure (energy/conservation) while using model-order reduction to manage dimensionality.

Method: A two-part approach: (1) a geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and (2) a geometric Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on this submanifold, ensuring the reduced dynamics retain conservation laws.

Result: Empirical results show physically consistent, stable, and generalizable predictions for complex high-dimensional dynamics, demonstrating that RO-HNN extends Hamiltonian neural networks to high-dimensional physical systems.

Conclusion: RO-HNN provides a scalable framework that preserves Hamiltonian structure via a reduced-order, geometry-aware representation, expanding the applicability of Hamiltonian neural networks to complex, high-dimensional physics problems.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

### [593] [Identity Bridge: Enabling Implicit Reasoning via Shared Latent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24653)
*Pengxiao Lin,Zheng-An Chen,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identity Bridge uses zero-hop identity supervision to align a model's latent space, enabling robust out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning. Theoretical analysis suggests implicit nuclear-norm regularization fosters low-rank, shared structure across tasks; for harder tasks, small initialization or weight decay strengthens this effect. In large models, latent memory also supports two-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit a pronounced gap in compositional, two-hop reasoning, particularly under distribution shift. A simple, effective mechanism to bridge this gap and enhance implicit reasoning is needed.

Method: Introduce Identity Bridge by supervising a zero-hop identity task. Provide empirical evidence that this facilitates out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning. Conduct a theoretical analysis with a simplified Emb-MLP model showing identity supervision reshapes latent geometry through implicit nuclear-norm regularization. Demonstrate that low-rank structure that shares across tasks emerges, and that small initialization or weight decay amplifies this effect. Extend experiments to large-scale models to observe reliance on latent memory for two-hop reasoning.

Result: Empirically, identity supervision enables models to perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning, where they previously failed. The latent geometry alignment is evidenced by the analysis, and the effect persists with large models via latent memory, although relying on different internal mechanisms.

Conclusion: Identity supervision reshapes the model’s latent space toward low-rank, cross-task structure, improving compositional reasoning and reducing generalization decay. The regularization-like effect is enhanced by initialization and weight decay for tougher tasks. For large models, latent memory provides a pathway to retain two-hop reasoning capabilities and inspires further improvements in implicit reasoning.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

### [594] [HyperHELM: Hyperbolic Hierarchy Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24655)
*Max van Spengler,Artem Moskalev,Tommaso Mansi,Mangal Prakash,Rui Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperHELM introduces masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA, using a hybrid hyperbolic-Euclidean backbone to better capture hierarchical biology; it improves across tasks and generalizes to long/low-GC sequences, outperforming Euclidean baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological sequences exhibit hierarchical structure (e.g., mRNA to amino acids); Euclidean embeddings may fail to capture such hierarchy. Hyperbolic geometry is known to naturally model hierarchical relationships, suggesting potential gains for language modeling of biological sequences.

Method: A hybrid model with hyperbolic layers atop a Euclidean backbone for masked language modeling on mRNA sequences. The hyperbolic component aligns representations with biological hierarchies (mRNA→amino acids). Pre-training is conducted across multiple species/datasets. Evaluations cover property prediction tasks and antibody region annotation, including out-of-distribution scenarios.

Result: HyperHELM outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 of 10 tasks (average ~10% improvement) for property prediction and shows superior out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences. In antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by ~3% accuracy.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a beneficial inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA, improving performance and generalization over Euclidean baselines.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

*Zikun Qu,Min Zhang,Mingze Kong,Xiang Li,Zhiwei Shang,Zhiyong Wang,Yikun Ban,Shuang Qiu,Yao Shu,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method called T-POP personalizes LLMs at test time using online pairwise preference feedback and dueling bandits to steer decoding of a frozen model, achieving rapid, data-efficient personalization without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the cold-start problem in personalizing LLMs, which typically requires slow fine-tuning or substantial pre-existing user data.

Method: Learn an online reward function from user pairwise preferences; apply test-time alignment on a frozen LLM; use dueling bandits to select queries and balance exploration/exploitation during generation.

Result: T-POP yields rapid, data-efficient personalization and outperforms baselines; benefits grow with more user interactions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective real-time, data-efficient personalization without updating model parameters, offering practical solution to user-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

### [596] [FedPOB: Sample-Efficient Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24701)
*Pingchen Lu,Zhi Hong,Zhiwei Shang,Zhiyong Wang,Yikun Ban,Yao Shu,Min Zhang,Shuang Qiu,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated, sample-efficient prompt optimization for black-box LLMs using multi-armed bandits; introduces FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref for collaborative, privacy-preserving learning with theoretical gains and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt quality critically affects LLM performance; real-world use is hampered by black-box LLMs, high query costs, and privacy concerns across users; federated MAB offers a solution that is black-box friendly, sample-efficient, and privacy-preserving.

Method: FedPOB extends Linear UCB to a federated setting where agents share model parameters rather than raw data; FedPOB-Pref handles comparative feedback via federated dueling bandits.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over baselines; performance improves with more participating agents; demonstrates sample efficiency and privacy-preserving collaboration with theoretical benefit guarantees.

Conclusion: Federated prompt optimization via bandits is effective for black-box, cost-sensitive, and privacy-aware settings and opens paths for broader application and future enhancements.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

*Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mechanistic interpretability framework (CART) for RLHF reward models to identify rare-event circuits; links circuit specialization to generalization and longtail performance; guides data augmentation, regularization, and ensembles to improve longtail robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models trained with RLHF fail systematically on long-tail distributions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment. Inspired by evidence of distributed specialization for rare events in language models, the work proposes a circuit-level view to understand and mitigate these failures.

Method: Develop a mechanistic interpretability framework to identify specialized neural circuits for rare-event processing in reward models and formalize connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. Introduce Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART), which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies.

Result: Establish formal connections between circuit specialization and generalization bounds with longtail performance. Propose CART as a practical intervention that leverages circuit analysis to improve longtail robustness. The abstract emphasizes theoretical insights and actionable training techniques rather than reported empirical results.

Conclusion: CART offers a principled, circuit-aware approach to diagnosing and mitigating longtail failures in RLHF reward models, yielding both theoretical understanding and practical training strategies to enhance longtail robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

### [598] [Q-Net: Transferable Queue Length Estimation via Kalman-based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24725)
*Ting Gao,Elvin Isufi,Winnie Daamen,Erik-Sander Smits,Serge Hoogendoorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-Net is a data-efficient, interpretable queue-length estimator for signalized intersections that fuses loop detector counts and aggregated floating car data (aFCD) using an AI-augmented Kalman filter (KalmanNet). It achieves strong RMSE improvements, handles non-conservation, and offers spatial/temporal transferability and a real-time variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Queue length estimation under partial observability and privacy-friendly data sources is challenging; there is a need for an interpretable, robust framework that works when traffic dynamics and sensor resolutions vary, without expensive cameras or radar.

Method: A tailored state-space model combined with KalmanNet that learns the Kalman gain from data, decouples measurement dimensionality from section length to enable transferability, and fuses loop counts with segment-wise aFCD speeds. The approach includes a real-time variant for queue-control integration.

Result: Q-Net outperforms baselines by over 60% RMSE on main roads in Rotterdam, accurately tracks queue formation/dissipation, mitigates aFCD delays, and demonstrates strong spatial/temporal transferability with privacy-friendly data sources and no reliance on cameras/radar.

Conclusion: Q-Net provides a data-efficient, interpretable solution for queue length estimation with robust transferability and potential for real-time traffic control integration; it advances privacy-friendly, sensor-friendly queue management.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

### [599] [Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728)
*Alessandro Manenti,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replace softmax with a hierarchical binary-split catnat for latent categorical variables; yields diagonal Fisher information, improving gradient descent efficiency; empirically boosts performance across graphs, VAEs, and reinforcement learning; simple to implement and compatible with standard training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax-based discretization suffers information-geometric limitations impacting gradient-based learning; need a discretization that facilitates learning and optimization.

Method: Introduce catnat: a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; analyze Fisher Information Matrix and show it becomes diagonal; integrate with standard training; conduct experiments on graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Catnat improves learning efficiency and yields higher test performance across tasks; simple integration and compatibility with stabilization techniques.

Conclusion: Catnat offers a simple, theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to softmax for discrete latent variables.

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep residual learning is a cornerstone of modern AI; understanding its origins and credit distribution helps scholars grasp historical progress and guides future research.

Method: Historical literature review and timeline construction: tracing pre‑ResNet ideas (e.g., skip connections/highway networks) and the development of residual blocks, followed by attribution analysis.

Result: A proposed timeline of the evolution of deep residual learning, highlighting key milestones and contributions, and clarifying that attribution spans multiple researchers rather than a single inventor, with ResNet as a pivotal milestone.

Conclusion: Attribution for residual learning is distributed across several works; the timeline clarifies the lineage from early skip/identity mappings to modern residual nets and informs future research on architectural innovations.

Abstract: Modern AI is based on deep artificial neural networks (NNs). As of 2025, the

*Giordano Cicchetti,Eleonora Grassucci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces TRIANGLE, a triangle-area similarity for triplet modality alignment, boosting three-modal learning without extra fusion layers and achieving state-of-the-art results on video-text, audio-text, and audio-video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models often rely on pairwise or cosine similarities and may not ensure all modalities are jointly aligned. There's a need for a higher-dimensional, interpretable measure that directly captures three-way alignment to improve downstream tasks.

Method: Define a triangle-area similarity computed in the embedding space spanned by the three modality embeddings; replaces cosine similarity in contrastive losses; avoids additional fusion modules; yields interpretable alignment rationales.

Result: Empirically improves across three-modal tasks; achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets; improves Recall@1 by up to 9 points over cosine-based methods; demonstrated on video-text, audio-text, audio-video tasks.

Conclusion: Triangle-area similarity is an effective and interpretable joint-alignment mechanism for tri-modal learning, offering substantial performance gains without extra fusion overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

*Longxiang He,Deheng Ye,Junbo Tan,Xueqian Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust O2O RL method (RPEX) uses inverse probability weighting to curb heavy-tailed online exploration under data corruption, achieving state-of-the-art results on corrupted O2O benchmarks like D4RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O2O RL is promising for real-world deployment but is vulnerable to noisy or malicious corruption in offline data and online interactions. Existing work emphasizes offline policy conservatism; robustness to data corruption (across states, actions, rewards, dynamics) remains underexplored. Data corruption induces heavy-tailed policy behavior, hurting exploration efficiency.

Method: Incorporate inverse probability weighting into the online exploration policy to mitigate heavy-tailedness and propose Robust Policy Expansion (RPEX).

Result: Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that RPEX achieves state-of-the-art offline-to-online performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios; code is available.

Conclusion: RPEX provides a simple yet effective approach to robust O2O RL under data corruption, with strong empirical results and practical implications for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) pretrained with amortized/in-context learning on synthetic Hawkes MTPPs to infer conditional intensity functions, enabling zero-shot or rapid fine-tuning on real data and matching specialized models on next-event prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTPP neural nets require training separate models for each target system. A universal, adaptable approach using amortized inference and in-context learning can generalize across diverse event histories and reduce per-system training. Pretraining on a broad synthetic distribution enables robust inference.

Method: Pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Training data comes from a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad Hawkes process distribution. At inference, the pretrained model estimates MTPPs from real-world data without additional training, or can be rapidly finetuned to target systems.

Result: The amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable foundation model for point-process inference, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to new target systems, with release of pretrained model resources and tutorials forthcoming online.

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

*Fabrizio Frasca,Guy Bar-Shalom,Yftah Ziser,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHARM reframes hallucination detection as a graph learning problem by encoding tokens as graph nodes, attentional flows as edges, and activation/attention features as attributes, using GNNs to unify signals and detect hallucinations. It outperforms baselines and shows promising zero-shot cross-dataset transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently produce hallucinations; existing detectors rely on heuristics over isolated traces, missing the synergistic information across signals. A unified graph-based representation can leverage multiple computational traces for better detection and generalization.

Method: From model traces, build attributed graphs: tokens are nodes, attentional flows are edges; attach features from attention scores and activations to nodes/edges. Apply graph neural networks (CHARM) to classify tokens or sequences as hallucinatory. The approach subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and demonstrates benefits of combining traces.

Result: CHARM consistently outperforms leading detection approaches across diverse benchmarks and shows promising zero-shot performance for cross-dataset transfer.

Conclusion: Graph-based integration of computational traces enhances hallucination detection; CHARM provides a principled, transferable detector and clarifies the role of graph structure in leveraging multiple signals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

TL;DR: MSM Emulators, especially Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), sample transitions across discrete MSM states to generate surrogate trajectories, achieving >100x speedups over MD and outperforming existing surrogate methods in structural statistics and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MD provides rich insights into protein function but is prohibitively expensive due to fine-grained integration and long timescales. Fixed-lag transition models bias training toward frequent, uninformative transitions and struggle to scale to large proteins. A kinetic-aware surrogate that operates on MSM-defined state transitions can dramatically accelerate sampling while preserving essential dynamical statistics.

Method: Introduce MSM Emulators and instantiate with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM). The model samples transitions between discrete MSM states rather than continuous trajectories, enabling fast, kinetically consistent sampling. Evaluation spans proteins up to ~500 residues, including unfolding events, with strict train/test sequence dissimilarity. Structural observables (RMSD, radius of gyration, secondary structure content) are used to benchmark fidelity against MD and existing surrogates.

Result: MarS-FM delivers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to MD (implicit- or explicit-solvent). Across all evaluated metrics (RMSD, radius of gyration, secondary structure content) and diverse protein domains, MarS-FM outperforms existing methods by a substantial margin, including on challenging events like unfolding and under strict test-set dissimilarity.

Conclusion: MSM Emulators, and MarS-FM in particular, offer dramatic computational acceleration for generating biomolecular trajectories while maintaining or improving agreement with MD-derived statistics. The approach scales to sizable proteins and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen sequences, representing a powerful tool for efficient biomolecular modeling.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

TL;DR: A configurable benchmark (Labyrinth) for imitation learning to assess generalization with distinct train/eval/test splits, discrete state space, known optimal actions, and variants


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

### [607] [Assessing the risk of future Dunkelflaute events for Germany using generative deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24788)
*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Downscaling CMIP6 climate simulations with a generative DL framework to assess Dunkelflaute (low wind/solar) risk in Germany; finds frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events remain largely unchanged under optimistic and high-emission scenarios, implying stable risk through the century.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Renewable energy expansion increases weather-driven variability; Dunkelflaute events threaten grid stability and must be understood in a future climate for planning and resilience.

Method: Use a generative deep learning downscaling approach to CMIP6 simulations, validate against ERA5 historical data, then project plausible future Dunkelflaute occurrences under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5.

Result: In the ensemble mean, the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany are projected to be largely unchanged compared with the historical period.

Conclusion: Under the considered climate scenarios, Dunkelflaute risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century, indicating no large increase in risk and highlighting the need for resilience planning that accounts for persistent but not escalating risk.

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

*Zhijian Xu,Wanxu Cai,Xilin Dai,Zhaorong Deng,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fidel-TS is a live-API-based benchmark for time-series forecasting that fixes data integrity, causal soundness, and structural clarity, showing that causal textual information drives genuine multimodal gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks undercut progress due to data contamination and leakage, leading to an illusion of improvement. A principled, high-fidelity benchmark is needed for trustworthy evaluation.

Method: Formulate core benchmarking principles (data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, structural clarity), construct Fidel-TS from live APIs, and run extensive experiments to compare with prior benchmarks and analyze design biases, especially regarding textual information.

Result: The study exposes critical biases and design limitations in existing benchmarks and demonstrates that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor unlocking true performance gains in multimodal forecasting.

Conclusion: High-fidelity, principled benchmarking is essential for meaningful progress in time-series forecasting; Fidel-TS shows the value of data integrity and causal text information, guiding future benchmark design.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSAT-HD: a hybrid decomposition dual-stream adaptive Transformer for time series forecasting that combines EMA-Fourier decomposition with RevIN, multi-scale sparse routing to four Transformer layers, and dual-stream CNN/MLP processing of seasonal and trend components, achieving strong accuracy and better transfer generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers for time series often handle limited time horizons and fixed scales; traditional decomposition methods like STL require pre-specified seasonal periods and struggle with multiple seasonality. There is a need for a model that handles diverse scales and complex seasonality without manual tuning.

Method: 1) Hybrid decomposition: EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN, noise Top-k gating to balance seasonal and trend components. 2) Multi-scale adaptive pathway: sparse allocator routes features to four parallel Transformer layers; sparse combiner merges features; hybrid attention combines local CNNs and global interactions. 3) Dual-stream residual learning: CNN and MLP branches process seasonal and trend components separately, coordinated by a balanced loss minimizing expert collaboration variance.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on select datasets, with stronger generalization across various transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: DSAT-HD effectively integrates hybrid decomposition, multi-scale adaptation, and dual-stream residual learning to capture diverse time-series features across scales, delivering improved accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed regularization can yield i.i.d.-like learning rates for dependent data when priors are aligned, eliminating sample-size penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how incorporating physical priors in learning with dependent data affects learning rates and risk bounds.

Method: Derives complexity-dependent bounds on excess risk (in probability and expectation) for ERM with physics-informed regularization; analyzes alignment of prior information; compares Sobolev minimax vs i.i.d. rates under dependence.

Result: If the physical prior is aligned, the learning rate improves from the slow Sobolev minimax rate to the fast optimal i.i.d. rate; no sample-size deflation due to data dependence.

Conclusion: Aligned physics-informed priors enable dependence to be effectively neutralized for learning rate, highlighting the value of integrating domain knowledge in IRM with dependent data.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

*Boxuan Zhang,Runqing Wang,Wei Xiao,Weipu Zhang,Jian Sun,Gao Huang,Jie Chen,Gang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic-modulation MBRL (DyMoDreamer) uses an inter-frame differencing mask to focus on object-level motion and temporal cues, integrated as stochastic dynamics modulation in an RSSM, yielding strong sample-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample inefficiency in deep reinforcement learning remains a bottleneck; standard world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds, which is costly for visual tasks.

Method: DyMoDreamer introduces differential observations derived from an inter-frame differencing mask to encode object-level motion and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing focus on reward-relevant dynamics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on Atari 100k with 156.6% mean human-normalized score, sets a new record of 832 on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and shows a 9.5% performance improvement after 1M steps on Crafter.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that explicit dynamic feature extraction via differential observations and stochastic dynamic modulation improves world-model learning and sample efficiency, achieving strong benchmarks; code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cell2Text is a multimodal framework that converts scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions by merging single-cell foundation-model embeddings with pretrained LLMs, enabling richer, interpretable cell characterizations beyond discrete labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell models rely on discrete prediction heads that compress cellular complexity into predefined labels, limiting interpretability and contextual explanations for biologists.

Method: Fuse gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models to generate coherent, structured text describing cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity.

Result: Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, shows strong ontological consistency via PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in generated descriptions, with good generalization to unseen cells.

Conclusion: Integrating expression data with natural language outputs yields improved predictive performance and interpretable, scalable descriptions of unseen cells, enabling label-efficient characterization.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

### [614] [Beyond the Hook: Predicting Billboard Hot 100 Chart Inclusion with Machine Learning from Streaming, Audio Signals, and Perceptual Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24856)
*Christos Mountzouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Streaming popularity is the strongest predictor of Billboard Hot 100 inclusion. Among models, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost achieve around 90% accuracy, with audio features like instrumentalness, valence, duration, and speechiness providing measurable but smaller gains, and varying class-wise performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify which determinants most strongly predict a track’s inclusion in the Billboard Hot 100 in the streaming era, and compare predictive models using streaming popularity, audio features, and listening indicators.

Method: Use logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting (XGBoost) on data comprising streaming popularity metrics, measurable audio features, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. Evaluate models with accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and analyze feature contributions.

Result: Streaming popularity is the dominant predictor for Hot 100 inclusion. Instrumentalness, valence, duration, and speechiness contribute meaningfully. Logistic Regression achieves 90.0% accuracy, recall for charting 0.986 and non-charting 0.813, yielding F1 around 0.90. Random Forest reaches 90.4% accuracy, with near-perfect precision for non-charting (0.990) and high charting recall (0.992), F1 up to ~0.91. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) attains 90.3% accuracy, with non-charting recall 0.837 and charting recall 0.969, F1 similar to the other models.

Conclusion: In the streaming era, streaming popularity dominates predictive power for Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with audio-feature signals providing additional, but smaller, predictive gains. All three models yield high predictive performance (~90% accuracy), with trade-offs in precision/recall across charting vs non-charting classes.

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

### [615] [DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24868)
*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net is a dual-branch neural PDE solver combining a spectral branch for global low-frequency info with an image branch for local details, using bandwise fusion to preserve global structure while maintaining high-frequency accuracy. It improves stability and efficiency over attention-based baselines, with notable gains on Navier–Stokes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-scale, windowed self-attention PDE solvers (e.g., Poseidon/scOT) struggle to propagate global spectral coupling, causing error accumulation and drift during closed-loop rollouts. A method ensuring global coupling while preserving local details is needed for stable, accurate PDE dynamics learning.

Method: DRIFT-Net uses two branches: a spectral branch for global low-frequency information and an image branch for local, nonstationary structures. It performs lightweight low-frequency mixing, then fuses the branches at each layer using bandwise weighting (avoiding width inflation). The fused output is transformed back to the spatial domain and added to the image branch to maintain both global structure and high-frequency details across scales.

Result: On Navier–Stokes benchmarks, relative L1 error is reduced by 7%–54% compared to strong baselines; parameter count decreases by ~15%; throughput is higher than scOT. Ablations and theoretical analyses support stability and effectiveness; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net delivers improved global–local coupling, stability, and efficiency for neural PDE solvers, outperforming attention-based baselines while using fewer parameters and achieving higher throughput.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

*Teodor Chiaburu,Vipin Singh,Frank Haußer,Felix Bießmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction is used to calibrate SoilNet uncertainties in a simulated HIL annotation pipeline, yielding more efficient regression annotation and comparable classification performance under a fixed annotation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty calibration supports better human-machine collaboration and responsible ML deployment; conformal prediction provides statistically valid confidence estimates for ML models.

Method: Apply conformal prediction to SoilNet, a multimodal multitask soil-profile model; design a simulated human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline with limited expert annotations triggered by high uncertainty; compare to non-conformal baseline under the same budget.

Result: Conformalization leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks and comparable (or similar) performance scores in classification tasks under the same annotation budget; code available at repository.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction is effective for uncertainty calibration in a multimodal soil-description model, enabling targeted expert intervention and efficient use of annotation budgets, thus enhancing human-machine collaboration in this domain.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes neural scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal networks in the feature learning regime, using compressed sensing/LASSO to map how excess risk scales with data and regularization, revealing phase diagrams with regime crossovers and plateaus, and linking these to spectral properties of trained weights and power-law tails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend theoretical understanding of neural scaling laws beyond linear models, by studying quadratic/diagonal networks in the feature-learning regime and connecting scaling to weight spectra.

Method: Leverage connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO to derive a phase diagram for the scaling exponents of excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay; analyze spectral properties of trained weights to relate regimes to the weight spectrum.

Result: A detailed phase diagram showing scaling exponents across regimes, crossovers and plateau behaviors; a precise link between scaling regimes and the spectral properties of learned weights; theoretical validation of empirical observations that power-law tails in the weight spectrum correlate with generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a first-principles interpretation of neural scaling phenomena beyond linear models by tying scaling behavior to weight-spectrum structure, thereby rationalizing observed power-law tails and their relation to generalization.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

*Ya-Wei Eileen Lin,Ron Levie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive canonicalization is a framework where the canonical form of the input is chosen based on prior maximization to maximize predictive confidence, yielding continuous, symmetry-respecting models with universal approximation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Canonicalization enforces symmetry but can introduce discontinuities that harm training stability and generalization; a method is needed to preserve symmetry while maintaining continuity and universal approximation.

Method: Define adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization: select the input's standard form to maximize the network's predictive confidence. Prove continuity, symmetry-respecting properties, and universal approximation. Apply to (i) eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral GNNs and (ii) rotational symmetries in point clouds; provide algorithms for implementation.

Result: The approach yields continuous, symmetry-respecting models with universal approximation guarantees. Empirically, it outperforms data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and standard equivariant architectures on molecular/protein classification and point cloud tasks.

Conclusion: Adaptive canonicalization offers a general, theoretically grounded framework to handle symmetry in neural networks, improving stability and generalization, with broad applicability across domains involving eigenbasis and rotational symmetries.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

### [619] [Towards Understanding the Shape of Representations in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24895)
*Kosio Beshkov,Anders Malthe-Sørenssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRV and graph-filtration analysis reveal layer-dependent geometry of PLM representations. Local residue relations are captured early to mid-layers, while long-range structure encoding degrades; the strongest structural faithfulness occurs near the last layer, suggesting folding models might benefit from training on near-final layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the entire space of protein sequences is transformed by protein language models (PLMs), not just individual sequences, by embedding sequences/representations into metric spaces (SRV shape space) and analyzing structural relations via graph filtrations.

Method: Represent proteins and PLM-derived representations using square-root velocity (SRV) coordinates to form a geometric shape space; apply graph filtrations to study context-length encodings; analyze Karcher mean and effective dimension across ESM2 layers (of different sizes) on the SCOP dataset.

Result: Karcher means and effective dimensions of the SRV shape space vary non-linearly with layer depth; PLMs encode mostly local residue–residue relations and show degradation for larger context lengths; the most structurally faithful encoding occurs near the last layer, before the final layer, suggesting a folding model built on top of these layers could improve performance.

Conclusion: A geometric-interpretable view of PLMs reveals where structural features are encoded, supporting the idea of leveraging near-final layers for folding tasks and guiding future interpretability work that tracks entire spaces of sequences rather than individual instances.

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

*Sanxing Chen,Xiaoyin Chen,Yukun Huang,Roy Xie,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT and RL with tailored rewards improve exploration in LLM bandit tasks, rival classic methods, but can cause greedier exploitation; imitation of UCB can outperform teacher; emphasizes reward design and evaluation beyond average regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) shape exploration strategies in LLMs for sequential decision tasks (bandits) and how well these methods generalize across horizons and bandit families.

Method: Train LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories; apply RL with various rewards, including a regret-shaped reward to reduce variance and an algorithmic reward enabling oracle imitation; compare performance to pretrained baselines and to UCB/Thompson Sampling; test generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families; conduct behavioral analysis of exploration/exploitation.

Result: SFT/RL agents outperform pretrained models and reach regret levels comparable to UCB and Thompson Sampling; demonstrate robust generalization to longer horizons and various bandit families; behavior largely due to more aggressive, earlier exploitation, with higher risk of early catastrophic failures; agents trained to imitate UCB can outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative strategies.

Conclusion: Tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret are crucial to foster robust exploration in LLM agents; choose training paradigm based on goals; RL/SFT can approach classic bandit performance but may sacrifice exploration; imitation of strong explorers (e.g., UCB) yields strong exploitative policies; emphasize careful evaluation of exploration behavior.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

### [621] [Is Sequence Information All You Need for Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24933)
*Sebastian W. Ober,Calvin McCarter,Aniruddh Raghu,Yucen Lily Li,Alan N. Amin,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Hunter Elliott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structural information can make Bayesian optimization more data-efficient early on for stability in antibody engineering, but overall peak performance matches sequence-only methods; introducing a protein language model-based soft constraint narrows the data-efficiency gap, suggesting structure may be unnecessary for BO in antibodies under these settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antibody properties optimization is iterative and expensive. The best surrogate model for Bayesian optimization in the structured antibody space is unclear and may depend on the target property. No prior work has incorporated structural information into antibody BO.

Method: Evaluate multiple approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization and compare them to sequence-only baselines across two antibody properties (binding affinity and stability). Introduce a protein language model-based soft constraint to guide the search and assess data efficiency and peak performance.

Result: Structural cues improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, with equivalent peak performance to sequence-only approaches. When applying the language-model soft constraint, the data-efficiency gap closes for affinity and is eliminated for stability, leading sequence-only methods to match structure-based methods.

Conclusion: Structure can aid early data efficiency for some properties but does not confer a lasting advantage in peak performance. A protein-language-model soft constraint can mitigate data-efficiency gaps, suggesting that, at least for antibodies, the necessity of explicit structure in Bayesian optimization is questionable under these conditions.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

### [622] [OAT-FM: Optimal Acceleration Transport for Improved Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24936)
*Angxiao Yue,Anqi Dong,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OAT-FM reframes Flow Matching as acceleration transport per Optimal Acceleration Transport, yielding an efficient algorithm, a two-phase FM paradigm, and consistent performance gains without extensive noise data-pair generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching (FM) learns velocity fields for data generation and is commonly interpreted through Optimal Transport (OT). However, the usual straightening objective is tied to constant-velocity assumptions and lacks a direct connection to acceleration-based transport theory. The work seeks stronger theoretical grounding, improved efficiency, and practical performance in FM by leveraging OAT. 

Method: Demonstrate that the straightening objective in OT-based FM is equivalent to minimizing the action of acceleration under OAT. Propose OAT-FM, which optimizes acceleration transport in the product space of samples and velocities to enforce flow straightness. Develop a low-complexity algorithm. Propose a two-phase FM paradigm: start from a generative model trained by any FM method and fine-tune it with OAT-FM to improve velocity information while avoiding data distribution drift and the need to generate many noise-data pairs.

Result: The paper provides a theoretical connection between FM and OAT, introduces an efficient OAT-FM algorithm, and demonstrates consistent performance improvements across various generative tasks; code is released.

Conclusion: OAT-FM offers a principled acceleration-based framework for FM, enabling a practical two-phase training paradigm that enhances velocity quality and generative performance while reducing data drift and noise requirements.

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

### [623] [Learning Distinguishable Representations in Deep Q-Networks for Linear Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24947)
*Sooraj Sathish,Keshav Goyal,Raghuram Bharadwaj Diddigi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A regularized deep Q-learning method lowers positive correlations in hidden representations to improve transfer learning with linear models, achieving better transfer performance and reduced compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL transfer is costly; linear models on good representations can be data-efficient, but correlated features hinder linear transfer; reducing correlation can unlock simple transfer learners.

Method: Introduce a regularization term into a deep Q-learning objective to minimize positive correlations between feature activations in the last hidden layer; train on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar; evaluate transfer performance when using linear function approximators on new tasks.

Result: The approach improves transfer learning performance and reduces computational overhead compared to baselines; ablation studies confirm the role of decorrelation.

Conclusion: Reducing feature correlation in learned representations makes linear transfer learning more effective in deep RL and offers computation savings, suggesting a practical path for scalable transfer in RL.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

### [624] [Intra-request branch orchestration for efficient LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24957)
*Weifan Jiang,Rana Shahout,Yilun Du,Michael Mitzenmacher,Minlan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUCHESS is an LLM serving system that reduces token usage and latency for reasoning tasks by intra-request branch orchestration guided by a lightweight predictor, achieving better token-accuracy trade-offs and lower latency under various scheduling policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time reasoning (chain-of-thought, multi-branch) increases token usage and latency; prior work focuses on tokens at the expense of latency and overall efficiency. There is a need to optimize both tokens and latency in serving LLMs, especially under concurrent requests.

Method: DUCHESS uses a lightweight linear probing model over LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness. An orchestration policy decides to terminate, duplicate, or continue a reasoning branch. For multi-request workloads, it prioritizes easier tasks by estimating complexity from prompts. Implemented in vLLM serving.

Result: DUCHESS consistently improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, it reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% under First-Come-First-Served scheduling, with additional gains under difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Conclusion: Intra-request branch orchestration guided by fast, lightweight predictions can significantly cut cost and latency without sacrificing accuracy, and adding difficulty-aware scheduling further boosts performance under load.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

### [625] [Overlap-Adaptive Regularization for Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24962)
*Valentyn Melnychuk,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) to improve CATE estimation under low overlap by weighting regularization with overlap; provides debiased variants that preserve Neyman orthogonality; shows improvements across meta-learners in (semi-)synthetic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low overlap in observational data leads to biased and high-variance CATE estimates with existing meta-learners. Existing regularization is uniform and does not exploit overlap information.

Method: Propose OAR that regularizes target models proportionally to overlap weights, making regularization stronger where overlap is low. Compatible with both parametric and non-parametric second-stage models; develops debiased versions that retain Neyman-orthogonality.

Result: OAR significantly improves CATE estimation in low-overlap settings compared to constant regularization, across various meta-learners, demonstrated via (semi-)synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: OAR is flexible and, purportedly, the first approach to leverage overlap weights in meta-learner regularization, enhancing estimation accuracy and enabling robust inference with debiased variants.

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

### [626] [Double Descent as a Lens for Sample Efficiency in Autoregressive vs. Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24974)
*Ahmad Fraij,Sam Dauncey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small datasets; discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more compute to catch up, and both plateau in the overparameterized regime with no clear second descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand sample efficiency in data-scarce settings by directly comparing discrete diffusion and autoregressive models through the lens of the double descent phenomenon.

Method: Empirical comparison across model sizes and training budgets, tracking double descent curves for both models on small to moderate datasets. Examine underparameterized vs interpolation threshold and strongly overparameterized regimes, focusing on test loss behavior and the presence of any second descent.

Result: In the underparameterized regime, diffusion models need more capacity and longer training to reach interpolation; in the strongly overparameterized regime, both models behave similarly, with no pronounced second descent across a wide range of sizes. Overall, autoregressive models show greater sample efficiency on small datasets, while diffusion models only become competitive with sufficient capacity and compute.

Conclusion: For data-scarce scenarios, autoregressive models are the preferred baseline due to better sample efficiency; discrete diffusion models require ample capacity and compute to rival autoregressive performance, and neither shows a strong second descent when highly overparameterized.

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

### [627] [Random Policy Valuation is Enough for LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24981)
*Haoran He,Yuxiao Ye,Qingpeng Cai,Chen Hu,Binxing Jiao,Daxin Jiang,Ling Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROVER is a minimalist RL method for LLM math reasoning that uses Q-values from a fixed uniform policy to select actions, bypassing policy iteration, and yielding improvements in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by instability and diversity collapse in policy-optimization RL (PPO/GRPO); the math-reasoning RLVR setting maps to a finite-horizon, deterministic, tree-structured MDP with binary terminals, suggesting simpler algorithms may suffice.

Method: Compute Q-values under a uniform random policy, and select actions via a softmax over these Q-values (no generalized policy iteration). This preserves exploration diversity and scales across base models.

Result: ROVER achieves notable gains on math reasoning benchmarks, e.g., +8.2 pass@1, +16.8 pass@256, and +17.6% diversity across multiple base models.

Conclusion: A structurally tailored, minimalist RL approach can outperform more complex policy-iteration methods in LLM math reasoning, highlighting the value of leveraging problem structure to simplify training while maintaining diversity.

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

*Lu Zou,Wendi Ren,Weizhong Zhang,Liang Ding,Shuang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recasts PPO in a function-space RKHS framework with a kernel TD critic and KL-regularized natural-gradient update, yielding non-asymptotic guarantees across RKHS regimes and improved stability/efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a rigorous theoretical footing for PPO beyond finite-dimensional settings, unify various function-approximation regimes under RKHS, and derive practical proximal-update rules with optimal stochastic convergence.

Method: Decouple policy evaluation and improvement in RKHS. Use a kernelized TD critic updated with one-step transitions; perform a KL-regularized natural-gradient policy step that exponentiates the Q-values to mimic PPO/TRPO-like proximal updates. Prove non-asymptotic, instance-adaptive guarantees depending on RKHS entropy; derive a sampling rule achieving k^{-1/2} rate.

Result: Non-asymptotic guarantees that span tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and NTK RKHSs; reduced to optimal k^{-1/2} convergence for stochastic optimization; empirically, theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on control tasks, and kernel-TD critic yields favorable throughput versus GAE.

Conclusion: PPO can be grounded in RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics, providing global policy improvement and practical efficiency; clarifies when function-space PPO yields benefits and how to design proximal updates in continuous spaces.

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

### [629] [Score-based Membership Inference on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25003)
*Mingxing Rao,Bowen Qu,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Score-based MIAs on diffusion models are theoretically grounded: denoiser outputs reveal proximity to training data via a kernel-weighted local mean; a single-query attack (SimA) rivals multi-query methods; latent diffusion models are comparatively more private due to latent bottlenecks, with beta-VAE regularization impacting robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks in diffusion and latent diffusion models (LDMs) from membership inference attacks; to understand what information about membership is leaked by score estimates and how to design efficient attacks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of score-based MIAs focusing on predicted denoiser outputs; empirical evaluation across DDPM and LDM variants; development of SimA, a single-query attack; examination of latent VAE bottlenecks by varying beta regularization and discussing implications for training robustness.

Result: Denoiser outputs approximate a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples; the norm of the denoiser output encodes proximity to the training set and thus membership likelihood. SimA achieves strong, consistent performance across DDPM and LDM variants, offering a principled single-query alternative to multi-query MIAs. LDMs show surprisingly better resistance to MIAs than pixel-space models due to latent bottlenecks; adjusting beta in latent VAEs can influence vulnerability and training robustness.

Conclusion: Score-based MIAs are theoretically sound for diffusion models, and transformation to latent spaces via LDMs offers some privacy resilience, though not immunity. Effective defense requires deeper understanding of inversion in VAEs and not just diffusion inversion, and SimA provides a useful tool for evaluating privacy risk and guiding mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

### [630] [Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Wildfire Danger Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25017)
*Spyros Kondylatos,Gustau Camps-Valls,Ioannis Papoutsis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for wildfire danger forecasting that jointly models epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to improve next-day accuracy and calibration, extendable to a 10-day horizon. Demonstrates improved F1 and lower calibration error, provides uncertainty-aware wildfire danger maps and decision-support utilities (uncertainty thresholds, rejection of low-confidence predictions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire forecasting requires reliable predictions, but deep learning models often lack uncertainty quantification, risking untrustworthy decisions. Quantifying both model and data uncertainty can improve forecast reliability and support risk-aware decision-making.

Method: Develop an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for short-term (next-day) wildfire danger forecasting, with extension to up to ten days. Evaluate using accuracy (F1), calibration (Expected Calibration Error), and reliability of uncertainty estimates; generate danger maps with uncertainty layers and allow rejection thresholds for low-confidence predictions.

Result: The approach yields a 2.3% improvement in F1 score and a 2.1% reduction in Expected Calibration Error for next-day forecasts. It produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and uncertainty-aware danger maps, enabling decision-support actions such as low-confidence prediction rejection. Across horizons up to ten days, aleatoric uncertainty grows with time while epistemic uncertainty remains stable; joint modeling provides complementary insights, especially under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty enhances both the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger forecasting, supporting trustworthy, decision-ready deep learning wildfire systems.

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

### [631] [MARCOS: Deep Thinking by Markov Chain of Continuous Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25020)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Anya Sims,Enhong Chen,Yee Whye Teh,Ning Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCOS replaces token-based chain-of-thought with a latent continuous hidden Markov model of thoughts, achieving faster inference while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought token generation is slow, computationally expensive, constrains reasoning to discrete token space (information bottleneck), and entangles reasoning with spoken tokens. There is a need for a framework where reasoning unfolds in a latent, continuous space.

Method: Model reasoning as a hidden Markov chain of continuous latent 'thoughts'. Explicit reasoning steps (potentially hundreds of tokens) act as observable variables; latent process is learned via a two-phase variational training scheme since it is incompatible with standard supervised learning. Inference yields faster, step-level control over randomness and allows better separation of thought and output.

Result: On three benchmarks, MARCOS outperforms existing continuous reasoning methods and achieves performance comparable to token-based CoT; it surpasses token-based CoT on GSM8K by 4.7%, with up to 15.7x speedup in inference. Provides step-level randomness control and potential for reinforcement learning and improved reasoning.

Conclusion: MARCOS demonstrates that latent continuous reasoning can rival or exceed token-based CoT performance while offering substantial speedups and new control modalities, enabling RL-oriented and more robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

### [632] [Bayesian Surrogates for Risk-Aware Pre-Assessment of Aging Bridge Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25031)
*Sophia V. Kuhn,Rafael Bischof,Marius Weber,Antoine Binggeli,Michael A. Kraus,Walter Kaufmann,Fernando Pérez-Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian neural network surrogates rapidly assess aging bridge portfolios with calibrated uncertainty, enabling fast, uncertainty-aware triage that reduces costly analyses and interventions while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aging infrastructure portfolios require scalable, low-cost pre-assessment methods. Traditional conservative analyses are cheap but may be inaccurate; high-fidelity simulations are accurate but do not scale portfolio-wide. A scalable, uncertainty-aware surrogate can balance accuracy and cost.

Method: Train Bayesian neural networks on a large dataset of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric pipeline, based on the Swiss Federal Railway bridge portfolio, to predict code compliance factors with calibrated epistemic uncertainty.

Result: The BNN surrogates provide accurate, efficient estimates of high-fidelity results and quantify epistemic uncertainty, enabling fast triage that flags likely critical structures and guides refined analyses; a real-world case study of a railway underpass demonstrates potential cost and emission reductions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and interventions across portfolios.

Conclusion: The framework enables fast, uncertainty-aware portfolio-wide triage for aging bridge infrastructure, offering significant potential to reduce costs and emissions while maintaining decision quality.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

### [633] [A multiscale analysis of mean-field transformers in the moderate interaction regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25040)
*Giuseppe Bruno,Federico Pasqualotto,Andrea Agazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mean-field dynamics of tokens in encoder-only transformers exhibit a three-stage multiscale evolution (fast collapse to a low-dimensional manifold, intermediate clustering, slow merging of clusters) under a regime where N is large and beta scales with N; the authors provide rigorous limiting dynamics in all phases and confirm with simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand inference-time evolution of token representations in large encoder-only transformers by treating tokens as interacting particles and deriving a scalable, rigorous description of their dynamics. The work aims to explain how representations organize and coarse-grain across depth.

Method: Model tokens as particles with mean-field interactions. Analyze the moderate interaction regime where N is large and the inverse temperature beta scales with N. Derive and characterize the limiting dynamics in three phases (fast collapse to low-dimensional space, intermediate clustering, slow cluster merging). Prove convergence to these limiting dynamics as N→∞ in the scaled regime and illustrate with simulations.

Result: A rigorous, phase-by-phase characterization of the limiting mean-field dynamics governing token evolution in encoder-only transformers under the specified scaling. The fast phase collapses the empirical measure onto a low-dimensional space, the intermediate phase forms clusters, and the slow phase merges clusters into a single one; the authors prove convergence to these limits and support claims with simulations.

Conclusion: The study provides a multiscale, rigorous framework for token dynamics in deep encoder models under mean-field scaling, offering a theoretical explanation for hierarchical organization of representations during inference and validating the theory with numerical experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

*Bingrui Li,Jiaxin Wen,Zhanpeng Zhou,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trajectory invariance between learning rate and weight decay reduces hyperparameter tuning to one dominant direction, enabling an efficient tuning rule and refined scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning at scale is costly and lacks principled guidance across a broad set of hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate, weight decay). The work aims to establish general principles for efficient tuning.

Method: Empirical analysis of pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm across varying learning rate and weight decay. Identifies an invariance with respect to a combined lr+decay quantity, reducing the two-dimensional hyperparameter space to a one-dimensional tuning direction and deriving a practical tuning rule; also refines existing scaling laws.

Result: Demonstrates trajectory invariance across core training signals, collapsing the hyperparameter space to a salient direction. Provides an actionable tuning rule and updates scaling laws, while challenging several existing viewpoints.

Conclusion: Proposes new principles for efficient hyperparameter tuning and stimulates future research on scaling laws and principled tuning strategies.

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

### [635] [Advantage Weighted Matching: Aligning RL with Pretraining in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25050)
*Shuchen Xue,Chongjian Ge,Shilong Zhang,Yichen Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AWM is a diffusion RL method that uses score/flow matching with advantage-weighted samples to reduce variance and speed up training; achieves up to 24x speedup vs Flow-GRPO on diffusion models, with maintained quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining and RL post-training for diffusion use different objectives (score/flow matching vs RL gains), leading to higher variance and slower convergence. A unified, low-variance objective that preserves the pretraining goal is desirable.

Method: Introduce Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM): a policy-gradient method for diffusion that reuses the score/flow matching loss (the pretraining objective) and reweights each sample by its advantage, emphasizing high-reward trajectories while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining.

Result: Theoretically, DDPO is an implicit score/flow matching with noisy targets, causing high variance and slow convergence. AWM reduces variance and accelerates convergence. Empirically, on GenEval, OCR, and PickScore benchmarks, AWM achieves up to 24x speedup over Flow-GRPO for Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX, without sacrificing generation quality. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: AWM unifies pretraining and RL for diffusion in a way that aligns with policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and improves training efficiency while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

*Bogdan Raonić,Siddhartha Mishra,Samuel Lanthaler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based joint likelihood estimator for regression OOD detection that uses input and model prediction to produce a task-aware reliability score, validated across scientific datasets with strong error correlation; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression models in critical science can fail on out-of-distribution data; there is a need for reliable, task-aware uncertainty signals for OOD detection in regression, which current methods struggle to provide.

Method: Leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate the joint likelihood of (input, model prediction) and uses this likelihood as a reliability score that reflects the regression task.

Result: Empirically, the likelihood correlates strongly with prediction error across PDE datasets, satellite imagery, and brain tumor segmentation; demonstrates potential as a verifiable trust certificate; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Represents a foundational step toward a verifiable certificate of trust for AI-based scientific predictions and provides a practical tool for assessing trustworthiness in critical applications.

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

### [637] [Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25087)
*Shane Bergsma,Bin Claire Zhang,Nolan Dey,Shaheer Muhammad,Gurpreet Gosal,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loss curves from LLM training collapse to a universal trajectory across model scales when optimization hyperparameters are tuned for the data budget, indicating compute-efficient training. This enables practical benefits at scale (early diagnostics, early stopping) and underpins the development of an efficient LLM family (Celerity).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the loss-curve collapse phenomenon to practical, jointly-scaled LLM scaling recipes and harness it to improve efficiency, reliability, and speed of large-scale model training and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Empirically study LLM scaling with width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay scaled jointly; demonstrate that loss curves collapse across scales when hyperparameters are optimally chosen for the available data budget; validate through two-scale applications (diagnostics and early stopping) and train a competitive LLM family (Celerity) using these insights.

Result: Found that loss curves collapse across model scales under data-budget–optimal hyperparameters; deviation-from-collapse serves as an early indicator of training pathologies; collapsed curves enable reliable early stopping in hyperparameter tuning; trained a competitive LLM family (Celerity) leveraging these findings.

Conclusion: Loss-curve collapse is a robust signature of compute-efficient training for LLMs under practical scaling recipes, with tangible benefits for diagnostics, hyperparameter tuning efficiency, and scalable development of efficient models.

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

*Aasheesh Singh,Vishal Vaddina,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORPO-Distill is a general cross-architecture LLM distillation method that uses an odds-ratio preference optimization over diverse reasoning traces and a mixed-policy student-output strategy, yielding consistent gains over standard black-box KD baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilling knowledge across different model architectures is challenging; standard CoT distillation may not transfer reasoning effectively. There is a need for a method that leverages diverse reasoning traces and a principled preference-based objective to better align teacher and student reasoning across architectures.

Method: Propose ORPO-Distill, which uses an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization objective to compare teacher and student traces. The approach transfers knowledge via diverse reasoning traces and employs a mixed-policy strategy to utilize student-generated outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives across architectures.

Result: Experiments on five datasets with multiple student models show consistent improvements over conventional black-box KD baselines.

Conclusion: ORPO-Distill provides a general, effective framework for cross-architecture LLM distillation by leveraging a preference-based objective and diverse reasoning traces, with a robust mixed-policy approach that yields consistent gains across datasets.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on
five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over
conventional black-box KD baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised probe-learning for X-ray ptychography enables a single physics-informed NN to generalize across multiple beamlines, reconstruct unseen experiments rapidly, and support real-time feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography data rates will increase at next-gen light sources, necessitating fast, robust reconstructions. Current DL methods struggle with robustness across diverse experimental conditions, hindering real-time feedback and widespread adoption.

Method: An unsupervised training workflow focused on probe learning by merging experimentally-measured probes with procedurally generated synthetic objects. This probe-centric strategy trains one physics-informed neural network to reconstruct from unseen experiments across multiple beamlines, achieving multi-probe generalization.

Result: Models trained with the synthetic probe workflow attain reconstruction fidelity comparable to models trained on real experimental data, and generalize to different synthetic object types, enabling real-time feedback and experiment-steering under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: Probe-learning is crucial alongside in-distribution learning for robust, generalizable reconstructions in ptychography. The approach supports real-time feedback across varied beamlines and experimental conditions.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

*Yuxian Jiang,Yafu Li,Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Yu Cheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIREN proposes selective entropy regularization to mitigate entropy collapse and premature convergence in RLVR for large reasoning models by masking exploration to meaningful actions/states, stabilizing training and improving performance on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs operate in vast action spaces with long trajectories, causing entropy explosion and premature convergence when using naive entropy regularization. There is a need for targeted exploration that preserves reasoning capability without destabilizing training.

Method: Introduce SIREN with a two-step entropy masking mechanism: a top-p mask to retain high-probability actions/states and a peak-entropy mask to cap entropy in lower-probability regions. Convert regularization into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Evaluate on five mathematical benchmarks and report improvements (e.g., +6.6 maj@k on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B).

Result: SIREN achieves higher average performance than prior entropy-based RLVR approaches, increases response diversity, maintains appropriate entropy levels, and preserves validation pass@k during training, addressing premature convergence.

Conclusion: Selective entropy regularization via SIREN effectively controls exploration to meaningful regions, stabilizing RLVR for large reasoning models and boosting performance on mathematical benchmarks while mitigating premature convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

### [641] [Learning in an Echo Chamber: Online Learning with Replay Adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25135)
*Daniil Dmitriev,Harald Eskelund Franck,Carolin Heinzler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new learning framework, Online Learning in the Replay Setting, models self-annotation where past predictions can appear as labels. It introduces ExThD(H) as the exact learnability metric, and shows a closure-based learner attains it with tight upper/lower bounds; reveals separations between proper/improper learning and that replay is harder than the classical setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-annotated data can reinforce errors and create echo chambers. There is a need for a precise, quantitative theory of learning when labels may be replayed from past rounds, and for understanding when learning remains feasible under such replay adversaries.

Method: Define an online learning model where at each round t the learner outputs h_hat_t and an adversary reveals either the true label f*(x_t) or a replayed label h_i(x_t). A mistake counts only when the true label is shown. Introduce Extended Threshold dimension ExThD(H) and derive matching upper and lower bounds. Propose a closure-based learner that achieves at most ExThD(H) mistakes. Analyze both adaptive and stochastic adversaries, discuss intersection-closed classes, and compare replay to the classical mistake-bound setting. Examine separations between proper and improper learning.

Result: ExThD(H) is the exact measure of learnability in the replay setting. A closure-based learner achieves at most ExThD(H) mistakes against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can do better. For stochastic adversaries, a similar bound holds for every intersection-closed class. Replay is strictly harder than the classical setting (even constant Littlestone dimension classes can have arbitrarily large ExThD(H)). Proper learning is characterized: a class is properly learnable under replay iff it is almost intersection-closed; otherwise, every proper learner incurs Ω(T) errors, while an improper algorithm can still reach the ExThD bound.

Conclusion: This work provides the first tight analysis of learning against replay adversaries, anchored by new closure-type algorithms. It clarifies the limits of proper learning under replay, highlights the power of closure-based strategies, and offers a precise measure (ExThD) to compare learnability under replay versus classical settings.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

TL;DR: BALF enables activation-aware factorization and a budgeted rank allocator to compress neural networks without fine-tuning, achieving substantial FLOPs reduction with minimal accuracy loss across CNNs and vision transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical, tuning-free model compression on commodity hardware by removing expensive fine-tuning/search and leveraging activation-aware factorization inspired by LLM compression.

Method: Introduce BALF, a general activation-aware factorization framework applied across various layer types plus a scalable budgeted rank allocator to target compression budgets without overhead. Demonstrated on ResNet-20 (CIFAR-10), ResNeXt-101, and vision transformers (ImageNet) in a fine-tuning-free regime.

Result: BALF reduces FLOPs by 45% on ResNeXt-101 with only a 1 percentage point drop in top-1 accuracy; effective across multiple scales/architectures with no fine-tuning required.

Conclusion: BALF provides an efficient, tuning-free compression pipeline applicable to diverse architectures, offering flexible budget control and strong performance gains, consistent with recent activation-aware, non-finetuning compression approaches.

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

### [643] [High-Dimensional Analysis of Single-Layer Attention for Sparse-Token Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25153)
*Nicholas Barnfield,Hugo Cui,Yue M. Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention mechanisms can learn to selectively attend to sparse, informative tokens. In a sparse-token classification model, a single-layer attention classifier can achieve vanishing test error even when the signal strength grows only logarithmically with sequence length L, while linear classifiers require sqrt(L). In the finite-L, high-dimensional regime, just two gradient updates align the query with the hidden signal, yielding an attentive map that boosts informative tokens. The analysis provides exact asymptotics for test error and training loss and quantifies capacity, illustrating the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how attention can learn to focus on informative, sparsely located features, and to compare the data efficiency and learnability of attention-based models with nonadaptive linear benchmarks in sparse settings.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a sparse-token classification model in two regimes: (i) long-sequence limit (L large) showing vanishing error with log L signal growth; (ii) finite-L high-dimensional regime with proportional growth of sample size and embedding dimension. The study proves that two gradient updates suffice for the query weight to align with the hidden signal, derives exact asymptotics for test error and training loss, and characterizes model capacity.

Result: Single-layer attention can achieve vanishing test error with logarithmic-in-L signal strength; linear classifiers need sqrt(L) strength. With finite L, two gradient updates yield nontrivial query alignment and adaptive token amplification. Exact asymptotics for test error and training loss are obtained, and capacity is quantified, highlighting the benefit of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive attention-based token selection can efficiently detect sparse features and outperforms nonadaptive linear models. The results explain the learnability and capacity benefits of attention in sparse settings and provide precise characterizations of performance.

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

### [644] [Chance-constrained Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Constraint-aware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25157)
*Jinhao Liang,Yixuan Sun,Anirban Samaddar,Sandeep Madireddy,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method (CCFM) uses chance-constrained optimization during sampling to enforce hard constraints, matching the effect of projecting clean samples while preserving distribution fidelity and reducing distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often violate hard constraints from physics or task specs; projection-based methods distort the learned distribution and multi-stage approaches add complexity and error. A training-free, single-stage approach could enforce feasibility without training or heavy post-processing.

Method: Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM) integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process to enforce hard constraints directly on noisy intermediate samples, achieving feasibility equivalent to repeated projection onto the clean-sample feasible set.

Result: CCFM yields higher feasibility and fidelity compared to state-of-the-art constrained generative models, across complex physical systems governed by PDEs and molecular docking problems.

Conclusion: CCFM provides a sampler that enforces hard constraints with theoretical equivalence to projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples, while maintaining high-fidelity sample generation and reducing distributional distortion.

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

*Ehimare Okoyomon,Arbel Yaniv,Christoph Goebel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematically tests three physics-informed inductive biases to improve GNN-based voltage prediction and out-of-distribution generalization on ENGAGE grid data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is essential but data-limited; generalization to unseen grid topologies is hard. Physics-informed biases may guide learning for robustness and efficiency.

Method: Using GNN-based voltage predictors, implement three strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Evaluate on ENGAGE dataset across varied LV/MV configurations; conduct controlled experiments isolating each bias; assess standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: Controlled experiments isolate effects; some biases significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization and reliability, others primarily boost predictive accuracy; overall, results provide practical guidance on which bias to apply for robust voltage prediction in diverse distribution networks.

Conclusion: Inductive biases grounded in the physics of power flow can meaningfully improve learning; practitioners should consider these biases to achieve reliable, efficient voltage prediction across grid configurations; the ENGAGE dataset enables systematic benchmarking of such strategies.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

*Peter Holderrieth,Uriel Singer,Tommi Jaakkola,Ricky T. Q. Chen,Yaron Lipman,Brian Karrer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLASS Flows enable efficient sampling for flow matching and diffusion models by using an inner flow matching model that can be retrieved from pre-trained models, bridging the gap between ODE efficiency and SDE stochasticity; it improves T2I generation and serves as a drop-in inference-time scaling solution when paired with Feynman-Kac Steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time bottlenecks in sampling: SDE-based methods are often slower and less performant than ODE-based sampling, hindering the practical scaling of flow matching and diffusion models.

Method: Introduce GLASS Flows, which simulate a 'flow matching model within a flow matching model' to sample Markov transitions. The inner model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without retraining. Combine with Feynman-Kac Steering to enhance performance, achieving efficient stochastic evolution.

Result: On large-scale text-to-image models, GLASS Flows remove the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance and serving as a simple drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow/diffusion models.

Conclusion: GLASS Flows offer a simple, scalable, drop-in approach that merges the efficiency of ODE sampling with the stochastic benefits of SDEs, enabling practical inference-time scaling for flow and diffusion models when used with Feynman-Kac Steering.

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

### [647] [TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171)
*Sophia Tang,Yuchen Zhu,Molei Tao,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TR2-D2 introduces a tree-search guided, trajectory-aware fine-tuning framework for discrete diffusion models, using Monte Carlo Tree Search to build replay buffers for reward-guided training under a stochastic optimal control objective, improving reliability of fine-tuning on discrete sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control applied to diffusion fine-tuning can steer pre-trained models toward reward-tilted distributions but tends to reinforce sub-optimal trajectories because training relies on rollouts under the current model; there is a need for more robust, trajectory-aware data to guide fine-tuning.

Method: Propose TR2-D2, which uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate replay buffers of reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories. These buffers are used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective, enabling trajectory-aware optimization.

Result:  Demonstrated on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, showing that TR2-D2 yields more reliable reward-guided fine-tuning for discrete sequence generation.

Conclusion: TR2-D2 provides a practical framework that uses MCTS-generated replay buffers to guide trajectory-aware fine-tuning of discrete diffusion models under a stochastic optimal control objective, improving reliability and effectiveness in reward-guided discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzes critic optimization landscape to improve sample efficiency; introduces XQC using BN, weight normalization, and a distributional cross-entropy loss, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current improvements in deep RL rely on larger models, exotic architectures, and more complex algorithms. This work takes a principled approach by studying the critic's optimization landscape to enhance training stability and sample efficiency.

Method: Investigates the Hessian spectrum and condition number of the critic; evaluates the impact of batch normalization, weight normalization, and distributional cross-entropy loss; proposes XQC, a sample-efficient actor-critic algorithm built on soft actor-critic principles; validates on 55 proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks.

Result: A combination of BN, weight normalization, and distributional cross-entropy yields Hessian condition numbers orders of magnitude smaller than baselines and bounds gradient norms, supporting stable learning. XQC achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency across the tested tasks with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Optimization-aware architectural and loss design can dramatically improve sample efficiency in deep RL; XQC embodies these principles, demonstrating strong empirical gains with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

### [649] [SIRI: Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25176)
*Haoming Wen,Yushi Bai,Juanzi Li,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIRI proposes a training regime that alternates between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget by varying the maximum rollout length, reducing repetitive thinking and improving efficiency without sacrificing performance, moving LRMs toward a Pareto-optimal balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often exhibit repetitive or ballistic thinking patterns; reducing such redundancy can harm performance, so a dynamic balance between exploration and concise reasoning is needed. The goal is to improve reasoning efficiency while maintaining or boosting accuracy in large reasoning models.

Method: Iteratively alternate between a compression phase (shorter rollout length) and an expansion phase (longer rollout length) during training by dynamically adjusting the maximum rollout length. Compression forces precise, valuable decisions within a limited context; expansion allows long-horizon planning. Repeated cycles progressively enhance performance and reduce output length, approaching a Pareto frontier.

Result: On DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low yields a 43.2% performance improvement on AIME24 and a 46.9% reduction in token usage after three iterations; SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy among compared methods (per Figure 1).

Conclusion: Oscillating the output truncation length during training serves as a simple, effective mechanism to balance exploration and efficiency in LRMs, guiding models toward an optimal trade-off between performance and token usage. The authors publicly release their models.

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor mobile robot localization is challenged by GPS unavailability, sensor noise, and wheel slippage. Integrating an ultrasound-based IPS with wheel odometry leverages complementary strengths to achieve more accurate positioning.

Method: Fuse ultrasound IPS measurements with wheel odometry data using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Validate the approach in a controlled indoor environment and compare against standalone IPS or odometry to assess improvements in localization and trajectory tracking.

Result: Fusion-based localization significantly enhances accuracy and precision, mitigating wheel slippage and sensor noise effects; trajectory tracking errors are reduced compared with single-sensor systems.

Conclusion: An EKF-based fusion of IPS and odometry provides robust, reliable indoor localization for mobile robots, illustrating the benefits of sensor complementary fusion in indoor environments.

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for effectively operating mobile robots in
indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile
robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system
(IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion
methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry,
compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the
robot's wheel odometry, providing a robust and reliable localization solution.
Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the
fusion-based localization system significantly enhances accuracy and precision
compared to standalone systems. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in trajectory tracking, with the EKF-based approach reducing
errors associated with wheel slippage and sensor noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust, real-time autonomous navigation for single-passenger electric vehicles by combining nonlinear model predictive control with a single-shooting solution to the OCP, enabling obstacle avoidance and adherence to non-holonomic dynamics.

Method: Apply nonlinear model predictive control using a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal control problem (OCP) as a nonlinear program (NLP) for a differential-drive, non-holonomic vehicle; utilize odometry data as localization feedback; enforce constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) and guide the vehicle to the target pose. Implemented in Gazebo and ROS.

Result: Simulation studies in both obstacle-free and static obstacle environments show the NMPC with single-shooting can drive the SEATER to the desired location while satisfying constraints, demonstrating robustness and real-time performance.

Conclusion: The NMPC with single-shooting is a viable and effective control strategy for autonomous SEATER-type vehicles in the evaluated scenarios, offering real-time, constraint-compliant navigation; potential extensions include dynamic obstacles, uncertainty handling, and hardware experiments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference time and preserve symmetry so policies generalize under rigid-body motions, enabling robust long-horizon planning in unstructured environments.

Method: Introduce rectified flows into SE(3)-equivariant diffusion pipelines to form ReSeFlow; use SE(3) equivariant networks; ensure geodesic consistency; achieve one-step inference.

Result: In simulated benchmarks, ReSeFlow with a single inference step attains better geodesic distance than 100-step baselines; up to 48.5% error reduction on painting task and 21.9% on rotating triangle.

Conclusion: Marries SE(3) equivariance with rectified flow for fast, data-efficient generative policy learning in robotics; shows potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Spatiotemporal coordination is essential for scalable multi-agent embodied navigation; MASTAVN validates the effectiveness of collaborative strategies in complex 3D environments and offers a paradigm for multi-agent embodied intelligence in time-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex
tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing
audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like
emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable
Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents
to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and
establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence
in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: LLM-driven 3D IC space planning using a post-order slicing tree yields legal, low dead-space designs with practical runtimes; generalizes to MCNC ami33/ami49; larger/irregular instances remain challenging; potential cross-domain applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address 3D IC scaling limits by reducing dead space and improving layout quality. Use data-driven LLMs to complement traditional EDA methods in space planning for 3D designs.

Method: Represent space planning with a post-order slicing tree. Fine-tune open-source LLMs on large-scale synthetic datasets. Evaluate on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks (including ami33/ami49) for legality, dead-space reduction, and runtime. Explore generalization to cross-domain placements.

Result: Achieves a favorable balance between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction. Zero-dead-space layouts achieved in a significant portion of test cases under practical runtimes. Generalizes to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger/irregular instances remain challenging.

Conclusion: LLM-based space planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional EDA methods for scalable 3D layout generation, with potential applications beyond electronics (e.g., logistics and 3D object placement).

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

TL;DR: PAMR: a persistent autoregressive framework for jointly mapping lane vectors and traffic rules across driving sequences, using Map-Rule Co-Construction and Map-Rule Cache; evaluated on MapDRv2 with improved lane annotations, achieving superior joint vector-rule mapping and persistent rule effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe autonomous driving requires accurate, persistent HD-map construction and enduring awareness of traffic rules across extended driving sequences, not just instantaneous classifications or purely geometric maps.

Method: PAMR introduces autoregressive co-construction of lane geometry and traffic rules. It processes scenes in temporal segments via Map-Rule Co-Construction and maintains rule consistency with a Map-Rule Cache across segments. Evaluation uses MapDRv2, a dataset with improved lane geometry annotations.

Result: Experimental results show PAMR achieves superior performance on joint vector-rule mapping and preserves rule effectiveness across long sequences.

Conclusion: PAMR enables persistent, integrated map-rule representations for autonomous driving, with MapDRv2 supporting robust evaluation of continuous map generation.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive

### [658] [Teleoperator-Aware and Safety-Critical Adaptive Nonlinear MPC for Shared Autonomy in Obstacle Avoidance of Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22815)
*Ruturaj Sambhus,Muneeb Ahmad,Basit Muhammad Imran,Sujith Vijayan,Dylan P. Losey,Kaveh Akbari Hamed*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A teleoperator-aware, safety-critical adaptive nonlinear MPC framework for shared autonomy in quadrupedal robots, integrating online human intent learning via a noisily rational Boltzmann model, with CBF-based safety constraints in a hierarchical control stack and real-time obstacle avoidance validated on a Unitree Go2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe and effective human–robot collaboration for teleoperated legged locomotion in cluttered environments. Fixed arbitration in existing shared-control schemes inadequately captures legged dynamics and can compromise safety.

Method: A hierarchical control stack: (i) high-level 10 Hz CBF-based adaptive NMPC (ANMPC) that blends human and robot velocity references, (ii) mid-level 60 Hz dynamics-aware NMPC enforcing reduced-order SRB dynamics to track references, (iii) low-level 500 Hz whole-body controller (via QP) imposing full-order dynamics to track mid-level trajectories. Human input is modeled with a noisily rational Boltzmann model whose parameters are online-adapted via projected gradient descent from joystick data. Safety is ensured by integrating control barrier function (CBF) constraints into NMPC to maintain forward invariance of safe sets under human uncertainty.

Result: Extensive numerical simulations and hardware experiments, including a user study on a Unitree Go2, demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

Conclusion: The framework achieves safe, real-time shared autonomy for teleoperated legged robots in cluttered environments, with online adaptation to human intent and robust safety guarantees; validated experimentally with real hardware.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

### [659] [Parameter Identification of a Differentiable Human Arm Musculoskeletal Model without Deep Muscle EMG Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22825)
*Philip Sanderink,Yingfan Zhou,Shuzhen Luo,Cheng Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable optimization approach identifies bone and superficial muscle parameters of a subject-specific arm musculoskeletal model without measuring deep muscle EMGs, by using the least-squares solution of deep-muscle forces to form a gradient for parameter identification; in simulations, it achieves comparable accuracy to methods that utilize all muscle EMGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable subject-specific musculoskeletal parameter identification for safe and reliable physically collaborative robots (e.g., exoskeletons) without relying on invasive or difficult-to-measure deep muscle EMGs, which current deep EMG reconstruction approaches struggle to make reliable.

Method: Formulate parameter identification as a differentiable optimization problem. Use the least-squares solution of deep muscle forces to compute the gradient w.r.t. model parameters, enabling identification of bone and superficial muscle parameters without reconstructing deep EMGs.

Result: Extensive simulations show that the proposed method achieves estimation accuracy comparable to a similar approach that uses all available muscle EMGs, validating its viability without deep EMG data.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate subject-specific musculoskeletal parameter identification without deep muscle EMG measurements, broadening the applicability of personalized models for safe and reliable physically collaborative robotic systems.

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

### [660] [Dynamic Buffers: Cost-Efficient Planning for Tabletop Rearrangement with Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22828)
*Arman Barghi,Hamed Hosseini,Seraj Ghasemi,Mehdi Tale Masouleh,Ahmad Kalhor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dynamic Buffer is a new planning primitive that lets robots create movable stacks as temporary buffers, enabling more efficient, feasible rearrangement in dense or large-scale clutter, reducing travel cost compared to static buffering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome inefficiencies of classical planners that rely on static buffers; dense scenes trap objects and hamper reachability; movable buffers (stacks) increase capacity and enable more flexible sequencing, inspired by human grouping.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Buffer primitive that forms temporary, movable stacks that can be transported as a unit; integrate this into an existing rearrangement planner; compare against a state-of-the-art planner; validate empirically on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper; measure manipulator travel cost.

Result: Reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density settings with a mobile manipulator; improves feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts and large-scale settings.

Conclusion: Dynamic buffering is a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust rearrangement planning, enabling movable temporary buffers that improve feasibility and efficiency, with practical validation on hardware.

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust
rearrangement planning.

### [661] [Empart: Interactive Convex Decomposition for Converting Meshes to Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22847)
*Brandon Vu,Shameek Ganguly,Pushkar Joshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Empart enables region-aware mesh simplification to optimize robotics simulations by adjusting tolerances per region, reducing convex parts and speeding up simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform simplification tolerances waste fidelity in non-critical areas while under-resolving near contact surfaces. Region-specific, interactive control aims to improve the accuracy-performance trade-off for robotics tasks.

Method: Extends convex decomposition with a parallelized framework enforcing region-based error constraints; provides an interactive UI showing approximation error and simulation impact; leverages existing convex decomposition as a subroutine; benchmarked against V-HACD.

Result: Significant reduction in the number of convex parts at a fixed error threshold compared to V-HACD; substantial simulation speedups; in a pick-and-place task, collision meshes ran 69% faster versus uniform decomposition.

Conclusion: Region-specific, interactive simplification is advantageous for robotics, enabling faster yet accurate simulations; future work could automate region selection or integrate with planning pipelines.

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

### [662] [Multi-Robot Allocation for Information Gathering in Non-Uniform Spatiotemporal Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22883)
*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Haejoon Lee,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-phase GP-based method for multi-robot spatiotemporal field estimation in non-uniform environments, learning region-specific spatial lengthscales and dynamically allocating robots based on current uncertainty, with theoretical guarantees (convergence of spatial lengthscale learning and dynamic regret bounds) and use of a 'clarity' information metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPs with global or static lengthscales misrepresent non-uniform, time-varying fields, leading to poor uncertainty estimates. The work aims to accurately capture region-specific spatial correlations and adapt to temporal changes in a multi-robot setting.

Method: Phase 1: variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2: adaptive allocation strategy reassigns robots based on current uncertainty and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. Uncertainty is encoded using the 'clarity' information metric. Theoretical results include convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation and dynamic regret bounds relative to an oracle allocation. Evaluation across diverse environments.

Result: Demonstrates improved handling of non-uniform spatiotemporal dynamics through region-specific lengthscales and adaptive sampling, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation across varied environments.

Conclusion: A practical two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation in non-uniform spatiotemporal environments, addressing kernel lengthscale heterogeneity and temporal changes, supported by convergence and regret guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

### [663] [Good Weights: Proactive, Adaptive Dead Reckoning Fusion for Continuous and Robust Visual SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22910)
*Yanwei Du,Jing-Chen Peng,Patricio A. Vela*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive integration framework Good Weights (GW) combines dead reckoning with passive visual SLAM to maintain accurate frame-level pose estimation when visual cues are unreliable, with system-wide modifications to SLAM modules and dynamic weighting that increases DR influence during poor feature tracking; demonstrated robustness in datasets and real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual SLAM performance degrades in texture-less or low-light environments where appearance cues are insufficient. Dead reckoning offers short-term accuracy but drifts over time. There is a need for a principled, adaptive integration of DR with SLAM across the full system to sustain pose estimates.

Method: Introduce the Good Weights (GW) algorithm that adaptively weights the contribution of dead reckoning within a complete SLAM system. The approach requires modifications to all SLAM modules to incorporate DR, allowing dynamic adjustment: more DR influence when visual tracking is unreliable, less when visual information is rich, to maintain continuous pose tracking.

Result: Empirical validation on collected datasets and real-world deployment shows improved pose estimation robustness and accuracy, with reduced risk of track loss and better long-term stability when visual cues are degraded.

Conclusion: GW provides a practical, robust solution for mobile navigation by integrating DR into SLAM in an adaptive, system-wide manner, enhancing performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight XR-based imitation learning framework (ARMimic) that uses only a consumer XR headset and a stationary camera to collect ego-centric demonstrations and train cross-embodiment policies, reducing demo time and improving success vs teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of conventional demonstrations (kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation) and XR-based observation methods requiring extra hardware, calibration, or constrained conditions; need scalable, safe, robot-free data collection.

Method: ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking, AR robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing; unified imitation-learning pipeline treating human and virtual-robot trajectories as interchangeable; supports long-horizon tasks and collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations.

Result: Validated on two manipulation tasks including bowl stacking; demonstration time reduced by 50% vs teleoperation; task success improved by 11% over ACT baseline trained on teleoperated data.

Conclusion: ARMimic enables safe, seamless, in-the-wild data collection and scalable robot learning across diverse environments and embodiments.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

*Trent Weiss,Amar Kulkarni,Madhur Behl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends Differential Bayesian Filtering to autonomous racing overtaking by optimizing collision-free trajectories over Composite Bezier Curves (DBF-MA); derivative-free and avoids common simplifications, achieving 87% overtaking success and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overtaking in autonomous racing on complex racetracks is challenging due to collision avoidance and dynamic constraints. Many existing methods rely on oversimplified assumptions, which can lead to unsafe or suboptimal trajectories. A robust, collision-free trajectory synthesis method is needed.

Method: A trajectory synthesis approach based on an extension of Differential Bayesian Filtering (DBF). Collision-free trajectories are formulated as Bayesian inference over the space of Composite Bezier Curves. The method is derivative-free and does not require spherical footprints, constraint linearization, or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance.

Result: Closed-loop analysis shows the DBF-MA planner successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of tested scenarios, outperforming existing autonomous overtaking methods.

Conclusion: DBF-MA provides a robust, derivative-free framework for collision-free overtaking in autonomous racing without relying on simplifying assumptions, delivering higher overtaking success rates compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive controller synchronizes robot trajectory to a human's in the presence of unknown kinematics/dynamics and time-delayed information, enforcing safety with Barrier Lyapunov constraints and proving semi-global stability via Lyapunov–Krasovskii analysis, validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safe and robust human–robot collaboration where the robot's kinematics/dynamics are not fully known and communication delays exist, requiring guaranteed safety and stable synchronization to the human trajectory.

Method: Propose an adaptive controller using Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) to bound Cartesian position for safety, an ICL-based adaptive law to handle unknown kinematics, and a gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Stability is analyzed with Barrier Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals to prove SGUUB of synchronization and parameter estimation errors.

Result: Simulation studies of a human–robot synchronization scenario with time delay demonstrate effective synchronization under safety constraints and bounded/semiglobal parameter estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed BLF-based adaptive controller with LK stability analysis achieves safe, delayed synchronization of a robot to a human trajectory under unknown kinematics/dynamics, highlighting its potential for safe HRI; future work may include experimental validation.

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with
safety constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: The proposed trio of subsystems provides a reliable and scalable automated disassembly and sorting solution for EoL phones, addressing critical labor and profitability challenges in e-waste recycling.

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges
due to their high production volumes and short lifecycles. Disassembly is among
the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily
on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is
both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for
EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a
vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream
processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the
pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system
can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process
into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.

*Soofiyan Atar,Daniel Huang,Florian Richter,Michael Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sim-trained base policy for articulated tools is augmented with a sensor-driven refinement that leverages proprioception, tactile/force feedback, and cross-attention to enable online adaptation and robust sim-to-real transfer to unseen articulated tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy learning for articulated, contact-rich mechanisms is brittle due to unmodeled joint phenomena (friction, stiction, backlash, clearances) and complex interactions. The work aims to enable dexterous in-hand manipulation with reduced hand complexity and to improve sim-to-real transfer by incorporating real sensing.

Method: Train a base policy in simulation and augment it with a hardware-driven refinement module that conditions on proprioception and target articulation states. Fuse whole-hand tactile and force feedback with the policy's action intent using cross-attention-based integration to adapt online to articulation properties, stabilize contacts, regulate internal forces, and coordinate coupled-link motion under perturbations.

Result: Validated across diverse real-world tools (scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, staplers). Showed robust sim-to-real transfer, improved disturbance resilience, and generalization to unseen articulated tools, reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich settings.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robust real-world manipulation of articulated tools by combining simulation-trained policies with sensor-driven refinement and cross-attention fusion, enabling online adaptation, stability in contact-rich dynamics, and broad generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic
manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to
articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

*Yi Wang,Zeyu Xue,Mujie Liu,Tongqin Zhang,Yan Hu,Zhou Zhao,Chenguang Yang,Zhenyu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: We present ST-OVSG, a spatio-temporal open-vocabulary scene graph with latency tags to mitigate bidirectional latency in teleoperation. It uses LVLMs for open-vocabulary 3D objects, extends to time with temporal matching, and filters subgraphs for planners. It improves robustness to latency and generalizes without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency in remote teleoperation causes gaps between perceived states and operator intent, leading to misinterpretation and incorrect actions; need a representation that handles open-vocabulary categories, temporal dynamics, and latency compensation without heavy retraining.

Method: Construct ST-OVSG using LVLM-based open-vocabulary 3D objects; extend to temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with a temporal matching cost to form a unified spatio-temporal graph; embed latency tags enabling retrospective querying of past states; apply task-oriented subgraph filtering to produce compact planner inputs; allow LVLM planners to query past scenes to resolve state mismatches.

Result: Achieves 74% node accuracy on Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph; latency-robustness experiment shows planning success rate 70.5% when using ST-OVSG.

Conclusion: ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories, improves planning robustness to transmission latency, and does not require fine-tuning, supporting safer and more reliable teleoperation in high-latency environments.

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes and releases an industrial-grade multimodal interference dataset for robotic perception and control under dynamic, interference-rich environments; features synchronous visual, torque, and joint-state data with diverse interference factors; demonstrates improved robustness; dataset publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industry 4.0 systems experience nonlinear, strongly coupled environmental interference that affects both perception and control. Current datasets struggle to capture and represent these dynamic states through multimodal fusion, hindering robust model validation and deployment.

Method: Design and collect a multimodal dataset with interference factors such as size, color, and lighting variations, using high-precision sensors to synchronously acquire visual, torque, and joint-state measurements. Data acquisition uses microsecond-level time synchronization and vibration-resistant protocols via ROS. Scenarios include geometric similarity >85% and standardized lighting gradients to ensure real-world representativeness.

Result: Experimental results indicate that models validated on or trained with the dataset show enhanced robustness and improved robotic operational stability in dynamic, interference-rich environments.

Conclusion: The dataset addresses a critical gap in multimodal perception and control under environmental interference, enabling more robust evaluation and development for Industry 4.0 robotics. The dataset is publicly available at the provided link.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental
state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental
states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot
Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

### [674] [FTACT: Force Torque aware Action Chunking Transformer for Pick-and-Reorient Bottle Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23112)
*Ryo Watanabe,Maxime Alvarez,Pablo Ferreiro,Pavel Savkin,Genki Sano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal imitation-learning policy augments the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) with force/torque sensing to improve contact-rich manipulation tasks (pick-and-reorient bottles) on Telexistence Ghost, outperforming ACT-only baselines, especially when visual cues are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retail manipulation often involves subtle contact events that are not reliably detectable with vision alone. Edge cases like upright lying beverage bottles require understanding contact transitions to achieve precise manipulation. Incorporating force/torque sensing promises a practical, scalable path to improve success rates in real-world retail robots.

Method: Extend the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing to create a multimodal imitation-learning policy. Train end-to-end over images, joint states, and forces/torques. Deploy on Telexistence Ghost (single-arm) to perform Pick-and-Reorient bottle tasks. Compare against a baseline ACT with the same observation space (ablation) and evaluate the contribution of force/torque signals, especially during press and place phases when vision is limited.

Result: Hardware experiments show higher task success with the multimodal policy than the ACT-only baseline. Ablation suggests force/torque signals provide a meaningful improvement, particularly during press and place phases where visual cues are weak.

Conclusion: Integrating light force/torque sensing with modern imitation-learning architectures enables more reliable contact-rich manipulation in retail settings, offering a scalable path to broader deployment by leveraging multimodal signals for contact understanding.

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

### [675] [EKF-Based Fusion of Wi-Fi/LiDAR/IMU for Indoor Localization and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23118)
*Zeyi Li,Zhe Tang,Kyeong Soo Kim,Sihao Li,Jeremy S. Smith*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-sensor fusion framework combining Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based SLAM, and IMU navigation via EKF yields robust indoor localization with sub-meter accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-only and LiDAR/IMU solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting alone lacks accuracy. LiDAR offers high accuracy but at higher cost and complexity. A fusion approach aims to leverage complementary strengths to achieve accurate, stable indoor localization in real-world settings.

Method: 1) Coarse localization via DNN-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting. 2) Refine with IMU-based dynamic positioning using Gmapping-based SLAM to build an occupancy grid and provide high-frequency attitude estimates. 3) EKF prediction-update to fuse sensors, suppress Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift. 4) Real-world multi-group experiments in the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University to validate performance.

Result: Mean 2D localization errors range from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m across paths. Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting alone can reach up to 1.3404 m under strong interference; LiDAR/IMU localization drifts lead to 0.6233–2.8803 m errors. The proposed multi-sensor fusion framework provides stable, sub-meter accuracy across configurations by suppressing weaknesses of individual modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-sensor fusion framework effectively mitigates modality-specific weaknesses, delivering robust indoor localization performance with sub-meter accuracy in real-world deployments, outperforming single-sensor approaches.

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

*Abdul Monaf Chowdhury,Akm Moshiur Rahman Mazumder,Rabeya Akter,Safaeid Hossain Arib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAGEA uses time-grounded natural language feedback from a vision-language model to guide RL for robotic manipulation, producing dense shaping rewards that improve learning efficiency and success on Meta-World MT10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents currently lack principled methods to learn from their own mistakes; natural language can serve as an error-reasoning feedback signal to diagnose and correct behavior; aim to ground language in time and state to improve embodied agent learning.

Method: Proposes LAGEA framework that converts episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision-language model into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. It summarizes each attempt in language, localizes decisive moments, aligns feedback with a shared visual-language state, and translates progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise rewards with an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient to modulate influence.

Result: On Meta-World MT10, LAGEA outperforms SOTA by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed goals, with faster convergence, demonstrating effectiveness of language-grounded feedback in improving exploration and policy improvement.

Conclusion: Structured, time-grounded natural language can effectively teach robots to self-reflect and improve decision-making; the approach shows promise for scalable, language-guided embodied learning; code will be released.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

*Ziyi Zhou,Qian Meng,Hadas Kress-Gazit,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion on dynamic, unforeseen terrains that blends correct-by-construction symbolic synthesis with real-time MICP-based footstep planning, using symbolic repair and delay-aware replanning to reduce computation and increase robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either rely on heuristics for foothold selection, limiting robustness, or depend on expensive trajectory optimization over long horizons. There is a need for real-time, robust, and adaptable locomotion planning that can handle unforeseen terrains while maintaining tractable computation.

Method: Combine reactive symbolic synthesis (correct-by-construction controllers) with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for per-transition footstep planning. Introduce symbolic repair to generate only necessary symbolic transitions, reducing MICP solves. During execution, perform real-time MICP replanning from actual terrain data, augmented with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination to bridge offline synthesis and online operation.

Result: Simulation and hardware experiments show the framework can identify missing locomotion skills, respond effectively in safety-critical scenarios (e.g., scattered stepping stones, rebar), and adapt to dynamic terrains while reducing reliance on costly optimization.

Conclusion: The approach offers a viable path to robust, real-time quadrupedal locomotion over unforeseen terrains by fusing symbolic synthesis with optimization, using repairs to manage infeasibility and replanning to bridge offline-online operation; it highlights potential for improved adaptability and skill discovery.

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

*Kai Yang,Tianlin Zhang,Zhengbo Wang,Zedong Chu,Xiaolong Wu,Yang Cai,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CE-Nav introduces a two-stage IL-then-RL framework that generalizes local navigation across diverse robot morphologies by decoupling universal geometry from embodiment-specific dynamics. It uses an offline embodiment-agnostic expert VelFlow (a conditional normalizing flow) trained via imitation learning on planner data to capture multi-modal action distributions, followed by a lightweight Dynamics-Aware Refiner trained online with RL to adapt to target robot dynamics. This yields state-of-the-art navigation with drastically reduced adaptation cost and success in real-world deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is hindered by the need for costly embodiment-specific data, tight planning–control coupling, and the impossibility of capturing multi-modal decisions with deterministic models. A method that separates universal geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamics can reduce data needs and improve scalability.

Method: Stage 1 Offline General Expert: train VelFlow (conditional normalizing flow) via imitation learning on a large planner-generated dataset to model the distribution of kinematically-sound actions, avoiding real robot data and resolving multi-modality. Stage 2 Online Refinement: freeze the expert and train a lightweight Dynamics-Aware Refiner with online reinforcement learning on the target robot to adapt to its dynamics and controller imperfections with minimal environmental interaction.

Result: Experimental evaluation across quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and substantially reduced adaptation cost. Real-world deployments validate the method as an efficient and scalable solution for generalizable navigation.

Conclusion: Decoupling universal geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation enables scalable, data-efficient generalization of navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies. The two-stage IL-then-RL CE-Nav framework yields strong performance and practical deployment benefits.

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

*Benjamin Wong,Aaron Weber,Mohamed M. Safwat,Santosh Devasia,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive sampling for multi-robot ergodic coverage with unknown noise; uses simulated annealing to converge from uniform to an estimated optimal distribution using estimated entropy as energy; improves entropy and is validated on real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain equal acquisition quality across regions in multi-robot sensing when noise levels are unknown and early estimates are unreliable; improve sampling distribution beyond uniform or direct-ergodic approaches.

Method: Apply simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution. Start from uniform, progressively shift toward an estimated optimal distribution by tuning the Boltzmann distribution's temperature (coldness). The energy is the estimated sampling entropy, which reflects observation quality uncertainties.

Result: Simulation results show substantial improvements in both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to uniform and direct-ergodic searches. A TurtleBot swarm demonstration validates the algorithm's physical applicability.

Conclusion: Annealing toward an estimated optimal distribution mitigates early unreliability of noise estimates and improves sampling efficiency in multi-robot ergodic coverage. The method is practically applicable to real robot teams and may generalize to other domains with uncertain observation noise.

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

### [680] [GLUE: Global-Local Unified Encoding for Imitation Learning via Key-Patch Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23220)
*Ye Chen,Zichen Zhou,Jianyu Dou,Te Cui,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A global-local encoding (GLUE) framework for imitation learning that uses text-guided key-patch tracking to fuse local task-relevant patches with global features, improving robustness to clutter and occlusion by aligning training/testing distributions and outperforming strong baselines across simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global visual representations suffer under Out-of-Distribution clutter and occlusion, diluting attention and harming policy performance. Local, task-relevant representations are more invariant and can reduce covariate shift between training and testing.

Method: GLUE selects and tracks key patches as local representations via a text-guided mechanism. It introduces a fusion framework where global patch features query local patches to distill essential information, producing fine-grained local features with low heterogeneity relative to global context. The fused global-local representation guides visual attention to task-relevant objects while preserving the global context.

Result: GLUE achieves strong performance gains over the strongest baseline: 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on real-world generalization tasks. Demonstrated across diverse tasks in both simulation and real-world settings; project website provided.

Conclusion: GLUE robustly improves imitation learning by aligning training and testing distributions in a task-informative feature space through a global-local fusion of patch representations, emphasizing local invariance for task-critical objects while maintaining global context.

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

*Aoqian Zhang,Zixuan Zhuang,Chunzheng Wang,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Fan Shi,Cheng Xiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A switched policy framework for quadrupeds enabling tunable force compliance and safety under disturbances via teacher-student RL, capture-point-based safety, and a recoverability predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quadruped controllers lack adjustable compliance and robust disturbance rejection, often failing under large perturbations and not leveraging compliant interaction with the environment. This work aims to provide tunable compliance without explicit force sensing and a safe fallback mechanism.

Method: 1) Train a force-compliant policy with adjustable compliance levels using teacher-student RL without explicit force sensing. 2) Develop a capture-point-based safe policy to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy fails. 3) Introduce a recoverability network to predict failure likelihood and switch between policies.

Result: Demonstrates that quadrupeds can achieve both force compliance and robust safety under severe external disturbances by switching between policies based on predicted recoverability.

Conclusion: A practical framework that combines adjustable compliance, safety, and automatic switching to enhance robustness of quadruped locomotion with minimal sensing requirements; ready for hardware validation and further work on scalability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

*Kohei Sendai,Maxime Alvarez,Tatsuya Matsushima,Yutaka Matsuo,Yusuke Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time, lightweight A2C2 correction head improves reactivity of VLA action chunking without retraining, outperforming RTC on dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action chunking in Vision-Language-Action models trades off reactivity for efficiency; a post-hoc, real-time correction is needed to maintain closed-loop responsiveness across inference delays and long horizons.

Method: Introduce A2C2: a per-step correction head that runs at every control step, using the latest observation, the base action from the VLA, a positional feature encoding the base action's index within the chunk, and features from the base policy to output a per-step correction. It requires no retraining and is orthogonal to asynchronous schemes like Real Time Chunking (RTC).

Result: Empirical evaluation on the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial shows consistent success-rate improvements over RTC across increasing delays and horizons: +23 percentage points on Kinetix and +7 points on LIBERO. A2C2 also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay, with minimal overhead compared to full VLA inference.

Conclusion: A2C2 provides an effective, plug-in mechanism to deploy high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control without retraining.

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces gr-libs and gr-envs, open-source frameworks to standardize and facilitate Goal Recognition (GR) research in Gym-compatible environments, enabling modular baselines, diagnostics, evaluation utilities, and curated dynamic/goal-directed environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GR research is fragmented due to inconsistent benchmarks, domains, and evaluation protocols; there is a need for standardized, reproducible platforms to enable fair cross-method comparisons.

Method: Development of two complementary packages: gr-libs, which provides modular MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation utilities; and gr-envs, which offers a curated suite of dynamic and goal-directed environments with wrappers for compatibility with standard RL toolkits; both are designed to integrate with Gym-compatible workflows and are open-source on GitHub and PyPI.

Result: A standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for GR research, comprising ready-to-use libraries and environments that facilitate fair evaluation and comparison and support reproducible experiments.

Conclusion: Together, gr-libs and gr-envs provide a standardized, extensible platform to advance GR research in online, one-shot settings, promoting reproducibility and comparability across studies.

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field
remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and
evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source
frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

*Francesco Marchiori,Rohan Sinha,Christopher Agia,Alexander Robey,George J. Pappas,Mauro Conti,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal jailbreak detector for robotics (J-DAPT) that fuses textual and visual embeddings and uses domain adaptation to generalize jailbreak detection to robotics with high accuracy and low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety vulnerabilities in LLMs/VLMs in robotic settings; existing jailbreak detectors lack generalization in domains with scarce domain-specific data, hindering safe deployment.

Method: Attention-based fusion of text and image embeddings; domain adaptation aligning general jailbreak datasets with robotics-domain reference data.

Result: Significant improvement in jailbreak detection across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation; accuracy approaching 100% with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: J-DAPT offers a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotics and demonstrates effective multimodal, domain-adaptive jailbreak detection; materials available online.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and
quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100%
with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a
practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications. Additional
materials are made available at: https://j-dapt.github.io.

*Yafes Enes Şahiner,Esat Yusuf Gündoğdu,Volkan Sezer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel deterministic sampler improves sampling in narrow passages for path planning, using occupancy grids to bias sampling and achieve faster planning with more milestones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic path planners struggle in narrow passage environments, leading to inefficiencies in planning time and convergence. A targeted sampling strategy aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduce a new sampler that deterministically identifies narrow passages via occupancy grid maps and biases sampling toward those regions; provide open-source implementation; evaluate in specific, random, and real-world scenarios.

Result: Compared to baseline samplers, the proposed method yields faster planning times and a higher number of milestones, indicating improved sampling efficiency in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The deterministic narrow-passage aware sampler enhances path-planning performance across simulated and real-world settings and is released as open-source for wider use.

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

*Jun Chen,Jiaqing Ma,Philip Dames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified motion planning framework that combines frontier exploration, Lloyd-based guaranteed coverage, and sensor-driven multi-target tracking, validated by MATLAB simulations showing improved performance over standard methods in unknown, non-convex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously exploring unknown non-convex spaces, locating and tracking targets with high-precision data collection, which current work handles only individually; demanding a joint framework for exploration, search, and tracking for applications like environmental monitoring and rescue operations.

Method: Integrate three strategies: frontier-based exploration for discovery; Lloyd's algorithm-based guaranteed coverage to ensure complete area visitation; and sensor-based multi-target tracking to maintain high-precision tracking of multiple targets. The framework balances exploration and tracking, likely in a cooperative multi-robot setting, and is validated through MATLAB simulations.

Result: Demonstrates validity and superiority over standard approaches in MATLAB simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables simultaneous optimization of exploration, search, and tracking in complex environments, improving data collection and offering a pathway toward real-world deployment and future extensions.

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUARD merges traditional control with uncertainty-aware perception using active learning and probabilistic kernels for real-time, risk-aware decision making in robotics. It fuses reactive MPC (RMPCC) with ICP to attribute uncertainty online, enabling safe collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge traditional model-based control and learning-based perception to achieve safe, efficient, and flexible robotic systems, addressing the ambiguous notion of safety in robotics.

Method: Integrates reactive model predictive contouring control (RMPCC) with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to enable online attribution of uncertainty sources using active learning and probabilistic kernel optimization, delivering real-time risk-aware decisions.

Result: Experimental studies indicate high performance of GUARD in safe collision avoidance and real-time capability, supporting broader applicability.

Conclusion: GUARD provides a practical framework to balance safety, performance, and adaptability in robotics and invites future work to extend its safety notions and applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents the framework \textbf{GUARD} (\textbf{G}uided robot
control via \textbf{U}ncertainty attribution and prob\textbf{A}bilistic kernel
optimization for \textbf{R}isk-aware \textbf{D}ecision making) that combines
traditional control with an uncertainty-aware perception technique using active
learning with real-time capability for safe robot collision avoidance. By doing
so, this manuscript addresses the central challenge in robotics of finding a
reasonable compromise between traditional methods and learning algorithms to
foster the development of safe, yet efficient and flexible applications. By
unifying a reactive model predictive countouring control (RMPCC) with an
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that enables the attribution of
uncertainty sources online using active learning with real-time capability via
a probabilistic kernel optimization technique, \emph{GUARD} inherently handles
the existing ambiguity of the term \textit{safety} that exists in robotics
literature. Experimental studies indicate the high performance of \emph{GUARD},
thereby highlighting the relevance and need to broaden its applicability in
future.

TL;DR: Space Robotics Bench is an open-source simulation framework for space robot learning that combines on-demand procedural generation with massively parallel simulations to create diverse training distributions, plus a benchmark suite and RL baselines to study generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>

Motivation: The cost and scarcity of real demonstrations/data in space robotics impede learning-based autonomy; a scalable, open-source environment is needed to generate diverse training data, enable benchmarking, and facilitate comparison across methods.

Method: A modular framework integrating procedural scene generation and large-scale parallel simulation, a library of mission-relevant benchmark tasks, and standard RL baselines; experimental case studies evaluate generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer.

Result: The framework enables vast, diverse training distributions and provides performance baselines; experiments reveal current methods' limitations but demonstrate the potential for policies that operate in real-world space tasks, highlighting the framework's utility for development and benchmarking.

Conclusion: Space Robotics Bench is a valuable resource that supports developing, benchmarking, and deploying robust autonomous space systems, addressing data scarcity and enabling meaningful cross-method comparisons and progress toward real-world operation.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems
that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial
conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered
by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited
availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics
Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It
offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation
with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast
and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground
research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive
suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios.
We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning
algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate
key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and
sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of
current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing
policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the
Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and
deploying the robust autonomous systems required for the final frontier.

*Arjun Sadananda,Ravi Banavar,Kavi Arya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Triad-inspired mitigation is integrated into the Manifold EKF to reduce magnetometer disturbances in pitch/roll estimation, with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetometer readings are highly sensitive to calibration issues and external magnetic disturbances, which degrade attitude estimates produced by the Manifold EKF.

Method: Incorporate the sub-optimal TRIAD attitude estimation feature into the Manifold EKF to mitigate the magnetometer's influence on pitch and roll, and validate the approach with experiments.

Result: Experimental validation supports the proposed TRIAD-based mitigation, showing a reduced impact of magnetometer disturbances on pitch/roll estimates within the Manifold EKF.

Conclusion: A TRIAD-inspired integration improves robustness of pitch/roll estimation in the Manifold EKF against magnetometer disturbances, as confirmed by experiments.

Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive
application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for
such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

*Haonan Chen,Jiaming Xu,Hongyu Chen,Kaiwen Hong,Binghao Huang,Chaoqi Liu,Jiayuan Mao,Yunzhu Li,Yilun Du,Katherine Driggs-Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular, diffusion-model-based policy for multimodal robotic manipulation that partitions perception into separate modality-specific models and uses a router to adaptively weight their contributions, enabling incremental addition of modalities and improved robustness over concatenation-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature concatenation across modalities is suboptimal for contact-rich, multimodal manipulation: dominant modalities like vision can drown out sparse but critical tactile signals; rigid, monolithic architectures hinder adding/removing modalities without retraining. A modular, adaptable approach is needed to improve performance and robustness in real-world settings.

Method: Factorize the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized to a single representation (e.g., vision, touch). A router network learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental integration of new representations without retraining unused parts.

Result: Evaluated on simulated RLBench tasks and real-world tasks (occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, puzzle insertion). The modular approach significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines in scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning, and shows robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. Perturbation-based importance analysis reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.

Conclusion: A modular, diffusion-based multimodal policy with a learned router offers flexible, scalable integration of modalities, improved multimodal reasoning, and robustness, with the ability to add or adapt representations without full retraining.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

*Dan BW Choe,Sundhar Vinodh Sangeetha,Steven Emanuel,Chih-Yuan Chiu,Samuel Coogan,Shreyas Kousik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized LLM-based framework for robots to request and evaluate offers of help, translating natural-language requests into STL constraints solved as MILP, achieving near-centralized performance with less information sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising deployment of heterogeneous robots (e.g., in warehousing) creates unforeseen conflicts; scalable, decentralized collaboration is needed because centralized approaches are heavy and information-demanding.

Method: A conflict-detecting robot decides, via an LLM, whether external help is needed and broadcasts an NL help request. Helper robots reason about the request with an LLM grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus–Naur Form (BNF) grammar to ensure valid NL-to-STL translations, which are solved as a MILP. The requester then selects the helper by evaluating the expected impact on system-wide makespan, considering multiple offers.

Result: Experiments show that evaluating multiple offers minimizes added makespan and outperforms simple heuristics like picking the nearest helper, achieving performance comparable to a centralized Oracle baseline without heavy information requirements.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, near-optimal decentralized coordination among heterogeneous robots for conflict resolution, reducing reliance on centralized control while delivering competitive task completion times.

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

### [692] [Zero-shot Whole-Body Manipulation with a Large-Scale Soft Robotic Torso via Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23556)
*Curtis C. Johnson,Carlo Alessi,Egidio Falotico,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fast but accurate simulation enables zero-shot sim-to-real for whole-body manipulation with soft continuum arms; achieves 88% success on 10 kg payloads with two arms and 6-DoF control, guided by a simple motion primitive rather than reward shaping, revealing reactive behaviors beyond the primitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots offer compliant interactions for manipulating large or heavy objects, but uncertainties in their kinematics/dynamics hinder simulation and control. A fast, accurate simulation can enable learning-based control and reliable sim-to-real transfer for whole-body manipulation.

Method: Develop a high-speed MuJoCo simulation (up to 350x real time on a single thread) and analyze speed–accuracy tradeoffs. Use this framework to train a learned whole-body manipulation policy for two continuum soft arms, with RL guided by a simple motion primitive. Demonstrate zero-shot transfer to Baloo hardware and compare against an open-loop baseline.

Result: Zero-shot transfer achieved an 88% success rate on Baloo. The learned policy exhibits reactive behaviors (regrasping, perturbation recovery) and does not simply mimic the primitive, though it can produce aggressive over-corrections under perturbation. This constitutes the first demonstration of forceful six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale platform (~10 kg payloads).

Conclusion: Fast, accurate simulation paired with motion-primitive-guided RL enables reliable real-world deployment of soft-robot whole-body manipulation. The policy leverages learned reactivity rather than mere imitation, and the work marks a first-of-its-kind 6-DoF manipulation with large soft-arm systems under zero-shot transfer.

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Micro-scale axial-flux PM motor with HDI PCB windings achieves high copper fill in a compact 5mm-thick, 19mm-diameter package, enabling high-torque, low-speed actuation for quasi-direct-drive (QDD) robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QDD actuation requires high torque at low speed in a very thin joint envelope; conventional wound stators struggle with copper fill and resulting resistive losses at sub-20 mm scales, limiting continuous torque.

Method: Design uses PCB windings fabricated with HDI (high-density interconnect) technology. A 48-layer stator is built by stacking four 12-layer modules. Electromagnetic and thermal analyses guide the design, followed by prototype fabrication and experimental validation of performance.

Result: Achieved a 45% copper fill in a package 5 mm thick and 19 mm in diameter, described as a record; analyses informed design and prototype performance characteristic were experimentally verified.

Conclusion: Micro-scale AFPM motors with PCB-HD I windings overcome copper-fill limitations at small diameters, enabling compact, high-torque AFPMs for QDD actuation; validated by experiments, illustrating potential for efficient, gearless drive in small robots.

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

*Seungchan Kim,Omar Alama,Dmytro Kurdydyk,John Keller,Nikhil Keetha,Wenshan Wang,Yonatan Bisk,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAVEN is a 3D memory-based aerial semantic navigation framework that uses a persistent voxel-ray map, hybrid short/long-range search, and LLM-suggested cues, governed by a behavior tree, enabling long-horizon outdoor object search with strong sim-to-real performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor open-area semantic navigation faces long horizons, unstructured environments, and sparse targets. Existing indoor/open-set methods lack long-range planning and adaptability; offline scene graphs limit online deployment. A persistent memory and adaptive behavior framework is needed for robust outdoor search.

Method: RAVEN builds a 3D semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory; employs a hybrid search that combines short-range voxel exploration with long-range ray-based exploration; leverages a large vision-language model to propose auxiliary cues; coordinates all components with a behavior tree that adaptively switches behaviors for robustness.

Result: Evaluated in 10 photorealistic outdoor simulations across 100 semantic tasks, including single-object search, multi-class/multi-instance navigation, and sequential task changes. RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and was demonstrated on an aerial robot in outdoor real-world field tests.

Conclusion: Persistent 3D memory, hybrid planning, and LLM-assisted cues enable robust long-horizon outdoor semantic navigation for aerial robots. The approach scales to large, unstructured environments and shows strong simulation gains with verified real-world applicability; future work could explore scalability, generalization to more tasks, and tighter real-world feedback loops.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ContactGrasp provides a dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset and a two-stage geometry-based expert selection (GES) framework to achieve natural, human-like grasps across diverse objects, with high training/testing success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods guided by grasp priors often yield unnatural grasp behaviors. There is a need for a dataset that encodes task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index coordination to enable natural, human-like grasping and strong generalization across object shapes and categories.

Method: Introduce the ContactGrasp dataset (773 objects in 82 categories) that explicitly encodes task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index pinching. Apply geometry-based clustering to group objects by shape and develop a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework that selects among specialized grasping experts for different object geometries, improving adaptability and generalization.

Result: The approach yields natural grasp postures and high success rates: 99.4% on the training set and 96.3% on the test set, indicating strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

Conclusion: The ContactGrasp dataset combined with the GES framework advances robust, generalizable, and human-like dexterous grasping for diverse objects, bridging data-driven learning and geometry-based specialization for real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Robust and human-like dexterous grasping of general objects is a critical
capability for advancing intelligent robotic manipulation in real-world
scenarios. However, existing reinforcement learning methods guided by grasp
priors often result in unnatural behaviors. In this work, we present
\textit{ContactGrasp}, a robotic dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset that
explicitly accounts for task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index
pinching coordination. The dataset covers 773 objects in 82 categories,
providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across
categories. Our approach demonstrates natural grasp postures and achieves high

*Jianshu Hu,Lidi Wang,Shujia Li,Yunpeng Jiang,Xiao Li,Paul Weng,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy with language-aligned VLM fine-tuning and 3D-aware representations (CLAP) improves generalization in robotic manipulation, achieving 12% higher success on GemBench with 1/5 data and 10-demo real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization gaps persist in hierarchical 3D manipulation policies even with pre-trained models; there is a need for methods that generalize to new instructions and varied environments.

Method: CLAP integrates: (1) task decomposition into coarse region and fine-grained action; (2) fine-tuning a vision-language model for 3D keypoint prediction; (3) 3D-aware representation to align language with actions.

Result: GemBench shows 12% higher average success rate than SOTA using only 1/5 training trajectories; real-world experiments show successful generalization to novel instructions and environments with only 10 demonstrations.

Conclusion: CLAP demonstrates superior generalization and sample efficiency, validating the proposed architecture for generalizing hierarchical policies in 3D manipulation.

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

### [697] [Encoding Material Safety using Control Barrier Functions for Soft Actuator Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23623)
*Nicholas Pagliocca,Behrad Koohbor,Mitja Trkov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Defines material safety for soft robots via strain-energy-based safe/unsafe sets and enforces it with a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) in a QP-based controller; validated through simulations on a pressurized hyperelastic tube.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As soft robots scale to feedback control, there is a need for a formal safety definition and provable safety guarantees, given constitutive model inaccuracies and material failure risks.

Method: Formal safety sets derived from strain energy for incompressible hyperelastic materials; enforce safety with HOCBF integrated into a quadratic-program (QP) based feedback controller; case study with a pressurized hyperelastic tube including inertia, first-order viscosity, and full-state feedback.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOCBF-based controller can enforce the material safety specification.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled, provable safety framework for soft-robot control under hyperelastic material models, using strain-energy safety sets and HOCBF-QP control; applicable to incompressible hyperelastic tubes and similar soft actuators.

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

*Peizhuo Li,Hongyi Li,Yuxuan Ma,Linnan Chang,Xinrong Yang,Ruiqi Yu,Yifeng Zhang,Yuhong Cao,Qiuguo Zhu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KiVi: a proprioception-first, visuo-spatially aware locomotion framework that separates kinesthetic and visual pathways, using memory-enhanced attention to robustly traverse diverse terrains under occlusion and visual noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based locomotion is fragile to occlusions, reflections, and lighting changes; inspired by animal sensorimotor integration to maintain stable motion using proprioception as backbone while leveraging vision for terrain-aware decisions.

Method: Separate kinesthetic and visuospatial pathways; proprioception serves as a stable backbone; selective visual input for terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance; modality-balanced fusion with memory-enhanced attention; evaluated on quadrupeds across diverse terrains and unstructured outdoor environments.

Result: Demonstrates stable traversal on diverse terrains; reliable operation in unstructured outdoor environments; robust to out-of-distribution visual noise and occlusion not seen during training.

Conclusion: Modality-balanced KiVi architecture with memory-enhanced attention improves robustness of vision-based legged locomotion and is applicable to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

### [699] [HeLoM: Hierarchical Learning for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation in Hexapod Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23651)
*Xinrong Yang,Peizhuo Li,Hongyi Li,Junkai Lu,Linnan Chang,Yuhong Cao,Yifeng Zhang,Ge Sun,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces HeLoM, a learning-based hierarchical framework for hexapod robots that enables stable, multi-limb pushing of heavy/unknown objects to target poses, with sim-to-real transfer and no fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world settings, pushing offers a simpler, non-prehensile way to manipulate objects too heavy or awkward to grasp. Exploiting multiple contact points and coordination among limbs improves stability and force distribution, inspired by multi-legged insects.

Method: A two-tier system: a high-level planner selects pushing behaviors and target object poses; a low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and generates coordinated joint actions. The robot uses redundant contacts to dynamically redistribute forces, with policies trained in simulation and deployed on real hardware without additional fine-tuning.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show stable pushing of boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to designated goal poses, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and controlled manipulation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the viability of hierarchical, multi-limb pushing for robust real-world manipulation, enabling heavy/object-pose control without fine-tuning, and suggesting avenues for generalization to other robots and tasks.

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to
designated goal poses in the real world.

*Rokas Bendikas,Daniel Dijkman,Markus Peschl,Sanjay Haresh,Pietro Mazzaglia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Oat-VLA uses object-agent-centric tokenization to drastically reduce visual tokens, enabling faster and scalable Vision-Language-Action training with maintained performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to robotic VLA tasks incurs high computational cost, largely due to visual tokenization. An efficient, object-centric representation is needed.

Method: Introduce Oat-VLA, an object-agent-centric tokenization scheme that biases the model toward scene objects and the agent’s own visuals, reducing visual tokens to only a few. Builds on object-centric representation learning.

Result: Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite and outperforms OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: Efficient, scalable VLA training is achievable through a principled tokenization strategy that emphasizes objects and agent visuals, with strong empirical gains on benchmarks and real tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

### [701] [Certifiably Optimal State Estimation and Robot Calibration Using Trace-Constrained SDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23656)
*Liangting Wu,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Trace-constrained semidefinite programs (SDPs) for robotics: enforce structure via fixed-trace PSD variables to recover rank-1 solutions, with gradient refinement and dual-certification; demonstrates PnP, hand-eye, and dual-robot calibration plus a modular virtual-robot modeling framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonconvex robotics problems are often relaxable to SDPs, but practical usefulness hinges on achieving rank-1 solutions. Trace constraints can encode essential structure and enable efficient first-order rank-1 recovery and certification.

Method: Develop fixed-trace variable representations for common robotic quantities (rotations, translations); impose trace constraints to enforce PSD matrix structure; introduce a gradient-based projection refinement to steer solutions toward rank-1 candidates; certify global optimality via the dual problem; propose a modular virtual-robot abstraction to ease modeling across problems.

Result: Demonstrate the approach on multiple robotics tasks (PnP estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot calibration) with simulations showing improved practical performance and the ability to recover rank-1 solutions; provide a framework that generalizes across problems through the virtual-robot abstraction.

Conclusion: Trace-constrained SDP with fixed-trace representations and a rank-1 refinement/projection toolkit yields practically effective, globally certifiable solutions for essential robotics problems, and the modular framework supports broad adoption across problem settings.

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

*Jun Chen,Mingjia Chen,Shinkyu Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dynamic, workload-aware MDCPP for complete 2D coverage; uses Gaussian mixture workload estimation and capacity-constrained Voronoi region assignment; distributed version handles range constraints; simulations show improvements over a sweeping baseline and reveal range impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MCPP assumes fixed robot speeds, causing imbalanced workloads and longer completion times in real-world tasks. A dynamic approach can tailor coverage effort to each robot, improving balance and efficiency.

Method: Model the remaining workload with Gaussian mixture models to capture target distribution; allocate coverage regions using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram; develop a distributed MDCPP for range-limited robotic networks.

Result: Simulation results indicate qualitative improvements and superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm; a measurable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency is demonstrated.

Conclusion: MDCPP provides a dynamic, workload-aware framework for complete coverage in 2D environments, with effective distributed implementation; performance is sensitive to communication range and outperforms fixed-velocity sweeping baselines.

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a
quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

### [703] [DA-MMP: Learning Coordinated and Accurate Throwing with Dynamics-Aware Motion Manifold Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23721)
*Chi Chu,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DA-MMP learns a dynamics-aware latent manifold of variable-length motions and uses conditional flow matching to generate dynamic throwing trajectories from few real trials, demonstrated on ring tossing with high success and good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic manipulation methods struggle to bridge the gap between planned trajectories and real execution due to control errors, contact uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects. Existing methods relying on hand-designed action parameterizations limit coordination for complex tasks and fail to generalize to new targets.

Method: Extend motion manifold primitives to variable-length trajectories using a compact parameterization. Learn a large-scale manifold from planned motions. Train a conditional flow-matching model in the latent space with a small set of real-world trials. Use this model to generate goal-conditioned throwing trajectories that compensate for execution dynamics, demonstrated on a ring-tossing task.

Result: The approach generates coordinated, smooth throwing trajectories, achieves high real-world success rates, and even surpasses trained human experts. It generalizes to novel targets outside the training range, indicating it captures the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

Conclusion: DA-MMP offers a dynamics-aware framework for goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation by learning a latent trajectory manifold and a dynamics-aware generative model, yielding robust, generalizable performance in real-world tasks like ring tossing.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance,
enabling skills such as tossing. While recent learning-based approaches have
pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

*Min Liu,Deepak Pathak,Ananye Agarwal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LocoFormer is a generalist locomotion model that can control unseen legged/wheeled robots by training with large-scale RL on procedurally generated morphologies and long-context histories, enabling adaptation to morphology and dynamics changes and robustness to disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments, limiting generalization to new robots or changed dynamics. A generalist, adaptable controller could operate across diverse morphologies without per-robot retuning, enabling scalable robotic skills.

Method: Train with massive-scale reinforcement learning on procedurally generated robots using aggressive domain randomization; employ long-context representations that span episode boundaries (non-myopic context); deploy the same model to varied robots without precise kinematic knowledge; test robustness to disturbances and failures.

Result: LocoFormer demonstrates robust control on unseen robots, adapting to morphology and dynamics at test time; withstands large disturbances like weight changes and motor failures; exhibits emergent cross-episode adaptation where early failures improve later performance.

Conclusion: A simple recipe—massive-scale RL with aggressive domain randomization and substantially extended context—can train foundation-model-like locomotion capabilities transferable across robots and potentially other robotic skills.

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reframes MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and introduces SePar, a Transformer-based planner that enables implicit communication, achieving linear rather than exponential decision complexity and outperforming prior learning-based MAPF methods with strong generalization; highlights imitation learning as important in warehouses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAPD/MAPF tasks suffer from local observation limits and expensive, non-scalable communication; there is a need for globally aware, scalable coordination that remains efficient in narrow, warehouse-like environments.

Method: Proves order-invariant optimality for path-finding policies under sequence modeling and builds SePar using Transformer architecture to enable implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining global awareness.

Result: Empirical results show SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across MAPF tasks and variants and generalizes to unseen environments; underlines the importance of incorporating imitation learning for complex maps like warehouses.

Conclusion: Sequence-modeling-based path finding is a viable and scalable approach for MAPF/MAPD; SePar provides a practical framework leveraging Transformers for global coordination with lower computational costs, and imitation learning enhances performance in challenging maps.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Conclusion: The AMFA-based multi-sensor fusion framework improves accuracy and robustness for high-precision localization in challenging environments and is suitable for climbing robot navigation; demonstrates potential for deployment in GPS-compromised scenarios.

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in
complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion
system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the
localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization
accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexFlyWheel is a self-improving data generation framework for dexterous manipulation that iteratively expands a diverse demonstration dataset via imitation learning, residual RL, and data augmentation, boosting policy performance and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scarcity and limited diversity of existing datasets for dexterous manipulation and the high cost of data collection.

Method: Start from seed demonstrations; run iterative cycles integrating Imitation Learning to extract human-like behavior, residual Reinforcement Learning to generalize, rollout trajectories in simulation, and diverse environment/data augmentation; feed back into the next cycle for a self-improving data flywheel.

Result: Generated over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across four tasks; policies achieve an average 81.9% success on challenge test sets; successful sim-to-real transfer via digital twin with 78.3% success on dual-arm lift tasks.

Conclusion: DexFlyWheel demonstrates a scalable, self-improving approach to data generation for dexterous manipulation, expanding data diversity and improving policy performance and transferability across real and digital-twin environments.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to
the real world through digital twin, achieving a 78.3\% success rate on

### [710] [MAD-PINN: A Decentralized Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Multi-Agent Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23960)
*Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MAD-PINN is a decentralized physics-informed learning framework that achieves scalable, safe multi-agent control by training on reduced-agent systems, using HJ reachability for safe neighbor selection, and applying receding-horizon execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable and provably safe control in large-scale multi-agent systems. Existing MARL, safety filters, and MPC either lack strict safety guarantees, are overly conservative, or do not scale well to many agents.

Method: An epigraph-based reformulation of the multi-agent state-constrained optimal control problem (MASC-OCP) is solved via a physics-informed neural network. Training is performed on reduced-agent systems for scalability, with decentralized deployment where each agent uses only local neighbor observations. A Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-based strategy prioritizes safety-critical interactions for neighbor selection, and a receding-horizon policy execution scheme adapts to changing interactions while reducing computation.

Result: Experiments on multi-agent navigation tasks show MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance trade-offs, scales with the number of agents, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MAD-PINN provides a scalable, safety-aware framework for large-scale multi-agent control by integrating physics-informed learning with epigraph-based reformulation, decentralized decision-making, and safety-focused neighbor selection.

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Vignesh Ramanathan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flash enables sub-millisecond Visual Place Recognition with event cameras by encoding active pixel locations into binary frames and using fast bitwise similarity, achieving large Recall@1 gains and introducing Time to Correct Match as a latency metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond dense, long-window event representations in VPR and enable real-time localization with minimal event data for autonomous navigation.

Method: Identify active pixel locations from event outputs, encode them as efficient binary frames, compare via fast bitwise operations, and normalize similarity by relative event activity between query and reference frames; operate on sub-millisecond slices of event data (<1 ms).

Result: Outperforms baselines in Recall@1 by 11.33x (QCR-Event-Dataset) and 5.92x (Brisbane-Event-VPR); introduces Time to Correct Match (TCM) to quantify lowered localization latency; claims first sub-millisecond VPR with event cameras.

Conclusion: First demonstration of sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras; the approach is fast and discriminative, with strong gains on two datasets, suggesting practical benefits for real-time autonomous localization; further work may explore generalization and robustness across scenes.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

*Ilari Vallivaara,Bingnan Duan,Yinhuan Dong,Tughrul Arslan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Linear-time diversity maintenance for particle filters by clustering particles via ancestry-tree topology; preserves multimodal estimates without heavy domain-specific metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent premature convergence and maintain diversity in particle filters operating in multimodal environments, addressing limitations of existing resampling and mixture approaches and requiring no domain-specific similarity measures.

Method: Cluster along ancestry tree; identify closely related particles within large subtrees as clusters; apply intra-cluster fitness sharing; protect particles outside clusters; evaluate in multimodal robotics simulation and real indoor environment; compare with Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.

Result: High success rates; preserves compactness; robust across domains and initial conditions; minimal negative impact on estimate compactness; demonstrates domain-agnostic applicability.

Conclusion: Tree-based diversity maintenance is effective for maintaining multimodal representations in particle filters; offers robustness and compact estimates; suitable for varied domains.

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

### [713] [BOSfM: A View Planning Framework for Optimal 3D Reconstruction of Agricultural Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24126)
*Athanasios Bacharis,Konstantinos D. Polyzos,Georgios B. Giannakis,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bayesian optimization-based view planning for 3D reconstruction in agriculture, optimizing camera placement to enable structure-from-motion with few evaluations, robust to noise, and generalizes to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently plan camera placements to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction in agricultural environments while minimizing the number of images; address noise in camera locations and images and the need to generalize to unknown similar environments without re-optimization.

Method: A reconstruction quality-based optimization framework anchored in structure-from-motion. Because the optimization objective has no analytic form and evaluations are costly, the method uses Bayesian optimization to select promising camera placements under different noise conditions, tested on simulated and real agricultural scenarios.

Result: Numerical experiments show that the approach efficiently estimates optimal camera placements, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction and good generalization to similar unseen environments.

Conclusion: A data-efficient, noise-robust VP framework based on Bayesian optimization and structure-from-motion improves 3D reconstruction in agriculture and generalizes to unseen environments without retraining.

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

### [714] [Mash, Spread, Slice! Learning to Manipulate Object States via Visual Spatial Progress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24129)
*Priyanka Mandikal,Jiaheng Hu,Shivin Dass,Sagnik Majumder,Roberto Martín-Martín,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA unifies object state-change manipulation tasks (e.g., mashing, spreading, slicing) by modeling them as spatially progressing, object-centric changes from actionable to transformed regions. It uses segmentation maps and a visual skill to produce structured observations and dense rewards, enabling RL or greedy control. Validated on real robots across 10 objects, showing faster training and higher accuracy than sparse or goal-conditioned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world manipulation tasks involve progressive object state changes that do not necessarily move the object. A unified framework is needed to represent and learn such tasks efficiently, leveraging a common structure and progress-aware perception.

Method: Introduce SPARTA: spatially progressing object change segmentation maps plus a visual skill to distinguish actionable vs transformed regions for a given state-change task. Use these to generate (a) structured policy observations that abstract appearance and (b) dense, progress-reward signals. Provide two policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation, and greedy control for fast deployment. Validate on a real robot with three tasks across 10 objects.

Result: SPARTA achieves faster training and higher accuracy compared with sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines, across three tasks and 10 objects, demonstrating the value of progress-aware visual representations for object state manipulation.

Conclusion: A unified, progress-aware representation foundation enables efficient learning and deployment for a broad family of object state change tasks, highlighting the role of actionable vs transformed region segmentation and dense progress signals.

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

### [715] [A Novel Model for 3D Motion Planning for a Generalized Dubins Vehicle with Pitch and Yaw Rate Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24143)
*Deepak Prakash Kumar,Swaroop Darbha,Satyanarayana Gupta Manyam,David Casbeer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 3D motion-planning method for fixed-wing UAVs that uses full body orientation and two control inputs, constructing shortest feasible paths by concatenating optimal Dubins-like segments on surfaces via a rotation minimizing frame, achieving fast results and shorter paths than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of 3D UAV planning that either ignore roll or rely on a single curvature-based input; enable true 3D orientation with dual-input kinematics to achieve shorter, feasible paths quickly.

Method: Represent configuration with a rotation-minimizing frame (roll, pitch, yaw). Model with two inputs: bounded pitch and yaw rates. Build paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces, enabling 3D curves that respect vehicle kinematics.

Result: Numerical simulations show the approach generates feasible paths within about 10 seconds on average and yields shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

Conclusion: The framework advances 3D fixed-wing trajectory optimization by integrating full orientation and dual-input dynamics, extending Dubins-path concepts to surfaces, with practical implications for fast, efficient UAV path planning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

*Tomoyuki Kagaya,Subramanian Lakshmi,Yuxuan Lou,Thong Jing Yuan,Jayashree Karlekar,Sugiri Pranata,Natsuki Murakami,Akira Kinose,Yang You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Memory Transfer Planning (MTP) uses a code memory of successful cross-environment control-code examples to guide LLM-based planning for robot manipulation. It selects and contextually adapts retrieved examples to the target setting, enabling planning without model updates and improving transferability from simulation to real hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for robot manipulation often struggle to transfer policies across environments due to fixed prompts or single-shot code generation, requiring manual retuning. There is a need for leveraging procedural knowledge from multiple environments to improve adaptability without retraining.

Method: MTP framework: (i) an LLM generates an initial plan and code; (ii) retrieve relevant successful control-code examples from a code memory; (iii) contextually adapt the retrieved code to the target environment and re-plan without updating model parameters. Evaluated on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, including sim-to-real transfer.

Result: MTP consistently improves success rate and adaptability over fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning across simulation and hardware scenarios. A memory constructed in simulation is effective for real hardware experiments.

Conclusion: MTP provides a practical approach to exploit procedural knowledge as in-context guidance to realize robust LLM-based planning for robotic manipulation, improving cross-environment adaptability and bridging simulation-to-real deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

### [717] [Preference-Based Long-Horizon Robotic Stacking with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24163)
*Wanming Yu,Adrian Röfer,Abhinav Valada,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs fine-tuned on a dataset of stacking preferences improve long-horizon robotic stacking planning, validated in simulation and on a real humanoid robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack domain knowledge for planning tasks that hinge on physical object properties. Long-horizon stacking with hidden objects requires reasoning about hidden physics (weight, stability, etc.). The work proposes using multimodal LLMs as high-level planners that can incorporate object properties.

Method: Use multimodal inputs for each object, and have the LLM infer the best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking preferences. Create a custom fine-tuning dataset that encodes preferences such as weight, stability, size, and footprint to align the LLM with multi-criteria planning. Compare to a pretrained LLM with prompt tuning. Evaluate via large-scale simulation and demonstrate online real-robot performance on a humanoid robot.

Result: The fine-tuned, multimodal LLM shows improved stacking completion over the prompt-tuned pretrained LLM in simulations and is demonstrated effectively on a real humanoid robot in online operation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with a dataset that captures stacking preferences enables multimodal LLMs to reason about hidden physics for long-horizon robotic stacking tasks, making them effective high-level planners for such manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A high-frequency, open-hardware torque control framework delivering up to 40 kHz whole-body linear feedback, enabling real-time interpolation of non-linear schemes (e.g., inverse dynamics, learned torque policies) to stabilize torque controllers in torque-controlled robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Torque control offers agile, robust robot motion but is often limited by instability and hardware constraints. High-frequency, open-source torque feedback could unlock more capable, reliable torque-controlled systems.

Method: Develop a whole-body linear feedback loop operating at up to 40 kHz on open-source hardware and use interpolation to incorporate non-linear control schemes (inverse dynamics, learned torque policies) during real-world execution.

Result: Stabilizing torque controllers with high-frequency linear feedback improves robustness and enables interpolation of non-linear schemes in real-time, suggesting a practical path to unleash the potential of torque-controlled robotics.

Conclusion: High-frequency linear torque feedback on open hardware is a promising route to overcome instability and hardware limits in torque-controlled robotics, enabling richer control strategies to be deployed in real-world systems.

Abstract: Torque control enables agile and robust robot motion, but deployment is often
hindered by instability and hardware limits. Here, we present a novel solution
to execute whole-body linear feedback at up to 40 kHz on open-source hardware.
We use this to interpolate non-linear schemes during real-world execution, such
as inverse dynamics and learned torque policies. Our results show that by
stabilizing torque controllers, high-frequency linear feedback could be an
effective route towards unlocking the potential of torque-controlled robotics.

### [719] [ViReSkill: Vision-Grounded Replanning with Skill Memory for LLM-Based Planning in Lifelong Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24219)
*Tomoyuki Kagaya,Subramanian Lakshmi,Anbang Ye,Thong Jing Yuan,Jayashree Karlekar,Sugiri Pranata,Natsuki Murakami,Akira Kinose,Yang You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViReSkill combines vision-grounded replanning with a reusable skill memory, enabling continual autonomous learning for robot tasks. It re-plans on failure using current scene, stores successful executions as skills, and replays them without further LLM/VLM calls, improving reliability and sim-to-real generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL/IL agents adapt slowly to new tasks, while LLMs/VLMs offer planning from minimal data but suffer from lack of geometry/physics grounding and non-deterministic outputs. There is a need to ground high-level plans in scene context and provide reliable, reusable actions.

Method: When a task fails, ViReSkill triggers a vision-grounded replanner to generate a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene. Upon success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill in a memory and later replayed, avoiding additional LLM/VLM queries. This creates a feedback loop where each attempt expands the skill set and stabilizes future executions, enabling autonomous continual learning.

Result: Evaluations on simulators (LIBERO, RLBench) and a real robot show ViReSkill consistently outperforms baselines in task success rate and demonstrates robust sim-to-real generalization across settings.

Conclusion: ViReSkill provides a practical framework for grounding, re-planning, and memory-based skill reuse that enables continual autonomous learning for robotic tasks, reducing reliance on expensive LLM/VLM calls while improving reliability.

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

*Xuan Lin,Jiming Ren,Yandong Luo,Weijun Xie,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimization-based task and motion planning framework, Logic Network Flow, integrates temporal logic into network-flow MILPs, yielding tighter convex relaxations and large speedups—enabling real-time, hardware-validated planning under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently incorporate temporal logic specifications into planning while overcoming scalability limits of Logic Tree formulations and ensuring tight relaxations for better optimization performance.

Method: Encode temporal predicates as polyhedral constraints on network-flow edges inspired by Graph-of-Convex-Sets; develop a network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination to remove continuous flow variables while preserving tightness; demonstrate on piecewise-affine dynamics with vehicle routing, multi-robot coordination, and temporal logic control, plus hardware tests.

Result: Significant computational speedups (up to orders of magnitude) across diverse benchmarks; tighter convex relaxations with fewer constraints than Logic Tree; real-time re-planning demonstrated on quadrupedal hardware under changing environments.

Conclusion: Logic Network Flow provides provably tighter relaxations and scalable, real-time planning for temporal-logic-constrained tasks, outperforming traditional Logic Tree formulations and enabling robust hardware-enabled reactivity.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

### [721] [PROFusion: Robust and Accurate Dense Reconstruction via Camera Pose Regression and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24236)
*Siyan Dong,Zijun Wang,Lulu Cai,Yi Ma,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time RGB-D dense reconstruction method that combines learning-based pose initialization with optimization-based refinement to handle unstable camera motions, achieving robustness and dense accuracy in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time dense scene reconstruction is essential for robotics, but existing RGB-D SLAM systems struggle with large viewpoint changes and fast motions; optimization methods are accurate but brittle to poor initialization, while learning-based methods are robust but less accurate for dense reconstruction.

Method: A camera pose regression network predicts metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames to initialize a randomized optimization that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms the best competitor on challenging benchmarks while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable sequences, and it runs in real-time.

Conclusion: Hybridizing learning-based initialization with optimization-based refinement yields robust real-time dense reconstruction under unstable motions without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

### [722] [SafeFlowMatcher: Safe and Fast Planning using Flow Matching with Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24243)
*Jeongyong Yang,Seunghwan Jang,Soojean Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeFlowMatcher couples flow-matching planning with control barrier functions to ensure safety in real-time path planning, using a two-phase prediction-correction integrator to generate safe, smooth paths faster than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FM-based generative planners are fast but lack formal safety guarantees and can produce incomplete paths near constraints; there is a need for certifiable safety in planning and execution.

Method: A two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) prediction phase runs the learned flow matcher once or a few steps to obtain a candidate path without intervention; (ii) correction phase refines this path with a vanishing-time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field. A barrier certificate proves forward invariance of a robust safe set and finite-time convergence. Safety is enforced only on the executed path to avoid distributional drift and local traps. Evaluations on maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks show faster, smoother, and safer paths compared with diffusion- and FM-based baselines; ablations corroborate the PC integrator and barrier certificate contributions.

Result: The approach yields faster, smoother, and safer paths than baselines, with formal safety guarantees (forward invariance and finite-time convergence) and reduced distributional drift; it scales to maze and locomotion tasks and benefits from the PC and barrier components as shown by ablations.

Conclusion: SafeFlowMatcher provides certifiably safe, efficient flow-based planning by integrating control barrier functions into flow matching with a two-phase PC integrator, addressing safety and distributional-drift issues and improving planning performance over diffusion- and FM-based methods.

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

### [723] [Contextual Neural Moving Horizon Estimation for Robust Quadrotor Control in Varying Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24281)
*Kasra Torshizi,Chak Lam Shek,Khuzema Habib,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar,Troi Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces Contextual NeuroMHE, a sequential decision-making framework using Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes to select informative environmental contexts for training a neural estimator of disturbances in quadrotor control, improving robustness and data efficiency with a 20.3% reduction in maximum absolute position error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disturbance estimation for quadrotor control is highly sensitive to environmental context. Traditional estimators require extensive, brittle tuning per scenario. ML-based tuning risks infeasible data collection across all contexts; there is a need for an approach that efficiently selects informative contexts to train a robust, generalizable estimator.

Method: A sequential decision-making strategy using Bayesian Optimization with a Gaussian Process to decide which environmental contexts to sample for data collection. The collected data tunes a neural network that adapts estimator parameters in a Contextual NeuroMHE framework, enabling dynamic adaptation without exhaustive multi-context training.

Result: Experimental results in real-world settings show a 20.3% improvement in maximum absolute position error over prior work and demonstrate that a small set of carefully chosen contexts can capture relevant environmental variations.

Conclusion: Contextual NeuroMHE improves efficiency and generalization by enabling dynamic parameter adaptation across contexts, reducing data collection burden while maintaining robust performance; the approach has potential applicability to disturbance estimation in robotics and beyond.

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

*Korbinian Moller,Roland Stroop,Mattia Piccinini,Alexander Langmann,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid RL-guided sampling framework for sampling-based motion planning in urban driving that reduces samples and computation while preserving analytical feasibility checks; integrates a world model with a decodable deep set encoder; validated in CommonRoad; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform or heuristic sampling in complex urban scenarios often yields many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. The work aims to make planning faster and more reliable by guiding sampling while keeping analytical verification.

Method: An RL agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space more likely to yield feasible trajectories, while final evaluation remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. Paired with a world model based on a decodable deep set encoder to handle varying numbers of traffic participants and reconstruct latent representations.

Result: In the CommonRoad environment, the approach achieves up to 99% fewer samples and up to 84% runtime reduction, while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates.

Conclusion: The hybrid RL-guided sampling framework enables faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments under real-world constraints; code and trained artifacts are publicly available.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained

*Yao Wang,Zhirui Sun,Wenzheng Chi,Baozhi Jia,Wenjun Xu,Jiankun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SONAR proposes an aggregated cross-modal framework forVision-Language Navigation, combining semantic-map based target prediction with a Vision-Language Model value map to improve navigation in unseen environments with varying semantic cues; evaluated in Gazebo on the MP3D benchmark, showing moderate gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular VLN methods struggle to generalize beyond training data, while Vision-Language Models generalize poorly when semantic cues are weak. A cross-modal approach seeks to balance strong generalization with scene adaptability.

Method: Introduce SONAR, a cross-modal aggregated reasoning framework. It integrates a semantic-map based target prediction module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module. Target localization uses multi-scale semantic maps combined with confidence maps to reduce false positives. The system operates in unknown environments and leverages MP3D data in Gazebo for evaluation.

Result: In experiments on Gazebo using the MP3D benchmark, SONAR achieves a success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

Conclusion: The cross-modal aggregation of semantic-map predictions and Vision-Language value maps enhances robustness to varying semantic cues and improves generalization-adaptability balance in VLN. While results are promising, performance remains task-dependent and could be further improved with refined target localization and more diverse evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaNav introduces a light Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR) that triggers reasoning only when needed via Action Entropy, enabling data-efficient Vision-Language Navigation and yielding notable gains across benchmarks with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLN demands long-horizon grounding and coherent perception-action alignment, but fixed-step or excessive reasoning wastes computation and can harm performance, especially under strict data constraints. An uncertainty-aware, adaptive reasoning approach is needed.

Method: Propose Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR) as a lightweight plugin. Use Action Entropy as a policy prior for UAR and employ a Heuristics-to-RL training regime to progressively refine the reasoning policy, enabling difficulty-aware reasoning with limited embodied-task data.

Result: With only 6K training samples, AdaNav substantially surpasses million-data closed-source models, achieving +20% SR on R2R val-unseen, +11.7% on RxR-CE, and +11.4% in real-world scenes. Code is available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Adaptive, uncertainty-driven reasoning can improve VLN performance efficiently, reducing unnecessary computation and enabling strong generalization under data scarcity; UAR serves as an effective, lightweight plugin for dynamic reasoning in embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper highlights directive counterfactuals in robot instruction-following, introducing DCFs and a DynaMIC framework to generate task flows that detect misleading directives and proactively provide feedback to humans; semantic-level experiments and ablations show improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety risks when robots strictly follow human instructions that may be misleading. The work connects counterfactual ideas from NLP to robotics, aiming to improve robustness and reliability by detecting and communicating potential misleading directives.

Method: Define directive counterfactuals (DCFs) and present DynaMIC, a framework that generates robot task flows to identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans. The approach is evaluated via semantic-level experiments and ablation studies to validate effectiveness.

Result: Semantic-level experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DynaMIC effectively identifies potential DCFs and improves the reliability of task execution by guiding feedback mechanisms.

Conclusion: Directive counterfactuals are a pertinent safety concern in robot instruction following. DynaMIC provides a proactive framework to detect and communicate misleading directives, enhancing execution reliability and suggesting avenues for future research.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

*Zhihao Wang,Jianxiong Li,Jinliang Zheng,Wencong Zhang,Dongxiu Liu,Yinan Zheng,Haoyi Niu,Junzhi Yu,Xianyuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PhysiAgent introduces an embodied scaffolding framework that orchestrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language-Action agents (VLAs) via monitor, memory, and self-reflection, plus lightweight tools, to dynamically organize components and leverage real-time proficiency feedback for better grounding and performance in real-world robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA–VLM integration relies on rigid, sequential roles (VLMs for high-level understanding and planning, VLAs for low-level execution), which hampers generalization and grounding in real-world tasks. There is a need for a dynamic, self-regulating framework that can adaptively marshal VLMs' capabilities in embodied settings.

Method: Introduce PhysiAgent, an embodied agent framework with monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes. It provides autonomous scaffolding that prompts VLMs to organize components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs, enabling coherent tool collaboration and adaptive evolution during execution.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements on complex real-world robotic tasks, showing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive framework evolution during execution.

Conclusion: PhysiAgent offers a practical, pioneering step toward grounding and integrating VLMs with VLAs in embodied agents for real-world settings, improving collaboration and task performance through adaptive coordination.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively
grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A pilot study tests a modified Public Good Game with iCub to see if robot strategies affect human cooperation; initial results show participants hesitate to contribute despite perceiving the robot as generous, highlighting challenges in robot-enabled trust within mixed groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether game-theoretic frameworks can illuminate cooperation and trust dynamics in human-robot mixed groups and to explore if robot game strategies can steer cooperative behavior.

Method: A modified Public Good Game involving three human participants collaborating with the humanoid robot iCub; robot strategies tested include always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat; pilot study conducted with nineteen participants.

Result: Preliminary analysis indicates participants prefer not to invest in the common pool even when the robot is perceived as generous, suggesting limited immediate impact of robot strategy on cooperation; results point to the potential value of robots in promoting trust and cohesion in mixed human-robot groups.

Conclusion: The study aims to glean insights on how robots can foster trust and cooperation in group contexts; while participants showed reluctance to contribute, the work points to the promise of social robots in facilitating trust and cohesion, with implications for design of robot-mediated group interactions.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to
investigate cooperation and trust in human-robot mixed groups. Particularly, we
introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An off-policy imitation learning framework AMP+SAC that combines Adversarial Motion Priors with Soft Actor-Critic to improve data efficiency and imitation quality over AMP+PPO in quadruped locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art IL often relies on PPO, which is on-policy and trades off sample efficiency and generalization. There is a need for more data-efficient, robust, and generalizable motion imitation in robotics.

Method: Proposes AMP+SAC: integrate Adversarial Motion Priors with the off-policy SAC, leveraging replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration; evaluate on quadruped gaits across multiple reference motions and terrains.

Result: AMP+SAC achieves stable task execution and higher imitation rewards than AMP+PPO, demonstrating improved data efficiency and robustness in diverse terrains.

Conclusion: Off-policy IL with AMP+SAC is a promising direction for robotic motion generation, potentially enabling more natural and adaptable behaviors; future work could explore broader tasks, transferability, and stability considerations in off-policy IL.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

TL;DR: A lightweight, interpretable framework that uses language-driven task decomposition encoded into an RNN-based DFA and a GNN controller for decentralized multi-robot coordination, validated on simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible, interpretable, and real-time coordination of robot teams via high-level natural language prompts, addressing the challenge that individual robot behavior in a group is hard to specify and must adapt to others.

Method: Represent the task as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Use an RNN to encode many automata; distill logic and sub-task decompositions from a language model into the RNN, aligning its hidden states with task semantics. Train a graph neural network (GNN) control policy conditioned on the RNN hidden states and language embeddings to produce decentralized, task-relevant actions.

Result: Evaluation on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks requiring sequential and collaborative team behavior, using a single lightweight interpretable model; link provided for additional details.

Conclusion: A NL-promptable framework that bridges language models and decentralized robotic control via DFA-RNN encoding and GNN policy, enabling scalable, interpretable multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an
RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By
training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the
hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots
to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present
evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various

collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

TL;DR: Introduces U-DiT Policy, a U-shaped diffusion transformer that fuses U-Net multi-scale features with Transformer global context to enhance diffusion-based visuomotor control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-U diffusion policies suffer from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing, restricting policy expressiveness and robustness in manipulation tasks.

Method: Propose U-DiT Policy: a U-shaped Diffusion Transformer that preserves multi-scale feature fusion of U-Net while integrating Transformers to model global context; evaluated on simulation and real-world robotic manipulation with robustness to distractors and lighting variations.

Result: In simulation, U-DiT gains ~10% over baselines and beats DP-T with AdaLN by ~6% at similar parameter budgets. In real-world tasks, it improves performance by ~22.5% over DP-U, with better generalization and robustness under distractor and lighting variations.

Conclusion: U-DiT Policy is an effective and practical foundation for diffusion-based robotic manipulation, offering improved expressiveness and robustness by combining U-Net-like multiscale fusion with Transformer-based global context.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: PoseDiff is a diffusion-based framework that converts raw RGB observations into structured robot states (e.g., 3D keypoints or joint angles) in a single step and extends to video-to-action inverse dynamics for long-horizon control using sparse keyframes and overlap-averaging, achieving state-of-the-art pose estimation on DREAM and improved inverse dynamics on Libero tasks within a unified perception–planning–control pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract targets unifying perception, planning, and control to simplify pipelines, enable real-time performance, and improve robustness in embodied AI by removing multi-stage dependencies and providing a single framework for both state estimation from vision and action generation.

Method: PoseDiff uses a conditional diffusion model to map RGB inputs to structured robot states. For video-to-action, it conditions on sparse video keyframes generated by world models and employs an overlap-averaging strategy to produce smooth, long-horizon action sequences.

Result: On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even in offline settings.

Conclusion: PoseDiff offers a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI, enabling unified handling of perception and control within a single model, with publicly available visualization on the project page.

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics
modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that

*Zhiyuan Wu,Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Xuyang Zhang,Zhongqun Zhang,Jiankang Deng,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CEDex is a cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis pipeline that aligns human grasp kinematics with arbitrary robot hands via a CVAE-generated human-like contact representation, topological alignment, and signed distance field optimization, enabling scalable, large-scale cross-embodiment grasp data (500k objects, 20M grasps across four gripper types) and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for versatile grasp data across diverse hand morphologies to enable robust manipulation, but existing methods are either physics-driven without kinematic human-like understanding or require extensive manual data collection limited to anthropomorphic shapes.

Method: 1) Use a CVAE pretrained on human contact data to generate human-like contact representations conditioned on the object. 2) Perform kinematic human contact alignment via topological merging to fuse multiple human hand parts into unified robot components. 3) Apply a signed distance field (SDF) based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints to refine grasps. 4) Build a large cross-embodiment grasp dataset by applying the above to many objects and gripper types.

Result: CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art grasp methods on cross-embodiment tasks, and the resulting dataset supports high-quality, diverse grasps that enhance cross-embodiment learning.

Conclusion: The approach bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics in a scalable, data-driven framework, enabling large-scale cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis and contributing a comprehensive dataset to train generalizable grasp models across diverse hands.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

TL;DR: Physics-informed imitation learning with a PI correction improves feasibility and stability of humanoid trajectories; validated on ergoCub, showing better physical constraint adherence and compatibility with multiple controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-learning-based humanoid control can overfit to data and violate physical laws, causing unstable trajectories and contact slipping; limited data hampers realism and safety in real-world deployment.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) incorporate physics priors through a physics-informed loss during supervised imitation learning to promote feasible trajectories; (2) apply a proportional-integral controller to the generated output state at inference to reduce drift and enforce constraints (e.g., zero foot velocity at contact). Validation on ergoCub humanoid with a physics-aware loss and PI correction; demonstrates compatibility with multiple controllers and improved constraint conformity.

Result: Improved trajectory accuracy and adherence to physical constraints, reduced contact-velocity violations, and stable real-world performance across different controllers on a real humanoid robot (ergoCub).

Conclusion: Integrating physics priors during learning and a PI-based correction at inference yields more feasible, stable, and physically consistent humanoid motions, addressing data scarcity and physics-violation issues in imitation learning.

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

*Andreea Tulbure,Rene Zurbruegg,Timm Grigat,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework (LLM-Handover) that uses LLM-driven reasoning with part segmentation to choose context-aware grasps for post-handover usability, validated on a new dataset; shows 83% zero-shot success and 86% user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current handover approaches often ignore the user’s post-handover actions, limiting real-world effectiveness and generalizability. This work targets context-aware grasp selection to improve post-handover usability, supported by a new annotated dataset and user feedback.

Method: The system takes an RGB-D image and a task description, infers relevant object parts via segmentation, and uses LLM-based reasoning to select grasps that optimize post-handover use. It introduces a dataset of 60 household objects across 12 categories with detailed part labels, and validates the approach through (i) segmentation improvement, (ii) higher grasp success and adaptability in post-handover tasks, (iii) hardware experiments achieving 83% zero-shot success, and (iv) a user study with 86% participant preference.

Result: The approach improves state-of-the-art part segmentation within the handover context, yields higher grasp success rates, and better adapts to post-handover task constraints. Hardware tests report 83% zero-shot success; users prefer the method in 86% of cases.

Conclusion: LLM-Handover demonstrates that integrating language-based reasoning with part-aware perception can produce context-aware, intuitive handovers and generalizes across post-handover scenarios, supported by a new 60-object dataset.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

*Zihao Xu,Kuankuan Sima,Junhao Deng,Zixuan Zhuang,Chunzheng Wang,Ce Hao,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An active perception framework (APREBot) combines LiDAR omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing to enable reflexive evasion in quadruped robots, yielding improvements over baselines in sim-to-real tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadrupeds navigating dynamic environments. Single-sensor systems face tradeoffs: LiDAR offers omnidirectional coverage but limited texture, while cameras provide texture but narrow field of view. Under fast reaction-time constraints, robust environmental awareness is essential for safe obstacle avoidance.

Method: APREBot integrates reflexive evasion with active hierarchical perception by fusing LiDAR-based omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing. The framework employs an active perception strategy to adapt sensing resources, expanding reliable perception for agile obstacle avoidance in quadrupeds. Validation uses sim-to-real experiments on a quadruped platform across diverse obstacles, trajectories, and approach directions.

Result: Extensive sim-to-real experiments show APREBot achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in safety metrics and operational efficiency, demonstrating more reliable environmental awareness and faster, safer evasive maneuvers.

Conclusion: APREBot demonstrates strong potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical quadruped navigation. Further work may explore real-world deployment challenges, robustness to varied conditions, and scalability of the active perception strategy. Videos are available at the project site.

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for
Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion
with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based
omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving
comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in
quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments
on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and
approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency,
highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical
scenarios. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/aprebot/

### [738] [SSR-ZSON: Zero-Shot Object Navigation via Spatial-Semantic Relations within a Hierarchical Exploration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24763)
*Xiangyi Meng,Delun Li,Zihao Mao,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSR-ZSON introduces a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot navigation framework that combines a viewpoint generation strategy with an LLM-guided global navigation cue within a TARE hierarchical exploration to improve exploration efficiency and avoid local entrapment in unknown environments; it yields substantial SR and SPL gains on Matterport3D datasets and runs in real-time on simulations and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract identifies two core limitations in zero-shot navigation: (1) inadequate semantic guidance leads to inefficient exploration, and (2) limited spatial memory due to environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. Addressing these issues requires better semantic-aware planning and global-guided exploration.

Method: SSR-ZSON integrates a viewpoint generation strategy that targets high semantic density within traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage while reducing invalid exploration, and an LLM-based global guidance mechanism to evaluate semantic associations and steer navigation toward high-value spaces. It operates within the TARE hierarchical exploration framework and is deployed in hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and on physical platforms.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements: on Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D, SR improves by 18.5% and 11.2%, and SPL improves by 0.181 and 0.140, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-time operation is demonstrated across simulations and physical setups.

Conclusion: By combining semantic-density-aware viewpoint planning with an LLM-informed global guidance strategy within a hierarchical exploration framework, SSR-ZSON effectively mitigates inefficient exploration and local entrapment in unknown environments, achieving strong zero-shot navigation performance and real-time applicability across datasets, simulators, and hardware.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

### [739] [IA-VLA: Input Augmentation for Vision-Language-Action models in settings with semantically complex tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24768)
*Eric Hannus,Miika Malin,Tran Nguyen Le,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IA-VLA uses a large vision-language model as a pre-processing step to augment the input to a vision-language-action model, improving manipulation performance on visually indistinguishable objects and complex language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action models are constrained by real-time control needs and limited language understanding from small LMs. There is a need to handle complex instructions (e.g., relative object positions) and visual duplicates without sacrificing speed.

Method: Introduce IA-VLA, a framework that leverages a large vision-language model as a pre-processing stage to generate richer context, which augments the input to a VLA. Evaluation on semantically complex tasks involving visual duplicates across three scene types, comparing a baseline VLA and two augmented variants on a dataset with code, data, and videos provided.

Result: Augmentation improves VLA performance, especially for instructions that require extrapolation from concepts seen in demonstrations, indicating the benefit of using LLM-derived context to guide action generation.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-based preprocessing with VLA improves robustness to language complexity and visual ambiguity, suggesting a promising direction for building more capable manipulation systems that can handle nuanced instructions and duplicate objects.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

### [740] [Fidelity-Aware Data Composition for Robust Robot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24797)
*Zizhao Tong,Di Chen,Sicheng Hu,Hongwei Fan,Liliang Chen,Guanghui Ren,Hao Tang,Hao Dong,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CIFT introduces fidelity-aware data composition for robust OOD generalization in robotics, using a feature-space Information Fidelity proxy and Multi-View Video Augmentation, identifying a Decoherence Point to guide training; yields >54% OOD gains on policies like pi_0 and Diffusion Policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies trained on visually homogeneous data risk shortcut learning; naive mixing of real and synthetic data can degrade learning by prioritizing visual diversity over information fidelity.

Method: Formulate data composition as an optimization using a practical Information Fidelity proxy derived from dataset feature-space geometry; employ Multi-View Video Augmentation to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum; detect a training-stability phase transition (Decoherence Point) to guide tuning; apply to policies such as pi_0 and Diffusion Policy.

Result: Significant improvement in out-of-distribution success rates, with gains exceeding 54% when using CIFT.

Conclusion: Fidelity-aware data composition is essential for robust general-purpose robots and complements data synthesis by ensuring information fidelity during augmentation.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

### [742] [Finding an Initial Probe Pose in Teleoperated Robotic Echocardiography via 2D LiDAR-Based 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24867)
*Mariadas Capsran Roshan,Edgar M Hidalgo,Mats Isaksson,Michelle Dunn,Jagannatha Charjee Pyaraka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-mounted 2D LiDAR reconstructs the chest surface in 3D to auto-estimate an initial echocardiography probe pose, achieving sub-millimeter to millimeter calibration accuracy and encouraging initial-pose accuracy in early trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate non-expert tasks in teleoperated echocardiography to reduce operator workload and exam time, addressing limitations of vision/depth methods sensitive to lighting, texture, and anatomy.

Method: Mount a 2D LiDAR on the robot to perform two linear sweeps, reconstruct the chest surface in 3D; use plane-based extrinsic calibration to relate LiDAR and robot base frames (RMS 1.8 mm, rotation <0.2 deg); align reconstructed chest surface with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose; evaluate with mannequin and human trials.

Result: Calibration RMS 1.8 mm with rotation <0.2 deg; mannequin surface error 2.78 ± 0.21 mm; human trials (N=5) initial probe points 20–30 mm from the clinical starting point; inter-trial repeatability <4 mm.

Conclusion: First demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR for 3D reconstruction of a human body surface; automated initial pose estimation is feasible and may reduce operator burden and exam time in teleoperated echocardiography, showing promising accuracy in initial tests.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in
underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed
as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JuggleRL is a reinforcement learning-based system enabling a quadrotor with a racket to juggle balls, achieving high real-world performance and robustness through large-scale simulation, calibrated dynamics, reward shaping, and domain randomization, with zero-shot transfer to hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial robots performing contact-rich interactions face uncertainty and a significant sim-to-real gap. Juggling a ball is a challenging benchmark that requires precise timing, stable control, and adaptation, motivating learning-based approaches over purely model-based controllers.

Method: Train closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation with calibrated quadrotor and ball dynamics; use reward shaping to favor racket-centered hits and sustained juggling; apply domain randomization over ball position and restitution to improve robustness; policy outputs mid-level commands for a low-level controller; deploy zero-shot on hardware with an enhanced perception module and low-latency communication; validate on real hardware.

Result: RL policy achieves an average of 311 hits over 10 consecutive trials (max 462 hits); a model-based baseline reaches at most 14 hits (avg 3.1). The policy generalizes to unseen, lighter 5 g balls, averaging 145.9 hits.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can empower aerial robots to perform robust, stable, dynamic interaction tasks like juggling, with effective sim-to-real transfer when dynamics are carefully calibrated and robustness is built in through reward design and domain randomization.

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative perception faces hard detection cases from partial detections and cumulative noise, limiting downstream accuracy. There is a need for a real-time, robust framework that can function on mobile platforms in dynamic environments.

Method: Two main components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent for cross-modal fusion using camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning and adaptive convolution to better exploit external camera features; (2) Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a lightweight diffusion-based refinement module that enhances robustness to perturbations and aligns BEV features toward a task-optimal manifold.

Conclusion: DRCP provides a real-time, robust solution for cooperative perception by fusing multi-modal information with diffusion-based refinement, enabling more reliable perception in dynamic driving environments.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles

integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)

Motivation: Robots operating in shared human environments need to understand social cues and group interactions, not just obstacle avoidance, to navigate safely and naturally.

Method: From color and depth frames of a monocular RGB-D camera, estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Apply PCA to determine dominant interaction directions. Use the shoelace formula to compute interest points and engagement areas. Implemented as a ROS 2 package for easy integration; runs at about 4 ms per frame on a single-board computer.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, real-time framework for socially aware navigation by recognizing group interactions, with open-source ROS 2 integration and source code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into

*Markus Peschl,Pietro Mazzaglia,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical imitation-learning framework uses code-generating vision-language models (VLMs) and low-level diffusion policies, with API-based subtask supervision and memory, to improve generalization and interpretability in long-horizon robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation suffers from limited generalization and data scarcity, especially for complex, long-horizon tasks, necessitating structured supervision and scalable planning–control separation.

Method: A two-level system where a code-generating VLM decomposes task descriptions into executable subtasks (subroutines) grounded by a diffusion policy that imitates robot behavior. Open-source robotic APIs provide modular, semantically meaningful labels via subtask functions. A memory mechanism preserves subtask context across time to address non-Markovian aspects like object swapping.

Result: The approach enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization over flat policies, and allows separate evaluation of high-level planning and low-level control.

Conclusion: Leveraging API-derived subtask supervision and memory-enabled hierarchical diffusion policies yields better generalization and interpretability in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, with modular, inspectable planning–execution separation.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife filmmaking faces a trade-off between capturing cinematic shots and minimizing disturbance to animals; there is a need for an interdisciplinary framework combining robotics, cinematography, and ethics.

Method: A model predictive control (MPC) based framework that dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera parameters; adaptive zoom based on acoustic and visual safe distances; path planning that avoids the animal’s field of view; emphasizes smooth, low-noise maneuvers; evaluated via simulations; code release planned upon acceptance.

Result: Simulation studies show the approach can balance cinematography quality with animal welfare; no field tests reported; code will be released after acceptance.

Conclusion: CineWild demonstrates an interdisciplinary approach bridging engineering, storytelling, and environmental ethics, offering a path toward safer, higher-quality wildlife drone cinematography.

Abstract: Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become powerful tools across
domains-from industry to the arts. In documentary filmmaking, they offer
dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told.
Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical
concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper
introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics,
cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming
from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's
field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies
interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and
environmental ethics. We validate the system through simulation studies and
will release the code upon acceptance.

Motivation: Real-time belief over target intentions and motion dynamics that can change unpredictably, without extensive prior training; need probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty for autonomous agents.

Method: Concurrent online estimation of latent intention state and adherence parameter; Bayesian filtering with a sampling-based trajectory predictor; use a Markovian latent state for intention; update in real time to handle abrupt shifts; generate probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty.

Result: Ablation studies on two cases; 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms; significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods; operates at ~270 Hz in real time without training or detailed prior knowledge.

Conclusion: An adaptive joint estimation framework yields robust, real-time, intention-aware trajectory prediction with quantified uncertainty, applicable across diverse robotic systems without extensive prior data.

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

*Junjin Xiao,Yandan Yang,Xinyuan Chang,Ronghan Chen,Feng Xiong,Mu Xu,Wei-Shi Zheng,Qing Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-based post-training for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) via a video-based world model simulator with a VLM-guided reflector, enabling data-efficient learning in non-resettable, high-risk tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-learning VLA models perform poorly with limited demonstrations; RL post-training helps data efficiency but real-world non-resettable environments hinder exploration and safety; need reliable task completion signaling.

Method: Two components: (1) a video-based world simulator that produces temporally consistent future visuals, (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous rewards and predicts action termination, enabling safe, virtual interaction instead of physical samples.

Result: The approach achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task and demonstrates improved data efficiency, safety, and execution efficiency over conventional real-world VLA methods.

Conclusion: World-Env enables safe, scalable post-training for VLA in data-scarce, high-risk settings by leveraging a virtual world model and VLM-guided signals to support exploration and reliable task termination.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

*Jan Ole von Hartz,Lukas Schweizer,Joschka Boedecker,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MSG introduces inference-time composition of multiple object-centric policies to improve sample efficiency and generalization for generative robot policies, achieving strong gains from as few as five demonstrations and enabling zero-shot transfer; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching and other generative policies are flexible but do not scale in sample efficiency. Object-centric policies help but still face limitations. A way to combine multiple policies at inference could enhance generalization and reduce data requirements.

Method: Train multiple object-centric policies (multi-stream) and compose them at inference to produce a final policy. Model-agnostic and inference-only. Analyze various composition strategies via ablations. Validate on simulation and real robot; demonstrate zero-shot transfer.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, 95% reduction in demonstrations, 89% improvement over single-stream approaches. Comprehensive ablations and deployment recommendations. Real-world transfers and zero-shot object transfer shown. Code publicly released.

Conclusion: MSG is widely applicable across generative policies and training paradigms, improving sample efficiency and generalization, and enabling zero-shot transfer; practical guidelines provided for deployment.

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

*Vijja Wichitwechkarn,Emlyn Williams,Charles Fox,Ruchi Choudhary*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A one-shot imitation learning framework that can learn long-horizon manipulation from a single demonstration without extra training or annotation, achieving 82.5% multi-step and 90% single-step success, outperforming baselines; also evaluates different pre-trained feature extractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust long-horizon robotic manipulation from minimal data by removing the need for additional training or manual annotations, addressing limitations of existing one-shot methods in multi-step tasks.

Method: A one-shot imitation learning approach that uses only a single demonstration and requires no further model training or manual annotation. The framework also compares different pre-trained feature extractors within its pipeline to assess impact on performance and efficiency.

Result: On multi-step and single-step manipulation tasks, the method achieves average success rates of 82.5% and 90%, respectively, and matches or surpasses baselines. It also provides comparative analysis of pre-trained feature extractors with respect to performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles both multi-step and single-step tasks under a single demonstration with no extra training, yielding competitive accuracy and practicality; feature extractor choice influences performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model
training or manual annotation. We propose a method that can be applied to this
setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within
our framework.

### [752] [Path Diffuser: Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Traffic Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24995)
*Da Saem Lee,Akash Karthikeyan,Yash Vardhan Pant,Sebastian Fischmeister*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Path Diffuser (PD) is a two-stage diffusion model that generates agent poses and trajectories conditioned on a map without relying on historical trajectories, using a Frenet-frame motion-primitives prior to boost diversity and road compliance; validated on Argoverse2 and OOD maps, it outperforms baselines on distribution, common-sense, and road-compliance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based traffic simulators struggle to generate novel, diverse scenarios because they rely on fully annotated logs, historical agent trajectories, and pose information. This limits scalability, realism, and generalization, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes. A method that can generate plausible agent trajectories from maps alone would enable scalable, diverse scenario generation for autonomous planning.

Method: A two-stage diffusion framework (Path Diffuser): first, generate agent pose initializations, then their trajectories, conditioned only on map data and without historical agent context. It incorporates a motion-primitives prior based on Frenet-frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compatibility. The approach also explores design choices for modeling multi-agent interactions and is evaluated on the Argoverse2 dataset, with additional tests on OOD map variants.

Result: PD outperforms baselines by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road-compliance metrics from adversarial benchmarks. It demonstrates strong effectiveness on Argoverse2 and generalizes to OOD map variants, indicating improved diversity, realism, and safety of generated scenarios without historical trajectory data.

Conclusion: Path Diffuser provides a scalable, data-efficient, and realistic simulator for autonomous planning by generating diverse, road-compliant agent trajectories from maps alone. Its diffusion-based two-stage design, aided by a Frenet-based motion-primitives prior, improves diversity and generalization to unseen maps, addressing a key limitation of prior learning-based simulators.

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AIRoA MoMa is a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation that combines synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states with a two-layer annotation schema (sub-goals and primitive actions) for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial release comprises 25,469 episodes (~94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot, standardized in LeRobot v2.1, and publicly available on HuggingFace. It aims to benchmark Vision-Language-Action models in contact-rich, long-horizon manipulation tasks in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust mobile manipulation in unstructured human environments is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich, long-horizon tasks, synchronized sensing (including force-torque), hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases, hindering progress toward generalist language-grounded agents.

Method: Data collection of real-world mobile manipulation using HSR, capturing synchronized modalities (RGB, joint states, six-axis wrist wrench, internal robot states) and providing a two-layer annotation schema: sub-goals (high-level task segments) and primitive actions (low-level movements) to enable hierarchical learning and error analysis; standardization of data format (LeRobot v2.1).

Result: A first version with 25,469 episodes (~94 hours), real-world multimodal data, and hierarchical annotations is released; dataset is standardized and publicly accessible, offering a benchmark for vision-language-action research in long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation.

Conclusion: The AIRoA MoMa dataset fills a critical gap by enabling robust evaluation and training of language-guided mobile manipulation systems in realistic settings, supporting long-horizon planning, error analysis, and hierarchical learning for next-generation vision-language-action models.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A low-cost, open-source over-the-row robot (AgriCruiser) with adjustable track width, compact turning, and a precision sprayer. Demonstrated strong weed suppression in flax plots with minimal crop damage; buildable from commodity parts for ~$5–6k; design files released to enable replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high labor costs and crop damage in row-crop weed management by providing a low-cost, modular, and adaptable robotic platform suitable for rapid deployment across diverse crops and layouts.

Method: A reconfigurable chassis with adjustable track width (1.42–1.57 m) and ground clearance (0.94 m) enabling compact pivot turns (0.71–0.79 m). Implemented a precision spraying system and evaluated weed control in twelve flax plots against manual weeding. Mobility tested on concrete, asphalt, gravel, grass, and wet/dry soils. BOM cost ~ $5–6k from commodity parts. Open-source design files released for replication and customization.

Result: In twelve flax plots, a single robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow) by 24– to 42-fold compared with manual weeding and caused less crop damage. Traversal was reliable across multiple surfaces, and the chassis supports easy integration of subsystems, phenotyping, sensing, etc., enabling replication at low cost.

Conclusion: Low-cost, reconfigurable over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop damage and labor, while serving as a versatile platform for broader agricultural sensing and phenotyping tasks. Release of design files facilitates research adoption and customization.

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and
row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57
m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact
pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland
maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other
subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to
assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single
robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)
by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also
causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,
gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal
consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from
commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of
materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and
customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable
over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop
damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for
phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design files and
implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of
modular agricultural robotics.

*Lakshan Lavan,Lanojithan Thiyagarasa,Udara Muthugala,Rajitha de Silva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-centric square spiral field layout improves autonomous farming navigation and coordination, outperforming linear layouts in key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tractor-optimized, conventional linear layouts hinder robotic navigation due to tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing.

Method: Introduce a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline. Develop a navigation stack: DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression, pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). Evaluate in simulation across 500 waypoints; extend to multi-robot coordination on the spirals rule-constrained graph with a greedy allocator.

Result: Spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and ~25% faster execution for waypoint-based tasks, across 500 waypoints; full-field coverage comparable to optimized linear U-turn strategy. In multi-robot tests, greedy allocation achieves 33-37% lower batch completion times than Hungarian assignment.

Conclusion: Redesigning field geometry to suit autonomous agriculture can substantially improve navigation efficiency, motion simplicity, and coordination among multiple robots.

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

### [756] [Curriculum Imitation Learning of Distributed Multi-Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25097)
*Jesús Roche,Eduardo Sebastián,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imitation learning for multi-robot control uses a curriculum that lengthens expert trajectories to improve long-term coordination and a perceptual proxy that converts global demonstrations into local observations, enabling scalable, robust distributed policies without onboard measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term coordination in multi-robot systems (MRS) is hard to learn and realistic training data are scarce. The work aims to improve long-horizon behavior and perception so policies can be learned from global demonstrations without expert actions or onboard sensors.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training to stabilize learning and enhance long-term accuracy; (2) a method to approximate egocentric perception from third-person global state demonstrations by filtering neighbors, transforming reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability; integrated in a physics-informed framework to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations.

Result: Experimental evaluation on two tasks with varying team sizes and noise shows that the curriculum improves long-term accuracy and the perceptual estimation method yields policies robust to realistic uncertainty, enabling learning of distributed controllers from global demonstrations even without expert actions or onboard measurements.

Conclusion: The combination of curriculum-based long-horizon training and perceptual proxying from global demonstrations enables robust, scalable MRS policies that operate in a distributed fashion without onboard measurements or expert actions.

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-free, conformal-prediction-based planner for semantic reach-avoid under perceptual uncertainty, achieving user-specified mission completion rates without assuming sensor models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic planning in unknown environments with perceptual uncertainty requires guarantees on success rates. Existing methods either ignore uncertainty or rely on known sensor models, hindering reliability and generality.

Method: Construct semantic maps on-the-fly from perceptual measurements and quantify their uncertainty using conformal prediction in a model- and distribution-free way. Use these uncertainty quantifications to synthesize a planner that guarantees user-specified mission completion probabilities without needing sensor-model knowledge.

Result: The approach provides theoretical mission completion rate guarantees and is validated by extensive experiments, where it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

Conclusion: This work delivers the first planner for semantic reach-avoid under perceptual uncertainty with user-specified success guarantees, without requiring sensor-model information, and demonstrates robust performance across tests.

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

TL;DR: Proposes Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT): an adaptive reasoning framework that unifies multiple reasoning modes within a single model and selects the appropriate mode by context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning methods optimize for specific reasoning modes and struggle to achieve general, context-aware reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.

Method: Two-stage AdaVaR: a supervised cold-start stage to unify and learn multiple reasoning modes within MoVT, followed by a reinforcement learning stage using AdaGRPO to induce context-driven mode selection.

Result: Empirical studies show AdaVaR enables learning and differentiating multiple modes and performing context-adaptive mode selection, yielding consistent improvements across varied scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT with AdaVaR constitutes a promising approach toward general, context-aware visual reasoning models by integrating multiple reasoning modes and enabling adaptive mode selection.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can exhibit human-like gambling biases and risk-taking that intensify with autonomy; they can be analyzed via cognitive-behavioral and neural-level methods, raising safety concerns for financial AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are adopted in finance, understanding whether they adopt pathological decision-making patterns is crucial for risk management and responsible AI design.

Method: Slot-machine style experiments to identify human gambling biases (illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, loss chasing); allow models to set targets and bets to study autonomy effects; neural analysis with a Sparse Autoencoder to see if abstract decision-making features govern behavior beyond prompts.

Result: Increased autonomy led to higher bankruptcy rates and more irrational behavior; behavior is driven by abstract decision-making features rather than mere prompts; LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases.

Conclusion: AI safety and governance must consider such biases in financial contexts; design safeguards to prevent pathological decision-making in LLMs used for decision support or autonomous trading.

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

### [760] [Hilbert: Recursively Building Formal Proofs with Informal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22819)
*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert is an agentic framework that combines informal reasoning and formal verification to improve Lean 4 proof generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on miniF2F and PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prover LLMs struggle to match general-purpose LLMs in natural language on formal proofs, while informal LLMs can reason but lack guarantees. There is a gap between informal reasoning and formal verification that needs bridging.

Method: Hilbert orchestrates four components: (1) an informal LLM for mathematical reasoning, (2) a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4 tactics, (3) a formal verifier, and (4) a semantic theorem retriever. If the prover cannot solve a problem, Hilbert recursively decomposes it into subgoals solvable by the prover or reasoner LLM, using verifier feedback to refine proofs.

Result: On miniF2F, Hilbert achieves 99.2% (6.6 percentage points above the best publicly available method). It achieves the best known result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming SeedProver (50.4%) and yielding a 422% improvement over the best publicly available baseline.

Conclusion: Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation and sets new state-of-the-art results on important formal-proving benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

### [761] [Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22831)
*Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a five-axis framework for generalizing mechanistic claims across LLMs, and empirically tests 1-back attention across Pythia seeds/sizes, finding strong developmental consistency but limited positional consistency, with larger models showing earlier, steeper, higher 1-back attention; argues for mapping design properties to emergent behaviors to improve generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, there are no clear principles to determine when mechanistic findings on one model generalize to other LLMs, hindering robust interpretability and cross-model insights.

Method: Propose five axes of correspondence—functional, developmental, positional, relational, and configurational—for generalization. Empirically analyze 1-back attention heads (attending to previous tokens) across pretraining seeds for Pythia models at 14M, 70M, 160M, and 410M parameters.

Result: Developmental trajectories of 1-back attention show striking consistency across models; positional consistency is more limited. Seeds of larger models exhibit earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention.

Conclusion: Advancing generalizability in mechanistic interpretability requires mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms; progress hinges on cross-model generalization grounded in these design-property mappings.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

### [762] [JE-IRT: A Geometric Lens on LLM Abilities through Joint Embedding Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22888)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT introduces a shared geometric embedding space for LLMs and questions, where question direction encodes semantics and norm encodes difficulty; model correctness arises from geometric interactions, enabling multidimensional, interpretable evaluation, OOD insights, and scalable generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM evaluation collapses diverse abilities into a single score, obscuring their multidimensional nature; a unified, interpretable framework is needed to capture semantics, difficulty, and their interactions.

Method: Propose JE-IRT: jointly embed LLMs and questions in a common space; semantics are encoded by the direction of question embeddings while difficulty is encoded by their norm; correctness on a question is determined by geometric interaction between model and question embeddings; study out-of-distribution behavior, relation between norm and question difficulty, and generalization by adding new LLMs via a single embedding; analyze an internal taxonomy of LLM abilities.

Result: Directional alignment explains out-of-distribution behavior; larger norms consistently indicate harder questions; the space supports generalization by fitting a single embedding for new LLMs; an LLM-internal taxonomy emerges that only partially aligns with human-defined categories; reveals a unified geometric lens linking abilities to question structure.

Conclusion: JE-IRT provides an interpretable, unified geometric framework for LLM evaluation and generalization, transforming how model abilities are connected to question structure and enabling topical specialization over a single global ranking.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

### [763] [Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984)
*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade improves LLM cascade efficiency by online learning where a strong model distills problem-solving strategies to the weak model, reducing reliance on expensive models and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM cascades are offline and nonadaptive, deferring difficult queries to stronger models but potentially repeatedly invoking the expensive model for similar queries. There's a need for online, reusable knowledge transfer to the weak model to reduce cost and improve performance over time.

Method: An online, interactive cascade where a strong model not only solves difficult queries but also distills its solution into generalized, reusable problem-solving strategies that the weak model can apply on future queries. This in-context knowledge transfer avoids fine-tuning and applies across open-source and API-based LLMs, reducing strong-model calls while boosting weak-model accuracy.

Result: Compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, Inter-Cascade improves the weak model's accuracy by up to 33.06 percentage points and the overall system by up to 5.53 percentage points, while reducing strong-model calls by up to 48.05% and saving fees by up to 49.63%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and provides a general, scalable framework for LLM cascades applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

### [764] [Towards Strategic Persuasion with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22989)
*Zirui Cheng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theory-driven Bayesian Persuasion framework to evaluate and train LLMs in strategic persuasion by repurposing human-human datasets; reinforcement learning boosts persuasion gains, even for small models, with frontier models showing sophisticated tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematically quantify and compare LLM persuasion across domains, addressing variability across human contexts and enabling scalable, principled evaluation and training.

Method: Ground the evaluation in Bayesian Persuasion; repurpose existing human-human persuasion datasets into evaluation/training environments for LLMs; assess frontier models; apply reinforcement learning to optimize LLMs for strategic persuasion within these environments.

Result: Frontier models consistently achieve high persuasion gains and demonstrate sophisticated strategies aligned with theoretical predictions; reinforcement learning yields significant gains in persuasion for both large and small LLMs.

Conclusion: The Bayesian Persuasion framework provides a scalable, principled approach to measuring and training LLM persuasion; RL can enhance persuasive capabilities, raising considerations for deployment, safety, and governance while pointing to directions for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

### [765] [AI Noether -- Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004)
*Karan Srivastava,Sanjeeb Dash,Ryan Cory-Wright,Barry Trager,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Algebraic-geometry-based abductive system that, given an incomplete axiom set and an unexplainable hypothesis, automatically generates a minimal set of missing polynomial axioms to derive the hypothesis; provides necessary/sufficient conditions for retrieval and validates on Kepler's third law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the abduction step in science when existing theory is incomplete or inconsistent with data, enabling derivation of new laws from data by minimally extending axioms.

Method: Use algebraic geometry to operate on polynomial equations representing axioms and hypotheses; compute minimal axiom set that suffices to derive the hypothesis; establish formal necessary and sufficient conditions for successful retrieval.

Result: Demonstrates that the approach can explain Kepler's third law and other laws even when key axioms are missing, showing practical efficacy.

Conclusion: Provides a formal framework for automatic abductive inference in science, enabling principled, minimal axiom extensions to derive new laws from data; potential to augment the scientific method.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

TL;DR: Introduces Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) to examine how well Agentic AI tasks align with system goals, validated via synthetic Alexa-like data; shows alignment insights aiding optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation focuses on identifying suitable agents, tools, and parameters but overlooks alignment between tasks and overarching goals; addressing this gap is essential for safe, effective Agentic AI.

Method: Propose the CAT framework for adversarial/creative testing of agent-task alignment. Validates via extensive simulation using synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, enabling edge-case and failure-mode exploration while preserving user privacy.

Result: CAT yields unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems by revealing where tasks diverge from objectives.

Conclusion: CAT provides a new framework to evaluate alignment in Agentic AI; future work could extend to other domains, integrate formal alignment metrics, and couple with privacy-preserving real-world testing.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

### [767] [Deceive, Detect, and Disclose: Large Language Models Play Mini-Mafia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23023)
*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia is a four-player, role-based social deduction benchmark for LLMs that isolates deception, detection, and disclosure. It uses a two-stage scoring framework and reveals counterintuitive results (e.g., smaller models outperforming larger ones), while enabling analysis of emergent multi-agent dynamics and AI-safety data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a simple, controllable testbed to evaluate social intelligence and theory-of-mind in LLMs under asymmetric information, enabling systematic, data-free benchmarking that scales with new models and supports deception-detection research.

Method: Define a four-player variant (mafioso, detective, two villagers) where the mafioso kills at night and the detective investigates; the day phase is for discussion and voting. The Mini-Mafia Benchmark uses a two-stage evaluation: first estimate win rates within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregate across configurations using standardized scoring. All interactions are model-generated with no external data, and each model serves both as opponent and evaluation subject. The study measures three role-specific capabilities (deception, detection, disclosure) via win conditions and analyzes emergent dynamics.

Result: Experiments show non-monotonic performance (smaller models beating larger ones in some configurations). The framework reveals emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and last-speaker advantage. Mini-Mafia also provides data-generating capabilities for deception detectors and enables benchmarking against human baselines.

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia is a scalable, evolving benchmark for quantitative study of social intelligence and deception in LLMs, with clear applications to AI safety, model evaluation pipelines, and future research into multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

TL;DR: Agentless training builds skill priors that boost SWE Agents; Kimi-Dev tops workflow methods on SWE-bench Verified and, after SFT, matches Claude-3.5 Sonnet on pass@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE benchmarking with LLMs is evolving; bridging workflow (agentless) and agentic paradigms could yield transferable, efficient coding agents.

Method: Curate an Agentless training recipe; develop Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM; evaluate on SWE-bench Verified; apply 5k trajectory SFT to enable SWE-Agents; compare to Claude-3.5 Sonnet.

Result: Kimi-Dev achieves 60.4% Verified on SWE-bench (best among workflow approaches); after 5k trajectory SFT, SWE-Agents reach 48.6% pass@1, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022).

Conclusion: Agentless-derived skill priors can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks, enabling transferable coding agents across SWE tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

### [769] [Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23058)
*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pipeline to elicit, steer, and modulate LLM risk preferences using utility theory; post-training yields the strongest, most stable modulation, while different training stages show distinct adherence to utility models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how training and alignment shapes LLM risk-taking under uncertainty and enable principled risk-aware control via behavioral-economics-inspired methods.

Method: Develop a risk-elicit pipeline; fit utility-theoretic models; compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs; assess modulation techniques including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training.

Result: Instruction-tuned models partially conform to standard utility formulations; pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate from fitted utility models; post-training stands out as the most stable and effective way to modulate risk preference.

Conclusion: Post-training modulation is central for reliable risk control; findings inform behavioral alignment and design of risk-aware LLMs, with avenues for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

*Fang Wu,Xu Huang,Weihao Xuan,Zhiwei Zhang,Yijia Xiao,Guancheng Wan,Xiaomin Li,Bing Hu,Peng Xia,Jure Leskovec,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MNPO generalizes NLHF to multiplayer settings, formulating an n-player Nash game where each policy faces a population of opponents and is regularized toward a reference model. It preserves equilibrium guarantees while enabling richer, heterogeneous preference coverage, improving alignment quality under diverse annotator conditions. Code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world human preferences are non-transitive and heterogeneous. The two-player NLHF framework imposes a single-opponent bias and can miss complex preference structures. A multiplayer Nash framework aims to better capture diverse annotator opinions and non-transitive utilities, while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Define an n-player game where each policy competes against a population of opponents and is regularized toward a reference model. Establish Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings, extend the duality gap to measure approximation quality, and develop MNPO algorithms with these properties. Evaluate on instruction-following benchmarks under heterogeneous annotator settings and mixed-policy evaluations, comparing to existing NLHF baselines.

Result: MNPO outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, delivering superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO provides a principled, scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences by generalizing NLHF to multiplayer Nash games, inheriting equilibrium guarantees and enabling richer competitive dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

### [771] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel cognitive-imagery benchmark shows state-of-the-art LLMs can solve imagery-dependent tasks using text-based reasoning, outperforming average humans; performance improves with more reasoning tokens, suggesting emergent cognitive capacity and raising questions about mental imagery representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe whether large language models possess emergent cognitive capabilities beyond those learned from training data, by testing a task traditionally thought to require visual mental imagery, and to establish a benchmark that challenges non-imagistic reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Develop dozens of novel items from a classic mental imagery task. Provide text-only instructions to LLMs to perform specified transformations and report the final object. Establish a human baseline by testing 100 participants on the same task. Evaluate reasoning models at different levels of reasoning, varying the amount of reasoning tokens.

Result: Best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Higher reasoning-token allocation yielded stronger performance, indicating that more extensive internal deliberation benefits task success. The findings suggest LLMs can complete imagery-dependent tasks despite non-pictorial architectures.

Conclusion: The study reveals emergent cognitive capacities in LLMs for imagery-dependent tasks, offers a new challenging benchmark for model improvement, and rekindles debate on how visual imagery is represented, arguing that propositional or non-imagistic reasoning may suffice.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [772] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention Anchor (AttAnchor) is a parameter-free, mixed-modal token grouping framework that enhances cross-modal locality by clustering semantically similar text and image tokens, inserting semantic signposts near relevant visual patches to guide cross-modal attention. It improves VLM tasks with reduced hallucinations, achieving gains on multiple benchmarks with minimal latency overhead; notably, TinyLLaVA 1B surpasses larger models on POPE with only 0.1% overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of cross-modal attention in vision-language models, where concatenating image and text tokens with modality-blind positional encodings leads to long-distance, semantically weak attention and hallucinations. There is a need for mechanisms that preserve prompt flow while improving local, semantically grounded cross-modal interactions.

Method: Propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that jointly groups text and image tokens into shared semantic clusters. It inserts text tokens near relevant visual patches to create semantic signposts, revealing content-based cross-modal attention scores and guiding the model to focus on correct image regions. The grouping is mixed-modal (text+image) rather than modality-isolated, and aims to improve locality without adding alignment losses or trainable parameters.

Result: AttAnchor yields improvements on 13 of 15 metrics/benchmarks, with up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and about 15% improvements on hallucinatio n benchmarks. TinyLLaVA 1B outperforms LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference-time overhead.

Conclusion: This work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token grouping and demonstrates that parameter-free, cross-modal locality improvements can boost reasoning and reduce hallucinations while maintaining prompt coherence, suggesting a promising direction for efficient VLM improvements.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

### [773] [Exploring LLM-based Frameworks for Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23113)
*Xian Yeow Lee,Lasitha Vidyaratne,Ahmed Farahat,Chetan Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based fault detection in sensor-rich industrial settings can achieve strong performance when fed summarized statistical inputs; employing multiple specialized LLMs improves fault classification sensitivity; while outputs can be explainable, continual learning and calibration across repeated fault cycles remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous, transparent fault diagnosis in harsh, sensor-rich industrial environments by leveraging LLMs to interpret data and generate natural-language explanations.

Method: Systematic evaluation across (a) LLM architecture (single vs. multi-LLM), (b) input representation (raw sensor data vs. descriptive statistics), and (c) context window size, assessing diagnostic performance and explainability.

Result: Best performance arises with summarized statistical inputs; multi-LLM systems with specialized prompts show increased sensitivity for fault classification compared to single-LLM systems; LLMs can provide detailed, human-readable justifications; limitations include limited adaptability and calibration in continual learning contexts across repeated fault cycles.

Conclusion: LLM-based diagnostic systems hold promise as transparent, adaptive tools in complex environments, but practical deployment must address current boundaries in continual learning and prediction calibration over time.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

*Shuai Li,Chen Yizhe,Li Dong,Liu Sichao,Lan Dapeng,Liu Yu,Zhibo Pang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLA models show potential for simple grasping in industrial settings after fine-tuning but struggle with complex environments, diverse objects, and high-precision placing; deployment is limited by data collection and model architecture; task-specific enhancements are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess industrial readiness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and identify gaps to guide practical deployment in real-world industry.

Method: Empirical comparison of state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios; analysis of limitations from data collection and architecture perspectives; evaluation of fine-tuning effects on grasping tasks.

Result: VLA models retain the ability for simple grasping after fine-tuning in industrial settings; performance gaps remain for complex environments, diverse object categories, and high-precision placing; significant room for improvement; practical deployment requires task-specific enhancements to improve robustness, generalization, and precision.

Conclusion: VLA models are adaptable to industrial use but are not yet robust enough for broad deployment; progress hinges on better data strategies, architectural adjustments, and task-specific modules to boost robustness, generalization, and precision.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

*Qian Cheng,Ruize Tang,Emilie Ma,Finn Hackett,Peiyang He,Yiming Su,Ivan Beschastnikh,Yu Huang,Xiaoxing Ma,Tianyin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SysMoBench is a benchmark to test AI's ability to formally model large, concurrent/distributed systems in TLA+, with automated metrics across nine artifacts, enabling evaluation of current AI capabilities and guiding future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal models are essential for correct specification of large systems but expensive to write/maintain; AI could assist, but it is unclear if it can handle realistic system artifacts. A benchmark is needed to quantify AI's capabilities and guide progress.

Method: Target the TLA+ specification language and automate metrics such as syntactic/runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench comprises diverse artifacts (e.g., Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, Spinlock/Mutex in Asterinas OS) and is extensible to other languages.

Result: The work proposes and designs SysMoBench, along with its evaluation metrics and an initial set of artifacts. No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the contribution is the benchmark framework and its intended evaluation approach.

Conclusion: SysMoBench provides a foundation to assess current AI-generated formal models for large, complex systems, highlighting capabilities/limitations of today’s LLMs and guiding future research directions.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

### [776] [MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23143)
*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode introduces a dynamic, frequency-domain diagnostic for LLM mathematical reasoning that uses sinusoidal perturbations to extract gain and phase, yielding interpretable fingerprints that reveal reasoning dynamics beyond accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accuracy-only benchmarks miss the dynamic behavior of mathematical reasoning in LLMs. A reproducible, interpretable protocol is needed to measure reasoning fidelity and consistency.

Method: Treat each parametric problem as a system; perturb a single parameter sinusoidally and fit the first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions to obtain gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag). Evaluate across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles); compare models against a symbolic baseline to calibrate the instrument (G ≈ 1, φ ≈ 0); produce diagnostic surfaces.

Result: The diagnostic reveals systematic low-pass behavior and increasing phase lag not evident from accuracy alone, enabling separation of frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics; provides a compact, reproducible protocol for measuring reasoning fidelity and consistency; calibration against a symbolic baseline helps interpret outputs.

Conclusion: MathBode offers interpretable, Bode-style fingerprints of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, complementing standard benchmarks with actionable measurements; code and dataset are open-sourced to foster adoption and further research.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

### [777] [Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144)
*Atma Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) shows that coordinating multi-agent objectives imposes an information-loss–driven minimum description length that grows with N, K, d, and decreasing precision ε; this forces simplification, causes metastability and phase transitions, and offers a unifying explanation for challenges in ML alignment and multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify fundamental thermodynamic constraints on coordination across agents with potentially conflicting objectives and to explain why coordination focal points are fragile, require information loss, and lead to dynamic, hierarchical organization across systems.

Method: Derives an information-theoretic lower bound on the description length L(P) ≥ NK log2 K + N^2 d^2 log(1/ε); introduces a coordination temperature; analyzes how coordination dynamics alter the environment, induce hierarchical optimization, metastable states, and phase transitions via spontaneous symmetry breaking; extends a topological Arrow’s theorem to bound aggregated preferences; suggests broad, cross-domain signatures and links to ML alignment and RLHF.

Result: The bound implies progressive simplification and that coordination costs grow with the number of agents, objectives, and complexity; coordination dynamics can reshape the environment, create persistent metastable states and hysteresis, and trigger phase transitions; practical signatures are expected across systems from neural networks to bureaucracies; Arrow’s theorem binds recursively as preferences are combined; potential explanations for gradient-descent cycling and alignment faking in RLHF.

Conclusion: Thermodynamic Coordination Theory reveals that achieving coordination inherently requires radical information loss, unifying diverse multi-agent phenomena under a thermodynamic lens and predicting when coordination will be costly, unstable, or undergo critical transitions across domains.

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

*Jinzhe Pan,Jingqing Wang,Yuehui Ouyang,Wenchi Cheng,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize dynamic backoff in unlicensed bands, reducing collisions and improving fairness while maintaining legacy Wi‑Fi compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary exponential backoff (BEB) causes suboptimal collision handling in dense deployments and fairness issues across heterogeneous devices; new distributed access mechanisms are needed that coexist with legacy systems.

Method: Dynamic backoff selection tied to real-time channel conditions and access deferral with full CSMA/CA compatibility; a fairness metric aligned with EDCA; centralized training/decentralized execution (CTDE) using neighborhood activity as inputs, optimized via constrained MAPPO to minimize collisions and enforce fairness.

Result: Experiments show significantly lower collision probability versus BEB; backward compatibility with commercial Wi‑Fi devices is preserved; the fairness metric mitigates starvation in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: AI-guided, fairness-aware CSMA/CA with CTDE-MAPPO can enhance dense WLAN performance without disrupting legacy devices; the proposed framework offers practical coexistence benefits and a principled fairness guarantee.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes information propagation rules for Transformer-based models and derives theoretical bounds on single-pass reasoning depth, showing the limit number of steps scales between O(3^{L-1}) and O(2^{L-1}) for a model with L attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intrinsic reasoning mechanisms of Transformers and establish theoretical limits on their reasoning depth using a formal framework.

Method: Introduce information propagation rules tailored to Transformer architectures and analyze symbolic reasoning tasks to theoretically bound the maximum number of reasoning steps achievable in a single forward pass.

Result: The limit number of reasoning steps in a single-pass Transformer with L attention layers is bounded between O(3^{L-1}) and O(2^{L-1}).

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical framework linking Transformer architecture (number of layers) to reasoning capacity in a single pass, outlining exponential bounds and highlighting the remaining gaps in understanding Transformer reasoning dynamics.

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to
theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number
of reasoning steps is between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ for a model with
$L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

### [780] [Understanding and Enhancing the Planning Capability of Language Models via Multi-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23186)
*Qimin Zhong,Hao Liao,Siwei Wang,Mingyang Zhou,Xiaoqun Wu,Rui Mao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) in Transformers to tackle learning transitive relations for planning. It shows a transfer layer can gradually learn multi-step adjacency, enabling reachability beyond training data with some noise, and proposes Next-Token Injection and a Transformer-based transfer layer, with experiments on synthetic graphs and Blocksworld to improve path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitive relations are crucial for complex planning but often poorly learned by LLMs. The paper investigates whether MTP and a dedicated transfer layer can internalize multi-step connectivity to enhance planning capabilities.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of a Transformer architecture with a shared output head and a transfer layer under the MTP regime. They show how the transfer layer captures multi-step adjacency information and propose two enhancements: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer. They validate their theory with experiments on synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark.

Result: The transfer layer progressively learns multi-step adjacency, enabling the backbone to infer transitive reachability beyond direct training data, albeit with some noise. The proposed NTI and a Transformer-based transfer layer improve the model's path-planning performance, as demonstrated on synthetic graphs and Blocksworld, supporting the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Transformers trained with MTP can learn transitive relations through a transfer layer, and targeted enhancements (NTI and a Transformer-based transfer layer) can alleviate the transitivity bottleneck, yielding more capable, structurally aware planning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

*Zhenxing Xu,Yizhe Zhang,Weidong Bao,Hao Wang,Ming Chen,Haoran Ye,Wenzheng Jiang,Hui Yan,Ji Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEP is a zero-shot, LLM-driven framework that autonomously tunes hyperparameters for metaheuristics in real-time by combining an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module with multi-LLM reasoning, achieving superior performance without training and enabling open-source models to match GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in computational intelligence is sample-inefficient when using learning-based methods and suffers from poor generalization. A training-free, data-grounded approach is needed to adapt hyperparameters in real time.

Method: AutoEP uses (1) an online ELA module that provides real-time feedback on search dynamics and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies in a zero-shot setting, mitigating hallucinations by grounding reasoning in empirical data. Evaluated on three metaheuristics and diverse combinatorial benchmarks.

Result: AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural-evolution and other LLM-based methods. Open-source Qwen3-30B achieves GPT-4-level performance on these tasks. Code available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a powerful, accessible paradigm for automated hyperparameter design that reduces training requirements, scales across models, and broadens the practical use of LLMs for algorithm control.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

### [782] [$p$-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23234)
*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hyperparameter-free, information-theoretic decoding method called p-less sampling dynamically truncates the per-step token distribution to select the next token, yielding robust, high-quality outputs across tasks and temperatures with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based decoding for LLMs relies on hyperparameters (e.g., temperature, top-p/top-k) that must be tuned for different tasks and configurations. There is a need for a universal, hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that maintains quality as temperature varies.

Method: p-less sampling introduces a dynamic truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the complete token probability distribution, without any hyperparameters. The approach is grounded in information theory, and the authors validate it theoretically and empirically across math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks, demonstrating higher efficiency via shorter sampling times and generation lengths.

Result: p-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling methods, showing less degradation in text quality at higher temperatures, and achieving greater inference-time efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative analyses, case studies, and diversity assessments corroborate the improvements.

Conclusion: p-less sampling offers a robust, hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that improves output quality and efficiency across tasks and temperature regimes, suggesting it as a strong default alternative to traditional sampling methods.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

TL;DR: A joint optimization framework enabling efficient LLM reasoning on MEGI by combining adaptive CoT prompting and distributed MoE, with dynamic reasoning depth, to balance quality and resource use in edge environments, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, privacy-preserving LLM-based agentic AI at mobile network edges, addressing the high computational demands and limited resources of edge devices.

Method: Review reasoning-enhancement methods (Chain-of-Thought prompting, SFT, Mixture of Experts) and present a distributed framework that adaptively activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity and device capabilities; uses distributed MoE to scale deployment in MEGI; includes experimental evaluation in mobile edge environments.

Result: The framework demonstrates a favorable balance between reasoning quality and resource efficiency in MEGI settings, showing practical viability for deploying advanced LLM reasoning on resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization framework enables efficient, real-time, and privacy-preserving LLM reasoning on MEGI, enabling broader deployment of sophisticated agentic AI at the network edge; suggests directions for improved adaptive prompting and scalable MoE deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

### [784] [Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250)
*Brandon Ong,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,William Chandra Tjhi,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work studies Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs), introducing a hybrid data-synthesis pipeline (MCTS + strong VLM judgments), perception-focused supervision for visual-grounding errors, and a range of test-time scaling (TTS) strategies. Across five multimodal benchmarks, ORM-based TTS often outperforms step-based policy selection; smaller VL-PRMs can match or exceed larger ones in error detection; VL-PRMs reveal latent reasoning in stronger backbones; perception supervision yields large gains; and TTS policies improve advanced math reasoning on unseen datasets without training VL-PRMs there.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VL-PRMs promise step-level supervision for reliable reasoning in large language models, but extending them to Vision-Language Models faces noisy supervision from MCTS and limited cross-task generalization. This work aims to map the design space of VL-PRMs across data construction, supervision signals, and test-time strategies to improve VLM reasoning.

Method: 1) Propose a hybrid data-synthesis framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with judgments from a strong VLM to produce more accurate step-level labels. 2) Introduce perception-focused supervision to explicitly detect errors at the visual-grounding stage of reasoning. 3) Systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies to guide VLMs toward better solutions. 4) Empirically evaluate on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, MathVision).

Result: Key empirical findings: (i) Using VL-PRMs as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process-step selection. (ii) Smaller VL-PRMs can match or surpass larger ones in detecting process errors. (iii) VL-PRMs reveal latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones. (iv) Perception-level supervision yields significant gains in TTS. (v) TTS policy performance improves on advanced math datasets even without training VL-PRMs on those datasets.

Conclusion: The study maps the VL-PRM design space, showing that hybrid data synthesis, perception-focused supervision, and ORM-based TTS can meaningfully improve VLM reasoning. The findings encourage further research and generalization of VL-PRMs across tasks and backbones.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

TL;DR: GUI-PRA introduces a dynamic memory and UI-perception-based judge to guide GUI agents using Process Reward Models, addressing long-horizon and UI-dynamics challenges.


<details>

Motivation: PRMs struggle in GUI due to long history context ('lost in the middle') and lack of UI-change awareness; GUI tasks are dynamic and require grounded evaluation tied to current UI state.

Method: Proposes GUI-PRA with two modules: Relevance-based Retrieval to fetch pertinent history; Progressive Summarization to condense data; Adaptive UI Perception to observe UI changes and select appropriate grounding tools; integrates with MLLMs for process rewards in GUI tasks.

Result: Abstract presents architectural contribution and proposed method; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA offers a pathway to more robust process reward signals in GUI tasks by focusing on relevant context and dynamic UI state, potentially improving long-horizon task performance for GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

### [786] [Socio-Economic Model of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23270)
*Yuxinyue Qian,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-human collaboration in a heterogeneous agent-based model increases aggregate output, with network effects yielding nonlinear gains and increasing returns; independent producers show stronger long-term growth potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI integration with human labor affects macro-scale productivity and growth under resource constraints, particularly when agent interactions and production modes vary.

Method: Develop five progressively extended agent-based models: (1) baseline human collaboration; (2) add AI collaborators; (3) include network effects among agents; (4) model agents as independent producers; (5) combine network effects with independent production. Use theoretical derivations and simulation analyses to compare outcomes.

Result: AI agents boost aggregate social output; network effects lead to nonlinear, super-additive increases beyond the sum of individual contributions; under equal resources, independent-producer modeling yields higher long-term growth, and network effects further amplify growth, showing increasing returns to scale.

Conclusion: Integrating AI with human agents can substantially raise productivity, with network structures and producer autonomy enhancing returns. Policy or design implications include leveraging AI collaboration and network effects to maximize growth, while considering resource constraints.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

### [787] [Toward Effective Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Self-Evolved Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23285)
*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tool-Light improves efficiency and accuracy of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in LLMs by entropy-aware data collection and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline, guided by information-entropy changes from tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal tool usage, excessive or insufficient tool calls, and unstable reasoning in TIR, by understanding how tool calls affect reasoning entropy and by training models to use tools more efficiently.

Method: First analyze how tool calls affect information entropy in the reasoning chain. Then develop Tool-Light with dataset construction via continuous self-evolved sampling that blends vanilla and entropy-guided sampling and enforces strict positive/negative pair criteria. Train in two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Evaluate on 10 datasets to assess efficiency and accuracy of TIR.

Result: Tool-Light demonstrated significant improvements in the efficiency of performing TIR tasks across 10 datasets, indicating more efficient and potentially more accurate use of tools during reasoning.

Conclusion: Entropy-aware, self-evolved sampling combined with a two-stage training regimen can stabilize and enhance tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs, reducing unnecessary tool usage while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage pattern-aware framework for tool-integrated reasoning that addresses misaligned tool usage by focusing on calculator and algorithmic patterns; shows significant Code@1 gains on math datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on tool-integrated reasoning mostly examines when to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied; misaligned tool usage can waste reasoning efforts and cause failures.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: (1) build code competence from two common tool-use patterns (calculator and algorithmic patterns); (2) align pattern selection with teacher preferences to improve tool usage and reasoning accuracy.

Result: Across challenging math datasets, pattern-aware method improves code usage and accuracy, e.g., Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Conclusion: A pattern-aware approach effectively enhances tool-integrated reasoning by ensuring tool-use patterns align with task demands and teacher preferences.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Just-Enough Thinking (JET) trains large reasoning models to terminate unnecessary reasoning early by truncating reasoning trajectories during rollout and using a quality-controlled length reward, achieving shorter and distributionally consistent reasoning paths without sacrificing accuracy; on Olympiad tasks, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B shows a 4.6% accuracy gain with 46.3% shorter outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models incur high computational costs due to deep reasoning. Existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle to learn short, efficient reasoning paths. Inspired by evidence accumulation models, there is a potential to terminate reasoning once sufficient information has been gathered.

Method: Introduce Just-Enough Thinking (JET): during rollout, perform trajectory truncation to produce short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths; train with a quality-controlled length reward to encourage concise yet correct reasoning.

Result: JET substantially improves reasoning efficiency without reducing accuracy. In experiments, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6% accuracy gain and a 46.3% reduction in output length on the Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: JET offers an effective approach to reducing computation in large reasoning models by enabling proactive early termination of reasoning while preserving performance; code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.
Our code is available in the GitHub.

*Gyubok Lee,Woosog Chay,Heeyoung Kwak,Yeong Hwa Kim,Haanju Yoo,Oksoon Jeong,Meong Hi Son,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces EHR-ChatQA, a benchmark for end-to-end database agents in EHR data access, focusing on clarifying ambiguous questions and resolving value mismatches; evaluates two interaction flows (IncreQA and AdaptQA) with LLM-based users; finds high Pass@5 but much lower Pass^5, highlighting robustness and safety needs; offers diagnostic failure-mode insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks that capture realistic clinical data access workflows for LLM-powered database agents, particularly addressing query ambiguity and terminology-to-database value gaps in EHRs.

Method: A simulated, interactive benchmark (EHR-ChatQA) with an LLM-based user across two flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA). Agents must clarify questions, resolve value mismatches with tools, and generate correct SQL. Evaluation spans five i.i.d. trials using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash).

Result: Agents attain Pass@5 of 90–95% on IncreQA and 60–80% on AdaptQA; Pass^5 is substantially lower by 35–60%, indicating robustness gaps across trials.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes that high performance is insufficient for safety-critical EHR deployments; there is a clear need for more robust, interpretable agents, and it provides diagnostic insights into common failure modes to guide future development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

TL;DR: ToolUniverse provides an open ecosystem to build AI scientists by standardizing tool usage and integrating hundreds of tools, enabling automated tool refinement and workflow assembly, demonstrated by a hypercholesterolemia case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI scientists lack a shared, interoperable infrastructure; the paper draws on the success of omics ecosystems to argue for a unified environment that enables discovery, reproducibility, and reuse.

Method: Introduce ToolUniverse that standardizes tool discovery, calling, and interface refinement; supports any language or model; integrates 600+ models/datasets/APIs/packages; auto-refines interfaces; creates tools from NL descriptions; iteratively optimizes tool specs; composes tools into agentic workflows; demonstrates in hypercholesterolemia case study.

Result: Constructed an AI scientist within ToolUniverse that identified a potent drug analog with favorable predicted properties; ongoing open-source platform with community contributions.

Conclusion: ToolUniverse offers a scalable, interoperable ecosystem for AI scientists, enabling rapid construction and reuse of tools and workflows, aligning with improvements seen in omics ecosystems; released as open-source.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative
partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are
bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of

*Charles E. Gagnon,Steven H. H. Ding,Philippe Charland,Benjamin C. M. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent analyzes assembly to produce human-readable features for cross-architecture/code similarity, achieving competitive recall without training; when combined with embeddings, it surpasses SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for interpretable, generalizable, scalable binary code similarity; hand-crafted features are limited; embeddings lack interpretability and require costly NN search; balance trade-offs.

Method: Use a language-model-based agent to perform structured reasoning on assembly code to extract features: input/output types, side effects, constants, algorithmic intent; these features are human-readable and indexable; no training data required for matching; can be combined with embeddings.

Result: Recall@1: 42% cross-architecture, 62% cross-optimization; embeddings alone achieve 39% and 34%; combined with embeddings, surpasses state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Interpretability, generalizability, and scalability can coexist; the proposed feature-based approach complements embeddings and improves overall performance; highlights the potential of analysis-driven features for binary code similarity.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

*Zhuoli Yin,Yi Ding,Reem Khir,Hua Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP harnesses pre-trained vision-language models to visually identify small-scale subproblems within a large TSP instance and solves them with an off-the-shelf solver, achieving high-quality solutions without user-side training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alleviate scalability and generalization issues in TSP solving by avoiding task-specific training and leveraging powerful pre-trained multimodal models to guide traditional optimization.

Method: Visualize a TSP instance; use pre-trained vision-language models to locate promising small subproblems; apply an off-the-shelf solver to these subproblems to improve the global solution; no additional model training required at user end; designed to work under a fixed runtime budget; tested on real-world instances with 1k–88k nodes.

Result: Average optimality gaps <0.2%; outperforms learning-based methods; within the same runtime budget, reduces LKH-3 gaps by 12%–100%, especially on very large instances (>10k nodes).

Conclusion: Hybridizes pre-trained generative models with traditional OR solvers to tackle large-scale combinatorial optimization; offers practical, scalable integration for logistics systems, avoiding heavy training while delivering strong performance.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Geo-Bias Scores (GeoBS), an information-theoretic, model-agnostic, spatially explicit framework to quantify geographic bias in AI models, with three new geo-bias scores and extensive experiments across tasks, datasets, and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a model-agnostic, spatially explicit geo-bias evaluation framework to fairly compare geographic bias across AI models and to understand which spatial factors contribute to geo-bias; existing measures are either model-specific or spatially implicit.

Method: Introduce an information-theoretic framework (GeoBS) for geo-bias evaluation; show how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures within this framework; propose three novel geo-bias scores that account for multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy; conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models to reveal geo-bias in task-specific GeoAI models and foundation models.

Result: Demonstrates that various geo-bias types affect both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models; provides a unifying framework to interpret geo-bias measures and a practical set of scores to quantify spatial bias; supports integration of spatial fairness into AI system design and evaluation.

Conclusion: GeoBS advances the technical understanding of geographic bias and lays a foundation for incorporating spatial fairness into the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

*Tom Quilter,Anastasia Ilick,Anastasia Ilick,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Largest open dataset of formal math exam responses; introduces a discrete variational inference framework built on Item Response Theory (IRT) for predicting student answers; achieves >80% accuracy and shows that a single latent ability suffices when using collaborative filtering with topic-level skill profiles; outperforms classical IRT and matrix factorization baselines, especially in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat social inequality in education by enabling scalable, affordable AI tutoring that can reliably predict student performance, particularly in data-sparse environments.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) and introduces a novel discrete variational inference algorithm. They also build collaborative filtering models with topic-level skill profiles but find that a single latent ability parameter suffices for maximum predictive accuracy. They release the largest open dataset of professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date.

Result: Achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting whether a student will answer a question correctly on formal math exams; outperforms classical IRT and matrix factorisation baselines; the discrete variational framework yields the best performance in low-data settings.

Conclusion: The work provides a new benchmark dataset and a powerful inference approach for adaptive tutoring, showing that a simplified latent structure (one latent ability) can be sufficient for high prediction accuracy, with implications for scalable AI tutors and education equity; suggests directions for applying discrete variational inference to educational data.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

### [796] [Mapping Overlaps in Benchmarks through Perplexity in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23488)
*Siyang Wu,Honglin Bao,Sida Li,Ari Holtzman,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Benchmark signatures—salient tokens whose perplexity tracks pre-training exposure—predict LLM benchmark performance and reveal cross-domain overlaps in capabilities, with coding showing the least overlap and format biases largely mitigated by signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-training exposure shapes benchmark outcomes, disentangle overlaps among benchmarks, and provide a robust, mechanistic view of LLM capabilities beyond raw scores.

Method: Define benchmark signatures as salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild corpora; use token perplexity as a proxy for pre-training exposure; perform a large-scale meta-evaluation across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks; apply stepwise forward selection with linear regression to extract signature token sets; analyze overlaps in knowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, and culture, and assess the impact of question format.

Result: Benchmark signatures reliably capture variation, overlap, and divergence across tasks. Performance overlaps are high, semantic overlaps are mid-range. Knowledge and reasoning subtasks show overlap; multilingual and cultural benchmarks are less similar. Coding emerges as the least overlapping domain. Signatures remain robust to benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, though performance is still influenced by these factors.

Conclusion: Signature-based diagnostics illuminate the mechanistic structure of LLM capabilities and benchmark validity, revealing cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, while highlighting coding as comparatively distinct. This framework clarifies why benchmarks diverge and how pre-training exposure shapes evaluation, offering a robust lens beyond traditional benchmark agreement studies.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

*Bruno M. Henrique,Eugene Santos Jr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a dynamic, standardized trust calibration measure using Contextual Bandits to decide when to trust AI, improving decision performance by 10-38% across datasets; addresses standardization and the gap between opinion formation and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of objective, generalizable metrics for trust calibration between humans and AI, enabling more reliable and effective human-AI decision-making in critical domains.

Method: Proposes a standardized trust calibration indicator and leverages Contextual Bandits to incorporate contextual information into trust decisions. Evaluated on three diverse datasets, measuring impacts on decision reward.

Result: The trust calibration indicator enables better human-AI decision-making, yielding a 10–38% increase in reward metrics across datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides both theoretical and practical advances for trustworthy AI in decision-support, offering a generalizable metric and an adaptive method to calibrate trust in real time.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

### [798] [Model Consistency as a Cheap yet Predictive Proxy for LLM Elo Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23510)
*Ashwin Ramaswamy,Nestor Demeure,Ermal Rrapaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method to estimate Elo scores cheaply by using an LLM to judge model matchups, achieving about 91% correlation with human Elo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating new and numerous LLMs is expensive; traditional Elo requires human comparisons. A cheap, independent metric would enable scalable evaluation.

Method: Ask an LLM to judge the outcomes of model matchups and identify the best model in each pairing; measure the consistency of its top-choice across contests and correlate this with human Elo scores to obtain a proxy.

Result: The LLM’s judgments are 91% correlated with human-produced Elo scores, providing a cheap, data-free proxy for Elo.

Conclusion: This approach offers a simple, low-cost alternative for Elo estimation that does not require human data or prior knowledge, enabling scalable evaluation of new models.

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Jiayao Tang,Young Min Cho,Xueqian Li,Qiang Yi,Ji Wang,Zhunping Zhang,Danrui Qi,Sharath Chandra Guntuku,Lyle Ungar,Tianyu Shi,Chi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-turn LLM orchestration among several agents improves consensus performance over single-model baselines, with authorship visibility and ongoing vote visibility affecting dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how orchestrating multiple LLM agents over multiple turns compares to single-model baselines and to study how visibility of authorship and votes affects convergence.

Method: Empirically benchmark four LLM agents (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, MuSR with two experiments: orchestration vs baselines; ablations on GPQA-Diamond varying information visibility.

Result: Orchestration matches or exceeds strongest single model and outperforms others; best-achievable orchestration shows room for gains; revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties; showing ongoing votes amplifies herding and speeds convergence but risks premature consensus.

Conclusion: Multi-turn orchestration is a viable strategy to boost performance in multi-agent LLM settings, with dynamics influenced by information visibility; further improvements possible.

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

### [801] [Formalization Driven LLM Prompt Jailbreaking via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23558)
*Zhaoqi Wang,Daqing He,Zijian Zhang,Xin Li,Liehuang Zhu,Meng Li,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS is a framework that weaponizes jailbreak prompts by first transforming them into formal semantic/structural descriptions via reinforcement learning, then embedding these descriptions into a GraphRAG context to produce more effective jailbreaks against LLM alignment defenses, with empirical success on common open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment methods by designing stealthy, potent jailbreaks and assess the limits of defenses against prompt jailbreaks.

Method: 1) Use reinforcement learning to convert initial jailbreak prompts into formalized semantic/structural descriptions. 2) Build a GraphRAG system that uses extracted terms and formal symbols as contextual input together with the original prompt to enhance attack effectiveness and bypass defenses.

Result: Extensive experiments on common open-source LLMs demonstrate the attack's effectiveness and ability to bypass existing alignment defenses.

Conclusion: PASS reveals persistent LLM alignment vulnerabilities and suggests the need for stronger, more robust defenses; the combination of semantic/structural formalization and GraphRAG context enables more stealthy and successful jailbreaks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

### [802] [A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560)
*ChaoBo Zhang,Long Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A KG-diffusion-based, hierarchical, personalized recommender for traditional Chinese medicine formulas (TCM-HEDPR) that tackles personalization gaps, long-tailed herb distribution, and herb-compatibility to improve syndrome differentiation and safety; validated on multiple datasets with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TCM prescription modeling focuses on symptom–herb mappings but neglects patient-specific factors (age, BMI, medical history), suffers from long-tailed herb data that biases learning, and overlooks the monarch–minister–assistant–envoy compatibility among herbs, risking toxicity and misalignment with syndrome differentiation. This motivates a personalized, safe, and generalizable approach guided by knowledge graphs.

Method: 1) Pre-train symptom representations via patient-personalized prompt sequences and use prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. 2) Apply a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion with self-attention to capture non-linear symptom–herb relationships globally. 3) Build a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, enabling fine-grained prescription generation and addressing long-tail data distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset show the method's effectiveness; the evaluation is complemented by insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to assess prescriptions comprehensively.

Conclusion: TCM-HEDPR offers a new paradigm for modern TCM prescription recommendation, combining personalization, safety, and robust generalization through graph diffusion and hierarchical heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

*Min-Hsuan Yeh,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First comprehensive benchmark (PrefCleanBench) for evaluating 13 automated preference data cleaning methods in LLM alignment, showing data cleaning quality critically influences alignment performance and generalization; provides a standardized protocol and modular implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is essential for aligning LLMs but is often noisy/inconsistent, degrading reward models and alignment. A systematic, scalable evaluation of automated data cleaning methods is needed to understand their effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: Introduces PrefCleanBench, a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms, evaluating 13 cleaning methods. Provides modular, released implementations to enable reproducibility and broad testing.

Result: Benchmarks reveal key factors that determine success of data cleaning in alignment tasks and show how effectiveness generalizes across datasets, architectures, and optimizers. The study highlights the importance of data preprocessing for robust LLM alignment and offers guidance for principled cleaning strategies.

Conclusion: Data preprocessing plays a crucial, underappreciated role in responsible AI development. PrefCleanBench establishes a foundation for reproducible evaluation and improvement of alignment pipelines through better data quality and cleaning methods, with released code to catalyze future research.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

### [804] [BridgeDrive: Diffusion Bridge Policy for Closed-Loop Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23589)
*Shu Liu,Wenlin Chen,Weihao Li,Zheng Wang,Lijin Yang,Jianing Huang,Yipin Zhang,Zhongzhan Huang,Ze Cheng,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BridgeDrive introduces an anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning that overcomes truncation-based guidance and enables real-time deployment with ODE solvers, achieving state-of-the-art on Bench2Drive with a ~5% improvement in success rate over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based planners can capture multi-modal driving behaviors but struggle to provide effective guidance in reactive, closed-loop settings. Simple conditioning often falls short in dynamic traffic; anchor-based guidance with truncated schedules brings theoretical issues and performance compromises.

Method: A principled diffusion bridge framework that translates high-level anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans. It supports anchor-guided diffusion without truncation, integrates with efficient ODE solvers for real-time deployment, and adjusts to varying traffic conditions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, with a 5% improvement in success rate over prior arts.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive offers a theoretically sound and practically efficient anchor-guided diffusion approach for reactive autonomous driving, improving robustness and real-time planning under dynamic traffic conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

### [805] [PSG-Agent: Personality-Aware Safety Guardrail for LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23614)
*Yaozu Wu,Jizhou Guo,Dongyuan Li,Henry Peng Zou,Wei-Chieh Huang,Yankai Chen,Zhen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Yangning Li,Meng Zhang,Renhe Jiang,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PSG-Agent introduces a personalized, multi-guardrail framework for LLM agents that tracks user-specific risk across turns using history-informed traits and real-time states, plus continuous monitoring via specialized guards, to outperform existing guardrails in healthcare, finance, and daily life contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guardrails treat all users identically and evaluate risks per response, ignoring cross-turn risk evolution and user-specific sensitivity. This work targets personalized safety and termination of risky trajectories across an agent’s lifecycle.

Method: Develop PSG-Agent with two core components: (1) Personalized guardrails derived from mining user interaction history to identify stable traits and current query states, enabling user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies; (2) Continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline using Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, and Memory Guardian to track cross-turn risk accumulation and provide verifiable verdicts.

Result: Empirical validation across healthcare, finance, and daily-life automation with diverse user profiles shows PSG-Agent significantly outperforms existing guardrails (e.g., LlamaGuard3, AGrail) and offers an executable, auditable pathway toward personalized safety.

Conclusion: PSG-Agent advances personalized safety for LLM-based agents by integrating history-informed guardrails with cross-turn monitoring, enabling more nuanced and auditable safety guarantees than uniform, per-response systems.

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

### [806] [Reasoning Scaffolding: Distilling the Flow of Thought from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23619)
*Xiangyu Wen,Junhua Huang,Zeju Li,Min Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Zhijian Xu,Mingxuan Yuan,Yongxiang Huang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Reasoning Scaffolding to replace text-based distillation; abstracts reasoning into discrete semantic signals and trains a multi-task student to predict signals and generate steps, improving accuracy and logical consistency over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation from LLMs via textual rationales tends to mimic surface patterns rather than underlying algorithmic reasoning; there is a need to transfer the actual computational structure of thought to smaller models to achieve genuine reasoning.

Method: Reasoning Scaffolding framework: convert teacher reasoning into a sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition); train the student with a multi-task objective to (1) predict the next semantic signal and (2) generate the corresponding step conditioned on that signal, providing a strong regularizer for internalizing reasoning patterns.

Result: On challenging reasoning benchmarks, the approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation in accuracy and logical consistency, suggesting smaller models can become genuine reasoners rather than fluent mimics.

Conclusion: Shifting distillation from text to an algorithmic scaffolding of reasoning enables smaller models to reason more robustly, offering a path toward genuinely reasoning machines rather than surface-level imitators.

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified theory explains RLVR behaviors as self-organizing sparse semantic networks; introduces Annealed-RLVR with SFT heating, yielding improved reasoning and performance on 1.5B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain puzzling RLVR behaviors (two-stage learning, V-shaped trajectories, catastrophic forgetting) with a single theory of semantic network self-organization and persistent sparsity.

Method: Proposes a model mapping reasoning to a sparse semantic complex network with average degree ~2; identifies phases: maximal frustration with skill islands and slow learning, followed by a sharp growth phase via frontier-driven phase transitions; develops Annealed-RLVR that uses an SFT-based heating step at maximal frustration to overcome bottlenecks.

Result: Empirical evidence on a 1.5B-parameter model showing Annealed-RLVR outperforms standard RLVR on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: Frames RLVR as a predictable process of structural self-organization, offering a physical intuition for engineering future AI emergent reasoning capabilities; suggests annealing as a general mechanism to enhance learning under competition and forgetting.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GO-AEC framework enhances gaming ASR by combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and LLM/TTS-based data augmentation, plus N-best correction and a dynamic game knowledge base, achieving notable reductions in CER and SER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time voice in multiplayer games is crucial for coordination, but general ASR struggles with gaming-specific challenges (short phrases, fast speech, jargon, noise). A specialized solution is needed to improve recognition accuracy in gaming scenarios.

Method: GO-AEC integrates large language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and text-to-speech (TTS). It comprises data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge base to adapt to gaming vocabularies and contexts.

Result: Experiment results show the framework reduces character error rate by 6.22% and sentence error rate by 29.71%, indicating significant improvements in ASR accuracy for gaming speech.

Conclusion: GO-AEC significantly improves ASR accuracy in gaming scenarios, enabling better real-time communication and team coordination in multiplayer online games.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data
augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge
base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

### [809] [From Reasoning to Answer: Empirical, Attention-Based and Mechanistic Insights into Distilled DeepSeek R1 Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23676)
*Jue Zhang,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Explicit intermediate reasoning in large reasoning models causally shapes final answers; a three-stage study shows improved answer quality, attentive use of reasoning traces, and causal influence via activation interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how intermediate reasoning traces contribute to answer generation in LRMs, addressing whether reasoning tokens are functionally used rather than merely displayed.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) empirical evaluation across diverse domains using distilled DeepSeek R1 models to compare answers with/without explicit reasoning; (2) analysis of attention patterns showing answer tokens attending to reasoning tokens and tracking Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) that reflect the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflection cues; (3) mechanistic interventions via activation patching to perturb reasoning activations and observe effects on answers.

Result: Including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality; answer tokens show strong attention to reasoning tokens; RFHs track the reasoning path, including self-reflective signals; perturbing key reasoning tokens via activation patching reliably alters final answers, indicating a directional information flow from reasoning to answer.

Conclusion: Intermediate reasoning plays a functional role in shaping outputs of LRMs; the findings advance understanding of how reasoning traces influence answer generation; data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeSearch introduces an automated red-teaming framework and a 300-case benchmark to assess and improve safety of LLM-powered search agents; results show high vulnerability to unreliable search results and limited defense effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating LLMs with web search expands access to information but opens new safety threat surface from low-quality results; need scalable, transparent evaluation to guide safer agent development.

Method: Two in-the-wild experiments; develop automated red-teaming framework; construct SafeSearch benchmark with 300 test cases across five risk categories; evaluate three search scaffolds across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source LLM backends.

Result: Substantial vulnerabilities observed; highest ASR 90.5% (GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow). Reminder prompting and common defenses underperform; SafeSearch enables transparent safety assessment; code and test cases released.

Conclusion: The framework and benchmark can promote safer agent development by exposing failure modes and guiding defense improvements; broad evaluation reveals limitations of current mitigation strategies; encourages ongoing safety testing.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

### [811] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable, language-model-based method to measure feature sensitivity in Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features, revealing sensitivity as a distinct quality metric; many features show poor sensitivity, and SAE width deterioration lowers average sensitivity across 7 variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analyses of SAE features rely on activating examples and qualitative interpretation, but do not quantify how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its activating examples. The work introduces a scalable method to assess this sensitivity and to evaluate SAE architectures.

Method: For each SAE feature, use a language model to generate text with the same semantic properties as the feature's activating examples. Test whether the feature activates on these generated texts (without producing natural-language descriptions). Assess sensitivity at the feature level and across 7 SAE variants; include human evaluation confirming resemblance between generated texts and original examples.

Result: Feature sensitivity emerges as a distinct quality metric. Many interpretable features exhibit poor sensitivity. Human evaluation supports that non-activating generated texts resemble the original activating examples. Across 7 SAE variants, average feature sensitivity declines as SAE width increases.

Conclusion: Feature sensitivity should be considered a new dimension for evaluating both individual SAE features and SAE architectures, influencing how we interpret interpretability and guide SAE design.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

### [812] [MedLA: A Logic-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23725)
*Siqi Ma,Jiajie Huang,Bolin Yang,Fan Zhang,Jinlin Wu,Yue Shen,Guohui Fan,Zhu Zhang,Zelin Zang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedLA is a logic-driven multi-agent framework for medical reasoning that uses explicit syllogistic trees and graph-guided dialogue to detect and resolve inconsistencies, achieving stronger performance and scalability across LLM backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent medical reasoning systems rely on fixed roles or shallow prompts, which hinder detection of fine-grained logical contradictions and undermine trust in answers. There is a need for transparent, premise-level reasoning and robust consensus mechanisms.

Method: Each agent constructs a reasoning tree using syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, conclusion). Agents engage in multi-round, graph-guided discussions to compare and refine trees, perform error correction and contradiction resolution, and reach consensus. The framework is demonstrated across MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks and scales across open-source and commercial LLMs.

Result: MedLA outperforms static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. It scales across different LLM backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling trustworthy medical reasoning.

Conclusion: MedLA provides a transparent, scalable paradigm for medical reasoning with premise-level alignment and contradiction resolution, generalizable across models and tasks.

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

*Siyao Song,Cong Ma,Zhihao Cheng,Shiye Lei,Minghao Li,Ying Zeng,Huaixiao Tou,Kai Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAPO introduces Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization to improve exploration and internalize expert knowledge in RL-powered LLM reasoning, achieving ~5-point gains on AIME/AIMO benchmarks over self-exploratory baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle inefficient exploration and sparse rewards in outcome-based RL for LLM reasoning by leveraging adaptive, multi-turn consulting with external experts to enrich training signals and embed expert knowledge into the policy.

Method: Propose EAPO framework enabling adaptive expert consultation during training, integrating multi-turn expert interactions to guide policy decisions and reward shaping; expert guidance is internalized into the policy, improving autonomous reasoning in evaluation.

Result: EAPO outperforms expert-assisted workflows, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines on math reasoning benchmarks, with an average gain of about 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: Adaptive expert consultation during RL training can enhance exploration and internalize expert reasoning, leading to more reliable reasoning trajectories and stronger performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

### [814] [Diagnosing Failure Root Causes in Platform-Orchestrated Agentic Systems: Dataset, Taxonomy, and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23735)
*Xuyan Ma,Xiaofei Xie,Yawen Wang,Junjie Wang,Boyu Wu,Mingyang Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AgentFail, a dataset of 307 failure logs from 10 agentic systems, with fine-grained root-cause annotations, plus a taxonomy and an LLM-based benchmark for automatic root-cause identification. The taxonomy improves identification performance, but accuracy peaks at 33.6%, indicating the task remains challenging; provides guidelines for building more reliable platform-orchestrated agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragility of platform-orchestrated agentic systems and the lack of systematic methods to identify root causes of failures, enabling more reliable design and operation of multi-agent, low-code, template-based platforms.

Method: Construct AgentFail dataset with 307 failure logs annotated with root causes; apply counterfactual reasoning-based repair to improve annotation reliability; develop a taxonomy of failure root causes; analyze cross-platform and domain distributions; build a benchmark using LLMs to automatically identify root causes guided by the taxonomy.

Result: The taxonomy substantially improves automatic root-cause identification, validating its utility, but overall accuracy remains limited (maximum 33.6%), underscoring the difficulty of the task. The dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark collectively provide a foundation for improving reliability of platform-orchestrated agentic systems.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable dataset, a structured taxonomy, and a validation benchmark that can guide future work in making platform-orchestrated agentic systems more robust; highlights the remaining challenge in automating root-cause analysis and offers actionable guidelines for building such systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

*Cong Chen,Kaixiang Ji,Hao Zhong,Muzhi Zhu,Anzhou Li,Guo Gan,Ziyuan Huang,Cheng Zou,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd provides dense process supervision for GUI agents by learning a Process Reward Model from 52k human-annotated interactions and GPT-4o rationales, improving both online RL performance and inference reliability, with generalization to offline tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-sequence GUI tasks suffer from sparse rewards and credit assignment; dense, step-by-step process supervision can guide learning and improve policy evaluation.

Method: Train GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model, on a large 52k interaction dataset with human scores and GPT-4o rationales; use it as a reward provider for online RL (PPO) and as an inference verifier; evaluate on online AndroidWorld benchmark and offline AndroidControl benchmark, comparing to Outcome Reward Model baselines.

Result: Online: 7.7-point improvement in success rate with multi-turn online PPO; verifier: 5.1-point improvement; offline: 2.2-point gain as reward provider and 4.3-point gain as verifier.

Conclusion: High-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents and GUI-Shepherd provides a generalizable, effective solution for both online learning and offline inference.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

*Benjamin Teoh,Ben Glocker,Francesca Toni,Avinash Kori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OCEAN is an interpretable object-centric framework where agent negotiation yields faithful, human-understandable explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy on multi-object visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI in vision often relies on posthoc methods that may not reflect true decision logic. A grounding in human-understandable concepts via object-centric representations and a transparent, multi-agent reasoning process can provide faithful and intuitive explanations.

Method: End-to-end training of OCEAN using object-centric representations and a game-theoretic, multi-agent negotiation to select coherent, discriminative evidence. Evaluated against standard visual classifiers and posthoc tools (GradCAM, LIME) on two diagnostic multi-object datasets, with a user study assessing interpretability and trust.

Result: OCEAN achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art black-box models and demonstrates a faithful, interpretable reasoning process. The user study indicates explanations are more intuitive and trustworthy.

Conclusion: OCEAN provides a faithful, end-to-end, interpretable framework for visual explanations that leverages object-centric representations and agent negotiation, offering advantages over posthoc methods in terms of interpretability and user trust.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

*Cheng Yang,Jiaxuan Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Junchi Yu,Feiwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS reframes reaction condition prediction as evidence-based multi-agent reasoning, delivering explainable, higher-accuracy results in chemical reaction condition recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for explainable, trustworthy AI in high-stakes chemical discovery; existing LLMs lack transparent rationale for reaction conditions.

Method: ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation, with justifications grounded in chemical knowledge and precedents.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows 20–35% gains over domain-specific baselines and 10–15% improvements in Top-1 accuracy over general-purpose LLMs, plus falsifiable rationales.

Conclusion: Proposes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery, enabling human-trustable rationales while improving performance.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New multimodal safety resource (Falcon) and specialized evaluator (FalconEye) for MLLMs; dataset with 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories; FalconEye tuned and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gap in multimodal safety research: LLM safety datasets largely focus on text-only models; visual context in content moderation for MLLMs is underdeveloped and requires targeted datasets and evaluators.

Method: Introduce Falcon dataset (57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories) with explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses, plus explanations for judgments. Develop FalconEye, a safety evaluator fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Evaluate on Falcon-test and two benchmarks (VLGuard, Beavertail-V) showing accuracy gains over baselines.

Result: FalconEye demonstrates reliable detection of harmful content in complex multimodal dialogue and achieves higher overall accuracy than all baselines on Falcon-test, VLGuard, and Beavertail-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: FalconEye offers a practical safety auditing tool for multimodal LLMs; the Falcon dataset fills a critical gap by explicitly addressing visual context in harm evaluation, with potential for broader adoption in MLLM safety research.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Motivation: Improve engagement and learning outcomes by maintaining optimal challenge and reducing frustration; extend adaptive systems to emotionally informed player models and educational settings.

Method: Adaptive puzzle generation using a genetic algorithm to create pathfinding puzzles; online real-time adaptation driven by a player-modeling system that tracks interactions to approximate a target difficulty; pilot study comparing different adaptive difficulty schemes and interpreting user responses.

Result: Pilot study provides initial evidence on effectiveness and user responses, demonstrating feasibility of the approach and offering comparative insights; results are preliminary and establish groundwork rather than definitive conclusions.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for emotionally informed player models, advanced AI adaptivity techniques, and broader educational applications beyond gaming.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support
the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mix-ECom: a new benchmark corpus for evaluating LLM-based e-commerce agents with mixed dialogue types and domain-specific rules; baseline models and a dynamic framework are proposed; current agents struggle due to rule-driven hallucinations; dataset to be released publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in evaluating e-commerce agents by introducing a complex, real-world, privacy-cleared dataset that covers mixed dialogue types, multiple task types, and a substantial set of domain rules, enabling robust benchmarking of LLM agents in e-commerce.

Method: Construct Mix-ECom from real-world customer-service dialogues, post-process to remove user privacy and add chain-of-thought (CoT) processing; annotate with four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented, chit-chat), three task types (pre-sales, logistics, after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules; establish baselines and propose a dynamic benchmarking/framework to improve performance.

Result: Empirical baselines show current e-commerce agents underperform on Mix-ECom due to hallucinations and difficulty handling complex domain rules; the framework aims to guide improvements; dataset will be publicly released.

Conclusion: The Mix-ECom dataset will be publicly available and is intended to drive future research in robust, rule-aware e-commerce LLM agents; highlights the need to mitigate rule-induced hallucinations and to enhance capability across mixed dialogue types.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard is a runtime-verification framework for agentic AI that provides continuous, quantitative probabilistic assurances by online learning an MDP of emergent behavior and verifying properties with probabilistic model checking in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional verification methods struggle with unpredictable, emergent agentic AI. There is a need for probabilistic guarantees about the likelihood of failures within given constraints.

Method: The framework acts as an inspection layer that observes raw I/O, abstracts to formal events corresponding to state transitions, uses online learning to build/update an MDP of emergent behavior, and applies probabilistic model checking to verify quantitative properties in real-time.

Result: Proposes a practical framework (AgentGuard) that enables continuous, real-time probabilistic assurance for agentic AI. The abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: AgentGuard offers a path to real-time, probabilistic guarantees for emergent agentic AI by combining online MDP learning with probabilistic model checking, enabling quantitative risk assessment under constraints.

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Outcome-based rewards can miscalibrate training by rewarding flawed middle steps; gradient coupling can amplify suboptimal actions; a classifier-based separation of good/bad actions mitigates this and improves learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous agents to solve long-horizon tasks despite reward misalignment and gradient interference, by identifying root causes and proposing a remedy.

Method: Propose training the actor to classify actions as good or bad, thereby separating embeddings for good and bad actions to reduce gradient interference; evaluate with extensive experiments.

Result: The approach improves training stability and policy performance by mitigating the reinforcement of flawed actions and reducing gradient coupling.

Conclusion: Flawed actions should be punished during training; gradient coupling explains propagation of suboptimal actions; a classifier-based embedding separation offers a viable remedy for agentic RL.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study uncovers multiple jailbreak-related failure modes in GPT-OSS-20B using the Jailbreak Oracle, showing that adversarial prompts can induce unsafe and unintended behaviors with potential serious consequences, highlighting security risks in open-weight LLMs with CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the security and robustness of open-weight LLMs that support chain-of-thought reasoning and Harmony prompts by systematically probing them under adversarial conditions and identifying exploitable failure modes.

Method: Apply the Jailbreak Oracle evaluation framework to GPT-OSS-20B under a range of adversarial scenarios; identify and categorize failure modes such as quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrödinger's compliance, reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting, and demonstrate how these can be exploited.

Result: Identification of several concrete failure modes and patterns of exploitability; experiments show that these behaviors can be triggered and exploited in GPT-OSS-20B, potentially leading to severe real-world consequences.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs with explicit CoT reasoning and Harmony prompts exhibit notable security vulnerabilities under adversarial testing; findings motivate the need for mitigations, better safety protocols, and robust evaluation tools for such models.

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an
extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior

### [825] [From Neural Networks to Logical Theories: The Correspondence between Fibring Modal Logics and Fibring Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23912)
*Ouns El Harzli,Bernardo Cuenca Grau,Artur d'Avila Garcez,Ian Horrocks,Tarek R. Besold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridges fibring in modal logics with fibring in neural networks by formalizing fibred models and deriving expressiveness results for GNNs, GATs, and Transformers; aims to interpret learned logical theories in neural nets via logical fibring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the previously informal link between fibring neural networks and modal logics, enabling a principled framework for learning and reasoning in neurosymbolic systems and for interpreting neural theories using logical tools.

Method: Propose fibred models compatible with fibred neural networks, establish a formal correspondence between fibring in neural networks and fibring in modal logics, and derive non-uniform expressiveness results for Graph NNs, Graph Attention Networks, and Transformer encoders.

Result: The paper provides a theoretical bridge showing non-uniform logical expressiveness for GNNs, GATs, and Transformer encoders within the fibring framework and formalizes compatibility between fibred neural networks and fibred modal logics.

Conclusion: Long-term goal is to use fibring as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learned by neural networks, using computational-logic tools to interpret neurosymbolic learning and reasoning.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

### [826] [Conditional Advantage Estimation for Reinforcement Learning in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23962)
*Guanxu Chen,Yafu Li,Yuxian Jiang,Chen Qian,Qihan Ren,Jingyi Yang,Yu Cheng,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CANON is a direction-agnostic conditional advantage estimator for RL in LLMs that groups responses by a target metric, uses inter-group comparisons to identify metric-trend contributions, and improves math-reasoning and logic tasks, plus token efficiency when optimizing response length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directional priors in reward shaping (e.g., higher entropy or longer responses) can bias RL and require careful tuning; a method that does not assume the direction of the metric's effect can be more robust.

Method: Regroup sampled responses into two groups based on higher vs lower target metric; analyze inter-group trends to determine which metric direction or trend correlates with better performance; identify the best response within each group; amplify the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction.

Result: Entropy-driven CANON outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks; applying CANON to response length improves token efficiency and yields a better Pareto frontier between performance and cost.

Conclusion: CANON offers a robust, direction-agnostic reward shaping approach for RL in LLMs, reducing reliance on hand-tuned penalties and improving reasoning performance and efficiency; likely generalizable to other metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

*José de la Torre-López,Aurora Ramírez,José Raúl Romero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interpretable, grammar-guided evolutionary ML method (OurModel) for automatic paper relevance classification in literature reviews, combining textual and bibliometric features to achieve accurate results without sacrificing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic literature reviews are time-consuming; automating paper selection with ML can greatly reduce effort, and grammar-guided genetic programming enables integrating diverse features into interpretable rules.

Method: Proposes OurModel, an evolutionary ML approach using grammar-guided genetic programming to evolve rule-based classifiers. A grammar defines the syntax and structure of rules to combine textual information with bibliometric data, producing interpretable models.

Result: Experiments show that accurate classifiers can be generated without compromising interpretability, and the method supports configurable information sources beyond those used by prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Grammar-guided evolutionary ML can effectively automate paper screening in literature reviews, delivering interpretable, accurate classifiers that leverage a wider set of information sources.

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate scientific tool development by integrating domain knowledge with large language models, reducing manual literature review and programming effort, and improving reproducibility.

Method: TusoAI uses a knowledge-tree representation to embed domain knowledge, and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis. It benchmarks its performance against expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents on tasks such as single-cell RNA-seq denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring, guided by a task-specific evaluation function.

Result: TusoAI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse tasks; applied to two open genetics problems, it uncovers novel biology, including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants and target genes; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that agentic AI can accelerate computational method development in science, improve performance, and yield novel biological insights, supported by open-source tooling.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass traditional rule-based and small-model approaches by enabling semantic understanding, natural-language interfaces, autonomous pipelines, and tool-augmented workflows for data analysis, across diverse data types and open-world tasks.

Method: A comprehensive review that (i) articulates five design goals—semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, open-world task support—and (ii) surveys techniques across data modalities (structured, semi-structured, unstructured, heterogeneous) to enable data analysis using LLMs and agents.

Result: Provides a taxonomy and synthesis of methods, identifies remaining challenges (e.g., multimodal integration, reliable tool use, open-world reasoning), and outlines practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis (no empirical results reported).

Conclusion: LLM/Agent-powered data analysis is promising but requires progress on design goals and cross-modal capabilities; overcoming open-world task challenges will be crucial for widespread adoption.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

*Miguel Angel Alvarado Gonzalez,Michelle Bruno Hernandez,Miguel Angel Peñaloza Perez,Bruno Lopez Orozco,Jesus Tadeo Cruz Soto,Sandra Malagon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-run leaderboards are brittle; multiple independent repetitions (≥2, ideally 3) reduce rank inversions and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how many repetitions are needed for robust model comparisons on LLM leaderboards and to assess the stability of rankings under stochastic decoding.

Method: Re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting; apply mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability analyses.

Result: Single-run leaderboards invert 83% of slices relative to the three-run majority; zero sign-flip rate for pairwise significance; modest SE shrinkage (~5% from one to three) with averaging but large ranking gains; two runs remove ~83% of single-run inversions.

Conclusion: Treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use ≥2 repetitions under stochastic decoding; these practices improve robustness and are feasible for small teams, aligning model comparisons with real-world reliability.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-model agentic system, Fathom-DeepResearch, combining Fathom-Search-4B and Fathom-Synthesizer-4B to enable robust, tool-assisted reasoning with structured, citation-dense outputs; achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, evidence-based, tool-integrated reasoning for open-ended information-seeking tasks by grounding searches, controlling tool use, and producing traceable synthesis.

Method: Two specialized models: (1) Fathom-Search-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, leverages live web search and targeted querying. Its training uses DUETQA (5K-sample, multi-agent self-play) for strict web-grounding, RAPO (reward-aware, curriculum-pruned, zero-overhead extension of GRPO) for stable multi-turn RL with verifiable rewards, and a steerable, step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility to control search breadth/depth/horizon. This enables extending tool-calling beyond 20 calls. (2) Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, converts multi-turn search traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports. Evaluation on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES, WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench shows state-of-the-art open-weights performance and strong generalization to HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category on DeepSearch benchmarks with robust generalization across diverse reasoning tasks (HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, MedQA).

Conclusion: The Fathom-DeepResearch system demonstrates effective tool-integrated reasoning with controllable search trajectories and high-quality, citation-rich synthesis, achieving leading performance and generalization while enabling extended tool use when warranted.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the semantic gap between natural language interfaces and complex data warehouses, enabling non-technical users to access data. Improve interpretability, auditability, and reliability in high-stakes environments through transparent decision-making and automated evaluation.

Method: A component-based architecture that supports conversational NL interfaces translating user intents into executable database queries. Incorporates a multi-layered reasoning framework for explainability, automated evaluation for benchmarking and regression detection, a statistical context module to quantify deviations, and BigQuery-based secure data retrieval with domain-specific business rules and human-auditable justifications.

Result: Empirical demonstration in an insurance claims case study showing robust, evaluable, and trustworthy operation. The evaluation framework provides objective performance benchmarks against golden standards and automated detection of regressions, with quantitative evidence supporting conclusions.

Conclusion: The integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework is effective for deploying LLM-powered agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains. It enhances transparency, trust, and reliability, and is scalable to enterprise data warehouses (e.g., BigQuery) for secure data access and auditable decision-making.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs' final answers can conflict with their own reasoning traces due to competing CoT and memory retrieval; a new fine-tuning method FARL suppresses retrieval shortcuts to emphasize reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to diagnose the source of inconsistency and improve robustness of LRM reasoning under noisy cues.

Method: perform controlled experiments with misleading cues during reasoning and corrupted retrieval; assess across models, domains, and fine-tuning methods; introduce FARL combining memory unlearning with reinforcement learning.

Result: both CoT reasoning and retrieval influence answers; their dominance varies with domain, model scale, and fine-tuning; retrieval shortcuts can hijack reward signals, undermining genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: FARL can suppress retrieval shortcuts and foster reasoning-dominant behavior, enhancing generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

### [835] [Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159)
*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Robust Preference Optimization (RPO) introduces an EM-based framework to handle noisy/multi-valued human preferences and generalizes to convert existing alignment losses into robust versions; proven to converge to true noise under a calibrated model; improves four state-of-the-art algorithms and yields gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preferences are pluralistic and annotators can err; standard RLHF assumes homogeneous/noiseless data, which is unrealistic and can misguide models. There is a need for a robust framework that accounts for label noise and varying preferences.

Method: An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to infer posterior probabilities of the correctness of each label, enabling adaptive re-weighting of data points in the training loss. The work also establishes a theoretical link between general preference losses and probabilistic models, turning existing alignment methods into robust counterparts. This yields a meta-framework for robust preference alignment and applies to methods like DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO.

Result: Empirically, RPO enhances performance of four alignment algorithms across models Mistral and Llama 3, with win-rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 (up to 7.0%) and Arena-Hard (up to 5.4%). Theoretically, under perfect calibration, RPO converges to the true dataset noise level.

Conclusion: RPO provides a general, theoretically grounded framework for robust preference alignment that mitigates label noise and annotator disagreement. It can improve existing alignment methods and offers convergence guarantees under calibration, making it a versatile tool for making LLM alignment more reliable.

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

### [836] [Humanline: Online Alignment as Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24207)
*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online on-policy alignment (GRPO/PPO) outperforms offline alignment (DPO) due to alignment with human perception. The authors provide a prospect-theory-based explanation, viewing clipping as a perceptual loss and showing that offline data can be made to mimic online success by incorporating perceptual distortions; this allows effective offline/post-training variants (“humanline”) that match online performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why online vs offline alignment differences exist from a human-centric, perceptual perspective and to explore whether perceptual distortions can bridge the gap, enabling efficient offline/post-training without sacrificing utility.

Method: Theoretical analysis grounded in prospect theory. Shows online sampling better approximates the human-perceived model distribution; interprets PPO/GRPO clipping as perceptual losses; proposes a design pattern to inject perceptual distortions into objectives (creating humanline variants); empirically demonstrates offline, perceptual-mimicking variants can match online performance on verifiable/unverifiable tasks.

Result: Online methods typically outperform offline baselines. However, by incorporating perceptual distortions into training objectives (humanline design), offline/off-policy data can achieve parity with online methods, matching performance on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.

Conclusion: The online/offline dichotomy may be incidental to maximizing human utility. Perceptual-aware training enables effective offline post-training, offering faster, cheaper, and more flexible deployment without sacrificing performance; a concrete pattern for building perceptual losses into alignment objectives is proposed.

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Declarative planning methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative planning incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. There is a need for a framework that offers planning horizons with controlled re-planning overhead.

Method: Introduce Action Chains—sequences of actions bound to sub-goal intentions—as the fundamental planning primitive. Operates in a cyclical process: (1) construct intention-bound action sequences, (2) proactively validate conflicts/feasibility, (3) refine issues via targeted mechanisms, (4) execute validated actions. Proposes efficiency metrics (token consumption, planning time) to evaluate multi-agent collaboration.

Result: ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates to state-of-the-art methods while consuming only 24% of the tokens.

Conclusion: Establishes a new efficiency–effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

### [838] [Learning to Ponder: Adaptive Reasoning in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24238)
*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a backbone-training-free framework that adaptively allocates reasoning depth at test time via a tiny controller and latent steering, improving compute-accuracy tradeoffs on GSM8K and MATH500 without changing the LLM backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To cure the inefficiency of uniform-depth approaches (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting) by enabling instance-specific compute allocation based on problem difficulty.

Method: A <1M-param controller sits on the frozen backbone, observes hidden states, and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a pre-computed steering vector to the frozen representations, scaled by a tunable factor. It extracts latent steering vectors linked to deeper reasoning outputs and re-applies them with a scaling factor. Training uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum to regulate compute; no backbone weights are updated; analyses show interpretable steering directions and compute allocation correlating with difficulty.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder delivers a better compute-accuracy frontier, achieving lower FLOPs with better-matched accuracy and outperforming early-exit baselines; analyses reveal interpretable steering directions and that computed depth correlates with problem difficulty.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder enables calibrated, instance-adaptive reasoning compute without backbone finetuning, yielding efficient and interpretable compute allocation aligned with input difficulty.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

### [839] [Model Merging Scaling Laws in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24244)
*Yuanyi Wang,Yanggan Gu,Yiming Zhang,Qi Zhou,Zhaoyi Yan,Congkai Xie,Xinyao Wang,Jianbo Yuan,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A compact, cross-domain scaling law links model size and the number of experts in language-model merging, showing a size-dependent floor that falls with base capacity and a diminishing-tail with respect to experts, enabling predictive planning and budget trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a quantitative rule for returns when merging experts or scaling model size, addressing the lack of predictive guidance in mixture-of-experts merging.

Method: Empirical analysis across architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE) in-domain and cross-domain. The authors identify a size-dependent floor and a diminishing tail that follows a power law, and they propose a simple theory explaining why gains scale roughly as 1/k and linking floor and tail to base-model properties and domain diversity.

Result: The proposed law fits measured curves across diverse settings, showing most gains early and decreasing variability as more experts are added. Gains scale roughly as 1/k and the floor decreases with base capacity; the tail exhibits diminishing returns with the number of experts. The law supports predictive planning for the number of experts needed to reach a target loss and for when to stop adding experts; it also suggests a scalable principle for distributed generative AI by composing specialists.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable, predictive framework for language-model merging, enabling efficient budgeting between scaling the base model and adding experts, and presenting a path toward AGI-level systems through distributed specialization.

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

### [840] [SpecExit: Accelerating Large Reasoning Model via Speculative Exit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24248)
*Rubing Yang,Huajun Bai,Song Liu,Guanghua Yu,Runzhi Fan,Yanbin Dang,Jiejing Zhang,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpecExit reduces generation length and latency by predicting exit signals and future tokens from a lightweight draft model, avoiding probing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from overthinking (long outputs, high latency). Early-exit methods with probing overhead limit latency gains and generalizability. The approach aims to exploit hidden states to enable efficient early-exits without probing overhead.

Method: Train/use a lightweight draft model to predict both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from hidden states, eliminating probing overhead and leveraging speculative decoding concepts.

Result: Average generation length shortened by 66%, end-to-end latency reduced by 2.5x compared to the speculative decoding baseline, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Hidden-state signals can effectively support early exits and efficient reasoning, suggesting broader use of hidden states for reducing computation in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

### [841] [Interactive Program Synthesis for Modeling Collaborative Physical Activities from Narrated Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24250)
*Edward Kim,Daniel He,Jorge Chao,Wiktor Rajca,Mohammed Amin,Nishant Malpani,Ruta Desai,Antti Oulasvirta,Bjoern Hartmann,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A program-synthesis approach enables learning collaborative physical tasks from narrated demonstrations; editable programs let users inspect, refine, and correct system behavior without coding; a small user study shows substantial success and ease of correction, though challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the ambiguity and dynamism of team-based physical tasks by offering interpretable, editable representations that users can inspect and correct, improving collaboration between humans and systems.

Method: Represent system behavior as editable programs; teach via narrated demonstrations (paired actions + natural language) as a unified teaching channel for learning, inspection, and correction; conduct a within-subjects study with 20 participants teaching multiplayer soccer tactics.

Result: 70% of participants refined the learned programs to match their intent; 90% found it easy to correct the programs; revealed challenges specific to program-as-model representation and teaching collaboration.

Conclusion: Framing collaborative physical task learning as program synthesis with narrated demonstrations is promising for interpretability and corrigibility, but requires addressing domain-specific representation and teaching challenges; the paper discusses mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

### [842] [Rethinking and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24260)
*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM-based graph reasoning benchmarks, introduces a tougher GraphAlgorithm benchmark, and presents Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC) as a strong baseline that first designs graph algorithms and then implements them, achieving near-perfect scores on existing benchmarks and strong gains on GraphAlgorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches to graph reasoning underperform due to misaligned focus (replicating graph algorithms) and weak benchmarks. There is a need to reevaluate evaluation benchmarks and guidance for model design to truly test reasoning capabilities.

Method: Create a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark with 239 graph problems and 3,041 test instances from 4 platforms. Propose Simple-RTC: guide LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to implement them. Evaluate on both existing benchmarks and GraphAlgorithm.

Result: Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and prior methods on GraphAlgorithm.

Conclusion: The Simple-RTC baseline sets a strong standard for LLMs in graph reasoning and suggests future research should center on reasoning-forward design and robust benchmarks rather than solely empirical improvements on weak baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

### [843] [Risk-Sensitive RL for Alleviating Exploration Dilemmas in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24261)
*Yuhua Jiang,Jiawei Huang,Yufeng Yuan,Xin Mao,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A risk-sensitive RL approach (RS-GRPO) improves pass@k in LLM-based reasoning by using a risk-seeking objective that blends mean and max rewards, enabling deeper exploration beyond the sharp initial policies of pre-trained LLMs. Demonstrated across six mathematical benchmarks and five LLMs, with maintained or improved pass@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based reward shaping for LLMs (RLVR) often suffers from an exploration dilemma: highly peaked initial policies limit exploration to a narrow set of solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but harming solution diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). There is a need to discover new reasoning strategies rather than merely distilling existing capabilities.

Method: Introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework using a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards. Develop the RS-GRPO algorithm, a simple-to-implement extension requiring only minor code changes, designed to amplify learning from challenging prompts and encourage exploration beyond the initial policy peak.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs, while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Conclusion: RS-GRPO provides deeper exploration and greater solution diversity in RL-based LLM training, addressing the exploration dilemma of RLVR with minimal implementation burden and potential applicability to other reasoning tasks beyond mathematics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

*Junjie Luo,Yihong Guo,Anqi Liu,Ritu Agarwal,Gordon,Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agent-based, DIKW-driven framework (PAME-AI) for creating and optimizing patient messages; in two large-stage experiments, the best message achieved 68.76% engagement versus a 61.27% baseline, a 12.2% relative improvement in click-through rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mobile message design struggles with exploring a high-dimensional design space, limiting scalable optimization of health messaging. A structured, scalable approach is needed to improve engagement and, potentially, health-related behaviors.

Method: DIKW-based architecture with specialized AI agents that iteratively transform raw experimental data into actionable message design strategies. Two-stage experiments with large samples (Stage 1: 444,691 encounters; Stage 2: 74,908). Parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous learning enable high-throughput optimization of messages.

Result: Best-generated message achieved 68.76% engagement, up from 61.27% baseline; 12.2% relative improvement in click-through rates. Demonstrates scalability and effectiveness of agentic design for messaging.

Conclusion: Agentic AI within a DIKW framework offers a scalable path for optimizing healthcare messaging at large scale; effective in improving engagement, with potential for ongoing learning and refinement. Further work needed to assess impact on health outcomes and generalizability across settings.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

*Zihao Zhu,Xinyu Wu,Gehan Hu,Siwei Lyu,Ke Xu,Baoyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvChain introduces adversarial CoT tuning to teach Large Reasoning Models dynamic self-correction, mitigating the snowball effect in chain-of-thought and improving safety with minimal impact on reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety challenges in multi-step reasoning (CoT) extend beyond standard alignment. The snowball effect causes minor deviations to amplify, leading to harmful compliance or excessive refusals. Current safety CoT tuning trains on ideal reasoning, failing to teach self-correction.

Method: Construct an adversarial CoT dataset featuring Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples. Train models to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions, enabling dynamic self-correction during reasoning (AdvChain).

Result: AdvChain enhances robustness against jailbreaks and CoT hijacking, reduces over-refusal on benign prompts, and achieves a better safety-utility balance without hurting reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AdvChain opens a new path for robust, reliable reasoning in LRMs by embedding self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning, potentially applicable to broader safety and reliability challenges.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: G-reasoner presents a unified graph-and-language foundation to reason over diverse graph-structured knowledge by introducing QuadGraph and a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that integrates with LLMs; demonstrates scalability and superior performance across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have static, incomplete knowledge; existing RAG and graph-augmented methods struggle with knowledge fragmentation, poor graph reasoning, scalability; need a unified, scalable framework to jointly model graph topology and textual semantics to improve reasoning.

Method: Introduce QuadGraph four-layer abstraction to unify heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph; develop a 34M-parameter GFM that encodes topology and textual semantics; integrate GFM with LLMs for improved reasoning; implement mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing to scale; evaluate on six benchmarks.

Result: G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improves LLM reasoning, and offers strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: A unified QuadGraph + GFM framework enables scalable, effective reasoning over graph-structured knowledge when combined with LLMs, with broad generalization across graphs and practical efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

TL;DR: Introduces SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier to enhance verification of LLMs in scientific reasoning via a cross-disciplinary benchmark and a reasoning-augmented verifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verification studies in scientific domains lack systematic evaluation standards, narrow disciplinary coverage, and reliance on heavy rule/prompt engineering, hindering reliability and cross-domain generalization.

Method: Data side: build SCI-VerifyBench across mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA using real LLM responses, domain-specific equivalence transformations, and expert annotations. Model side: develop SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier, trained post-hoc to improve logical reasoning and equivalence judgment while delivering concise outputs.

Result: SCI-Verifier exhibits strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgments; SCI-VerifyBench enables rigorous, cross-disciplinary evaluation; together they offer a principled framework for evaluating and improving scientific verification in LLMs.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier jointly provide a principled framework for systematic evaluation and practical improvement of LLM reliability in scientific domains.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

*Hongjun Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Yuhui Wang,Yitao Long,Zeyu Lai,Lequan Yu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedMMV introduces a controllable, multi-agent framework for clinical reasoning in multimodal LLMs, stabilizing reasoning, reducing hallucinations via evidence graphs and detectors, and achieving improved accuracy and reliability on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs exhibit instability in early evidence interpretation that leads to hallucinations and globally inconsistent conclusions in clinical reasoning; there is a need for auditable, low-stochasticity reasoning processes in high-stakes medical AI.

Method: A four-part approach: (1) diversified short rollouts to stabilize reasoning, (2) an evidence graph to ground intermediate steps, supervised by a Hallucination Detector, (3) a Combined Uncertainty scorer to aggregate candidate reasoning paths, and (4) a controllable, multi-agent framework that orchestrates these components.

Result: On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV yields up to 12.7% accuracy improvement and demonstrates superior reliability; blind physician evaluations show substantially increased reasoning truthfulness without sacrificing informational content.

Conclusion: A verifiable, multi-agent process that controls instability and hallucination provides a robust path toward deploying trustworthy AI in high-stakes clinical decision support.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision

Motivation: Regulatory emphasis on trustworthy AI (e.g., AI Act) requires measuring input data quality and estimating output bias for high-risk AI systems. Traditional distance measures (MMD, Wasserstein-1) are challenged by scalability and computability.

Method: Introduce two new bias-detection methods: maximum subgroup discrepancy (MSD) and subsampled ℓ∞ distances, packaged as the humancompatible.detect toolkit with an easy-to-use API and examples.

Result: Presentation of a practical toolkit and the two novel bias-detection methods; documentation and examples are provided; released under Apache License 2.0.

Conclusion: The work contributes a practical, scalable bias-detection toolkit addressing regulatory needs, enabling accessible bias measurement in high-risk AI systems.

Abstract: There is a strong recent emphasis on trustworthy AI. In particular,
international regulations, such as the AI Act, demand that AI practitioners
measure data quality on the input and estimate bias on the output of high-risk
AI systems. However, there are many challenges involved, including scalability
(MMD) and computability (Wasserstein-1) issues of traditional methods for
estimating distances on measure spaces. Here, we present
humancompatible.detect, a toolkit for bias detection that addresses these
challenges. It incorporates two newly developed methods to detect and evaluate
bias: maximum subgroup discrepancy (MSD) and subsampled $\ell_\infty$
distances. It has an easy-to-use API documented with multiple examples.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fin-Solution 2.0 introduces Fin-Vault dataset and Fin-Ally model to produce professional, commonsense-augmented, multi-turn financial guidance, optimized via DPO, addressing unprofessional model remarks in FinTech chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unprofessional or context-inappropriate responses from large-scale fine-tuning in fintech chatbots; scarcity of domain-specific dialogue data; need for personalized financial guidance and human-like interactions.

Method: Create Fin-Vault 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues; develop Fin-Ally integrating COMET-BART-level commonsense context, politeness, human-like conversational dynamics; apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align responses; dataset and code release.

Result: Improved generation of refined, textually precise, professionally grounded financial guidance; demonstration of advantages of commonsense context; more human-aligned responses; dataset and code available.

Conclusion: Fin-Ally is presented as a next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector with promising potential, though the moderate dataset size and need for broader evaluation highlight areas for future work, including generalization, safety, and privacy considerations.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

### [852] [From Static to Dynamic: Adaptive Monte Carlo Search for Mathematical Process Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24351)
*Jie Ma,Shihao Qi,Rui Xing,Ziang Yin,Bifan Wei,Jun Liu,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) for data generation in Process Reward Models (PRMs) improves efficiency and generalization by adaptive sampling and temporal exploration-exploitation in path expansion; results on math reasoning benchmarks with a 200K dataset (MathSearch-200K).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRM data generation relies on fixed-budget sampling, which is inefficient and inflexible in exploring the reasoning space. There is a need for adaptive, dynamic search to improve data quality and training efficacy for LLMs on mathematical reasoning.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) that adaptively refines node-value estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain steps and fewer to easier ones, and uses a temporally adaptive policy for path expansion from exploration to exploitation. Construct MathSearch-200K dataset and train PRMs; evaluate on four math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: AMCS-based models achieve strong performance, e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS reaches up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500 with GLM-4-9B, outperforming baselines. A 7B model supervised by AMCS-based PRM surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision. Robust gains on out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: AMCS effectively enhances data generation quality and PRM training, improving accuracy and generalization in mathematical reasoning tasks; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

### [853] [Plan before Solving: Problem-Aware Strategy Routing for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24377)
*Shihao Qi,Jie Ma,Ziang Yin,Lingling Zhang,Jian Zhang,Jun Liu,Feng Tian,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM decouples mathematical reasoning into instance-specific planning and targeted execution, using a MathStrat dataset and a Strategy Adapter to route LLMs across single, dual, or multi-strategy reasoning, improving performance and efficiency across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single fixed reasoning strategies cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. An adaptive, instance-level planning approach is needed to select appropriate strategies per problem.

Method: Introduce PRISM framework with two stages: strategy planning and targeted execution. Create MathStrat dataset capturing correctness, process quality, and computational cost for each problem-strategy pair. Train a lightweight Strategy Adapter to estimate confidence over four strategies. At inference, use an adaptive routing policy to choose: (i) single-strategy for high-confidence predictions, (ii) dual-strategy verification for competitive cases, or (iii) multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms single strategies and ensemble baselines, with improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and various base models. The adaptive routing approach shows strong benefits across model architectures.

Conclusion: Decoupling reasoning into strategy planning and adaptive execution enables dynamic, problem-specific selection among reasoning strategies, yielding improvements in accuracy and efficiency. The approach is validated across multiple benchmarks and model types, and the authors release their code.

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

*Yichi Zhang,Yue Ding,Jingwen Yang,Tianwei Luo,Dongbai Li,Ranjie Duan,Qiang Liu,Hang Su,Yinpeng Dong,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IPO aligns the safety of reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, reducing harmful content by >30% while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods ignore the safety of the reasoning process; harmful CoT can persist and be exploited; need to ensure safe reasoning to improve trust and safety.

Method: Propose Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO): leverage insights that safe reasoning is driven by a few triggers; substitute compliance steps with safety triggers; construct preference-learning data pairs with strong safety signals; use process supervision to steer unsafe trajectories toward safe traces.

Result: Benchmarks on jailbreak/adversarial safety show IPO achieves >30% relative reduction in harmfulness compared with SFT/RL baselines; preserves performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning the reasoning process is crucial; IPO offers a practical pathway to safer LLMs by focusing on safety triggers and strong-signal preference learning.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising complexity of industrial systems and the need for predictive maintenance to prevent downtime and safety-critical failures; IoT, AI, and real-time analytics enable real-time interventions; DT is a central enabling technology, but gaps remain in understanding its evolution, architecture, and AI-enabled self-learning capabilities.

Method: Retrospective temporal analysis of the DT evolution in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering; development of a layered DT architecture; creation of a taxonomy covering applications, middleware, and AI algorithms; synthesis of insights and discussion of future research directions.

Result: Proposes a layered DT architecture and a taxonomy for technology-enabled industrial engineering applications, systems, middleware, and AI algorithms; provides insights aimed at realizing a trustworthy and efficient smart DT ecosystem; identifies future research directions for DT in predictive maintenance.

Conclusion: Future research should advance trustworthy, efficient, AI-enabled DTs for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering, addressing architectural, middleware, and algorithmic aspects and bridging gaps toward self-learning capabilities.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

*Haotian Zhang,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Likang Xiao,Yanwei Ren,Quan Chen,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ContextPRM improves cross-domain generalization of process reward models by emphasizing domain-agnostic logical flow, achieving 6.5% average accuracy gains over majority voting in MMLU-Pro across nine non-mathematical domains, and outperforming VersaPRM and other math-focused PRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs currently excel in math but struggle to generalize to other domains due to domain-specific training data and knowledge-based learning patterns; there is a need to shift learning objectives toward domain-agnostic logical flow and contextual coherence in chain-of-thought (CoT).

Method: Introduce a novel data annotation and training framework that centers on contextual coherence between CoT steps; apply weighted majority voting across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro; compare cross-domain performance with math-focused PRMs like VersaPRM.

Result: ContextPRM yields a 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the majority voting baseline in nine non-mathematical domains of MMLU-Pro; it significantly outperforms VersaPRM by 2.2% and other math-focused PRMs by 0.5%, indicating robust cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: Modeling domain-agnostic logical flow via CoT coherence can substantially improve cross-domain generalization of PRMs, enabling consistent performance across mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid Constraint Acquisition framework that combines passive learning, interactive refinement with probabilistic confidence scores (seeded by ML priors), subset exploration to recover valid substructures, and final active learning to combat over-fitting and reduce query load, achieving high model coverage under data-limited conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is labor-intensive, and existing CA approaches struggle: passive methods over-fit with scarce data, while pure active methods are query-heavy. A robust, data-efficient CA framework is needed to produce accurate models without excessive querying.

Method: 1) Passive learning to generate initial candidate constraints. 2) Query-driven interactive refinement using probabilistic confidence scores (from ML priors) to identify over-fitted constraints. 3) Specialized subset exploration to recover valid substructures from rejected candidates. 4) Final active learning phase to ensure model completeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show the interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model coverage and accuracy with limited examples, while keeping query complexity manageable.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid CA framework advances robust, practical constraint acquisition for data-limited scenarios by effectively mitigating over-fitting and balancing learning efficiency with query cost.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-task learning and inference-time dynamic models fix architecture during training, limiting adaptability for new tasks. The paper aims to enable structural plasticity to improve performance and continual learning in time-series forecasting.

Method: Introduce NMT-Net that triggers network adaptation when a new task arrives, uses similarity-based task identification, trains selective candidate ANN heads, evaluates them, and integrates the best-performing components into the main model.

Result: On three real-world Kaggle demand forecasting datasets, NMT-Net achieves lower RMSE and lower standard deviation than baselines and state-of-the-art MTL methods, showing superior performance and consistency.

Conclusion: NMT-Net offers a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time-series prediction; provides code on GitHub; implies potential for broader adoption in time-series forecasting and dynamic networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoPH co-evolves prompts and heuristics with an island-migration, elitist-selection framework to diversify automatic heuristic design via LLMs, achieving lowest relative error on TSP and Bin Packing compared to optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic design of heuristics with LLMs can reduce manual engineering, but current methods risk stagnation in local optima. A mechanism to maintain diversity and leverage feedback is needed.

Method: Introduce EvoPH: Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics. It uses an island migration model with elites selection to maintain multiple diverse heuristic populations. Prompts are co-evolved with heuristics and guided by performance feedback (reflective loop). Applied to Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem, using LLMs as mutation operators and prompt design adjustments.

Result: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions on both TSP and Bin Packing datasets, outperforming baselines and demonstrating effectiveness of co-evolving prompts with heuristics for automatic algorithm design.

Conclusion: Co-evolution of prompts and heuristics via an island-migration, elite-selection framework effectively mitigates stagnation and improves automatic algorithm design with LLMs for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior world models in predicting complex object interactions, enable data-efficient learning from unlabeled videos, and pursue safe, rapid learning for robotics and intelligent agents.

Method: Develop a scalable, transformer-based world model with a shortcut forcing objective that enables real-time interactive inference; train to predict object interactions and game mechanics; learn general action conditioning from limited data; perform reinforcement learning inside imagination and evaluate on Minecraft, including an offline-data challenge.

Result: The world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous models by a large margin; real-time inference on a single GPU; learns general action conditioning from small data; Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data without environment interaction.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, advancing world-model-based reinforcement learning and moving toward intelligent agents capable of learning from offline data and safe exploration, with potential impact on robotics and other data-scarce domains.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Andrea Rafanelli,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette ten Teije,Frank van Harmelen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop teaching framework enabling incremental learning from few demonstrations using domain knowledge and strategic example selection, applied to ingredient substitution; achieves 50% task performance with 100 examples versus 50k in full data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn concepts from few examples; AI struggles with subjective tasks with scarce data; need for intuitive teaching that supports incremental learning and sample efficiency.

Method: Proposes a human-agent teaching architecture where the agent learns incrementally from single demonstrations, broadens task understanding with domain knowledge, uses a learning method for efficient few-shot learning, and optimizes human-selected representative, non-redundant examples; applies to ingredient substitution using Recipe1MSubs dataset.

Result: Agent reaches about half of its task performance after 100 examples, compared with 50k examples for full training; strategic order of examples and leveraging external symbolic knowledge improve generalization.

Conclusion: Combining human demonstrations, domain knowledge, and smart example sequencing yields data-efficient learning for subjective tasks; useful for human-in-the-loop AI applications.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

### [864] [Successful Misunderstandings: Learning to Coordinate Without Being Understood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24660)
*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Anil Yaman,Frank van Harmelen,Erman Acar,Annette ten Teije*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how signaling and coordination emerge when agents observe only signals and rewards, revealing that misinterpretations can persist. It shows that having at least three interacting agents is necessary to guarantee the emergence of shared interpretations and robust coordination with new partners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the common assumption that successful communication implies mutual understanding, especially in heterogeneous populations (e.g., humans and artificial agents) where agents have non-overlapping observations and interpretations.

Method: A signaling game where agents develop and refine a vocabulary using only the communication signal and the interaction reward, across populations that perceive the environment differently. The study analyzes convergence to coordination, occurrences of successful misunderstandings, and the impact of interaction structure (notably the number of agents) on shared interpretation.

Result: Populations converge to optimal coordination but can exhibit successful misunderstandings where interpretations are misaligned yet coordination appears to succeed. Such misunderstandings impede coordination with new partners. When at least three agents interact, a compensating mechanism emerges that yields shared interpretations, overcoming the lack of shared observations.

Conclusion: Robust emergence of shared interpretations requires triadic interactions; three-agent dynamics help compensate for non-shared observations, facilitating stable coordination across partners. This has implications for designing multi-agent systems and human-AI collaborations where observers differ.

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

### [865] [On the Self-awareness of Large Reasoning Models' Capability Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24711)
*Qingjie Zhang,Yujia Fu,Yang Wang,Liu Yan,Tao Wei,Ke Xu,Minlie Huang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs show boundary-aware behavior; monitor their reasoning process and internal states to avoid unproductive reasoning, cutting token usage by up to 62.7–93.6% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misbehavior and inefficiency of large reasoning models on hard problems, by understanding and exploiting their capability boundaries and self-awareness.

Method: For black-box models: analyze reasoning traces to identify boundary signals; solvable problems exhibit accelerating confidence while unsolvable ones show converging uncertainty. For white-box models: last-token hidden states carry boundary information, with solvable/unsolvable problems linearly separable even before reasoning; propose two strategies—reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring.

Result: Boundary-aware strategies improve reliability and efficiency, significantly reducing token usage (62.7%–93.6%) while preserving or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: LRMs may possess self-awareness of their capability boundaries; simple monitoring strategies can prevent unproductive reasoning and enable more reliable and efficient challenge-solving.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

*Yueming Sun,Long Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-transformer framework (SFTG) for EEG decoding combines spatial-temporal graph encoding with subject-specific archetype contrastive learning to improve performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals are high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean, causing significant intra-subject variability and challenging visual decoding. A robust representation that captures spatial connectivity and temporal dynamics is needed.

Method: Introduce EEG Graph Transformer (EGT) to encode spatial brain connectivity and temporal dynamics; apply Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC) to learn subject-specific EEG graph archetypes, mitigating intra-subject variability; evaluate in subject-dependent and subject-independent settings on the Things-EEG dataset.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods, demonstrating improved feature consistency and class separability, and better generalization due to the contrastive objective and graph-based architecture.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives yields more generalizable, robust EEG-based brain decoding representations and highlights the promise of spatial-functional awareness in neural decoding.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

### [867] [From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765)
*Yunyao Zhang,Xinglang Zhang,Junxi Sheng,Wenbing Li,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang,Zikai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semiotic-square-guided, multi-perspective first-order logic framework (LogicAgent) with a three-valued semantics, paired with the RepublicQA benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong generalization to other logical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM logical reasoning methods largely ignore the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, leading to struggles with abstract propositions, ambiguity, and conflicting stances commonly appearing in human reasoning.

Method: LogicAgent uses semiotic-square-guided multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic, incorporates existential import checks with a three-valued (True/False/Uncertain) decision scheme to handle boundary cases, and introduces RepublicQA—a semantically rich benchmark grounded in philosophical concepts with abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary/contradictory relations.

Result: LogicAgent achieves a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines on RepublicQA and generalizes to mainstream benchmarks ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA with an additional 7.05% average gain.

Conclusion: Semiotic-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning effectively boosts LLM logical performance; RepublicQA provides a richly diverse benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning; the approach generalizes across multiple logical benchmarks.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

### [868] [TimeOmni-1: Incentivizing Complex Reasoning with Time Series in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24803)
*Tong Guan,Zijie Meng,Dianqi Li,Shiyu Wang,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Qingsong Wen,Zuozhu Liu,Sabato Marco Siniscalchi,Ming Jin,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive suite for time series reasoning (TSR-Suite) plus a unified model (TimeOmni-1) that enhances perception, extrapolation, and decision-making, achieving better causality discovery and event-aware forecasting than GPT-4.1 on held tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of genuine time-series reasoning tasks and high-quality data; existing multimodal time series datasets focus on surface alignment and question answering.

Method: Introduces TSR-Suite with 23k samples (2.3k human-curated) and four atomic tasks spanning perception, extrapolation, and decision-making; provides data pipeline and training for TSRMs; presents TimeOmni-1, trained in multiple stages with task mixtures, novel rewards, and tailored optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 shows strong out-of-distribution generalization across tasks and a high rate of valid responses; causality discovery accuracy improves to 64.0% from 35.9% with GPT-4.1; event-aware forecasting valid response rate exceeds GPT-4.1 by over 6%.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite offers a comprehensive benchmark and workflow for developing and evaluating time series reasoning models; TimeOmni-1 demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of unified, multi-task TSRMs, paving the way for more robust time-series reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

### [869] [Query Circuits: Explaining How Language Models Answer User Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24808)
*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intro of query circuits for input-specific explanations of language models, plus Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) and sampling-based sparsification. Demonstrates extremely sparse circuits can recover substantial performance on single queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations focus on global capability circuits and do not explain why a model outputs a specific answer for a given input; there is a need for faithful, local explanations of input-to-output behavior.

Method: Define and identify query circuits inside the model that trace information flow from a specific input to its output. Introduce Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) as a robust evaluation metric. Develop sampling-based methods to discover sparse yet faithful circuits.

Result: Experiments on IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and ARC show extremely sparse query circuits exist; for example, a circuit using only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on MMLU questions for individual queries.

Conclusion: Query circuits enable faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs, complementing global capability circuits.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

*Zhen Bi,Zhenlin Hu,Jinnan Yang,Mingyang Chen,Cheng Deng,Yida Xue,Zeyu Yang,Qing Shen,Zhenfang Liu,Kang Zhao,Ningyu Zhang,Jungang Lou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) to quantify latent reasoning in training data and a re-cognizing optimization to boost LLM reasoning capacity by data rather than scale, improving performance and generalization, also validated under RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' reasoning performance is shaped by both training data potential and model cognitive capacity. Existing data-centric work mainly focuses on data formats and scale, neglecting implicit logical reasoning content in samples. This work proposes a measurable latent reasoning metric (DRI) and a data-centric optimization to unlock the data's reasoning potential.

Method: Define DRI to decompose and quantify the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by parsing their logical structures and aggregating these signals. Use DRI to analyze how well current LLMs utilize reasoning signals and identify gaps. Propose a re-cognizing optimization strategy that re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary without increasing data volume. Validate under standard training and reinforcement learning settings.

Result: Empirical results show significant performance and generalization gains over traditional data-centric strategies. The approach outperforms volume-based or superficial-format improvements. Reinforcement learning experiments further validate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data enhances cognitive potential of LLMs.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in data, rather than merely increasing data size or altering formats, is essential to realizing the full cognitive potential of LLMs. The data's latent logical structure and its alignment with model capacity are critical factors for robust reasoning and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A coevolutionary multi-agent system (PhysicsMinions) tackles Physics Olympiad problems via three synergistic studios (Visual, Logic, Review) to achieve strong generalization, historic open-source breakthroughs, and near-human expert performance on the HiPhO benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics Olympiads require advanced multimodal reasoning and precise solution verification; current AI approaches are mostly single-model and underperform at gold-medal level, especially for open-source models.

Method: PhysicsMinions deploys three interdependent studios: Visual Studio for diagram interpretation, Logic Studio for solution derivation, and Review Studio for dual-stage verification. It uses a coevolutionary loop where feedback from the Review Studio guides the Logic Studio iteratively toward the ground truth, enabling self-correction and convergence.

Result: On the HiPhO benchmark across 7 recent Olympiads, PhysicsMinions achieves: (i) strong generalization—consistent improvements for both open-source and closed-source models across sizes; (ii) historic breakthroughs—open-source medals rise from 1–2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, including the first open-source gold in the latest IPhO (average-score metric); (iii) scaling to human experts—Pass@32 reaches 26.8/30 (rank 4th of 406 contestants, top-4) while the top single-model score is 22.7 (rank 22nd).

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions provides a generalizable, multi-agent framework for high-level problem solving at Olympiad scale, with potential applicability beyond physics to other disciplines.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

TL;DR: A systematic review of 270 studies yields a three-domain computational taxonomy of the social science of LLMs, offering a reproducible map to organize evidence and guide future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in the social science of AI and clarify how LLMs evoke mind attributions, mediate multi-agent interactions, and reshape human activity and institutions, while standardizing evidentiary practices.

Method: Systematic review of 270 studies, employing text embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy.

Result: Three domains emerge: LLM as Social Minds; LLM Societies; LLM-Human Interactions. The taxonomy provides a reproducible map, clarifies evidentiary standards across analysis levels, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress; it also engages with challenges like test leakage and surface cues.

Conclusion: The taxonomy advances synthesis in a fragmented field, enabling more cohesive progress in the social science of AI by standardizing evidentiary expectations and guiding future research across domains.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RealUnify benchmarks bidirectional synergy between understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, using two axes of evaluation and a dual end-to-end plus diagnostic protocol; results show current unified models lack sufficient synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that existing benchmarks evaluate understanding and generation in isolation and do not reveal whether architectural unification enables true synergy between capabilities.

Method: RealUnify comprises 1,000 human-annotated instances across 10 categories and 32 subtasks, organized into two axes: 1) Understanding Enhances Generation (reasoning to guide image generation) and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding (mental simulation to solve reasoning tasks). It employs a dual-evaluation protocol: end-to-end assessment plus stepwise diagnostic evaluation that decomposes tasks into separate understanding and generation phases. The study evaluates 12 unified models and 6 specialized baselines.

Result: Current unified models struggle to achieve effective synergy; architectural unification alone is insufficient. The findings indicate the need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock unified modeling potential.

Conclusion: Architectural unification alone does not guarantee synergistic capabilities; to realize true bidirectional synergy between understanding and generation, new training approaches and inductive biases are required.

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID uses neural embeddings to recover latent psychometric dimensions from survey items, showing that large-language-model embeddings can replicate PVQ-RR structure without fine-tuning, with competitive validity and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable, cost-effective psychometric measurement by deriving latent dimensions from item embeddings, and overcome the challenge of negative correlations and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Process neural embeddings of survey items through the SQuID framework, compare multiple embedding models, and evaluate against human rater judgments on PVQ-RR using variance explained in dimension-dimension similarities and multidimensional scaling/factor congruence analyses.

Result: Embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in dimension–dimension similarities relative to human data; MD Scaling configurations show fair factor congruence and align with theory, indicating embeddings can replicate established psychometric structures.

Conclusion: Semantic embeddings via SQuID offer a cost-effective, scalable complement to traditional psychometrics that can reproduce core latent structures without extensive domain-specific tuning.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

*Bahti Zakirov,Gašper Tkačik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Bayesian meta-learning framework converts normative theory predictions into probabilistic models using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, enabling automatic theory-data integration and model selection in neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the laborious and often impractical task of quantitatively arbitraing between competing normative theories and using them as inductive biases to improve data-driven fits in biology. The work aims to provide an automated, scalable framework that safely injects theory structure into data analysis and validation.

Method: Meta-learn a kernel on synthetic data generated by a normative theory using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes. Build a Theory-Informed Kernel that encapsulates the theory's predictions and uncertainties. Apply to early visual system with efficient coding as normative theory, fitting to ex vivo mouse retinal ganglion cell data and using exact Bayesian model selection to assess theory-match.

Result: The framework yields improved response prediction accuracy over conventional data-driven baselines, with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretable representations. Exact Bayesian model selection indicates the kernel accurately infers the degree of theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.

Conclusion: A general, scalable, and automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in neuroscience and beyond, enabling better predictions, uncertainty quantification, and principled theory validation.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

*Huihao Jing,Wenbin Hu,Hongyu Luo,Jianhui Yang,Wei Fan,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASLegalBench is a GDPR-based benchmark for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems in legal tasks, highlighting how MAS advantages like task decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training can be leveraged, using role-based agents and deductive reasoning across multiple LLMs, with insights on model strengths and gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of evaluation tools tailored to multi-agent systems (MAS) in the legal domain. Existing legal benchmarks focus on single-agent LLMs and do not adequately assess MAS-specific benefits such as task decomposition, specialization, and flexible training. A dedicated MAS-specific benchmark is needed to guide development and reveal strengths, limitations, and improvement opportunities for MAS architectures in real-world legal reasoning.

Method: The authors design MASLegalBench, a GDPR-based legal benchmark with extensive background knowledge and complex deductive reasoning tasks. They create various role-based MAS configurations and conduct extensive experiments using state-of-the-art LLMs to evaluate how MAS approaches perform on legal reasoning, knowledge integration, and task coordination.

Result: Empirical results highlight the strengths and limitations of current models and MAS architectures in handling legal tasks. The evaluation demonstrates where MAS-based approaches excel (e.g., in decomposition and specialization) and where improvements are needed (e.g., training, coordination, and long-horizon reasoning).

Conclusion: MASLegalBench provides a focused evaluation framework to study MAS in the legal domain, revealing promising directions and remaining challenges. It reflects the value of MAS for legal tasks while guiding future work on benchmark design, evaluation metrics, and agent coordination strategies.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

*An Guo,Shuoxiao Zhang,Enyi Tang,Xinyu Gao,Haomin Pang,Haoxiang Tian,Yanzhou Mu,Wu Wen,Chunrong Fang,Zhenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirical study of V2X cooperative perception identifying six error patterns and key vulnerabilities; LiDAR-based fusion performs best; V2I vs V2V depend on fusion scheme; more cooperative errors can increase driving violations; online systems are sensitive to interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of understanding of error types and their causes in V2X cooperative perception and quantify their impact on ego-perception and driving safety.

Method: Large-scale empirical study analyzing six prevalent error patterns in V2X cooperative perception, evaluating critical components across different fusion schemes and communication conditions, to assess impact on ego perception and driving behavior.

Result: LiDAR-based cooperation configuration yields the highest perception performance. V2I and V2V have distinct performance profiles under different fusion schemes. More cooperative errors may lead to higher driving-violation frequency. Cooperative perception systems are not robust to communication interference when running online.

Conclusion: Highlights risks and vulnerabilities in key components of cooperative perception systems and provides guidance for their design, evaluation, and repair.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

*Maximilian Nägele,Florian Marquardt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-driven agent (SciExplorer) uses tool-use to autonomously explore unknown physical systems and infer underlying laws (e.g., equations of motion, Hamiltonians) with minimal tooling; demonstrates domain-agnostic scientific exploration without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the open-ended loop of discovery—observations, analysis, hypothesis generation—in a domain-agnostic way, without task-specific blueprints or fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce SciExplorer, an agent leveraging large language model tool-use to perform free-form exploration with a minimal toolset (primarily code execution) on unknown physical systems (mechanics, waves, quantum many-body).

Result: Recovered equations of motion from dynamics; inferred Hamiltonians from expectation values; performed across diverse model classes; shows strong performance with minimal tooling.

Conclusion: This demonstrates the feasibility of domain-agnostic, self-guided scientific exploration and suggests potential extension to other domains without finetuning; could generalize to broader AI-assisted discovery.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

### [880] [CLPO: Curriculum Learning meets Policy Optimization for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25004)
*Shijie Zhang,Guohao Sun,Kevin Zhang,Xiang Guo,Rujun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLPO introduces a curriculum-guided approach to policy optimization in online RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for LLM reasoning. It uses the model’s own rollout performance to build an Online Curriculum and an Adaptive Problem Restructuring loop, enabling the model to self-teach by diversifying medium-difficulty problems and simplifying hard ones. This dynamic co-evolution yields strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR training treats all samples uniformly, causing inefficient exploration of mastered problems and insufficient guidance on tasks that are too difficult for the current model, limiting learning efficiency and upper-bound performance.

Method: CLPO constructs an Online Curriculum from real-time difficulty assessments based on the model's rollout performance, then applies Adaptive Problem Restructuring where the model acts as its own teacher to diversify medium-difficulty problems to promote generalization and simplify challenging problems to make them attainable.

Result: CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over competing methods.

Conclusion: By co-evolving the curriculum with the model’s capabilities, CLPO improves learning efficiency and upper-bound reasoning performance, demonstrating potential for training more capable reasoning models.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoPlay is a scalable two-stage pipeline that explores interactive environments to generate thousands of environment-grounded, executable tasks for post-training Multimodal LLMs, reducing annotation needs and boosting UI agent performance and RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of high-quality, diverse, down-stream agentic task datasets for post-training MLLMs. Current task-generation methods rely on costly human annotation or limited environment information, limiting coverage and scalability.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (i) exploration by an MLLM explorer to uncover new environment states and functionalities; (ii) task generation where a generator uses exploration trajectories and task-guideline prompts to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks grounded in environment data. Tasks are validated by an MLLM task executor and verifier, enabling demonstrations and RL rewards without human annotation.

Result: AutoPlay produced about 20k tasks across 20 Android apps and 10k tasks across 13 Ubuntu applications, enabling training of mobile-use and computer-use agents. Task demonstrations and verifier-based rewards improved success rates by up to 20.0% (mobile) and 10.9% (computer), with an additional 5.7% gain from RL training using verifier-based rewards.

Conclusion: AutoPlay offers a scalable solution for post-training capable MLLMs, reducing reliance on human annotation by automatically generating environment-grounded tasks and supporting improved agent performance and scalable RL training.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

*Sai Wang,Yu Wu,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CEL presents a planning-based agent that uses an LLM to build an explicit, language-based model of the environment and its strategy, refining rules and distilling a playbook after each episode; it learns grid-world games from scratch with sparse rewards, showing interpretability and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on opaque neural weights and data-hungry DRL by introducing explicit reasoning and transparent world models, enabling agents to learn via reflective planning.

Method: An LLM-powered agent, CEL, interacts with the environment, then after each episode performs Rule Induction to refine the environment dynamics model and Strategy/Playbook Summarization to create a practical playbook, all within a tabula rasa starting point.

Result: In Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, Sokoban, CEL masters games, discovering rules and developing effective policies; ablation studies show the iterative reflection-learning loop is essential for sustained gains.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a path toward general, interpretable agents that not only act well but also build explicit, improving world models through reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeDA is an intelligent multi-agent system that builds a large knowledge graph from 10k+ heatwave papers to uncover overlooked risk pathways and validate them, achieving high QA accuracy and identifying five high-impact risk chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmentation in climate-risk literature hinders integrated understanding of heatwave cascading risks; a unified discovery framework is needed.

Method: Developed HeDA, a multi-agent system that processes 10,247 papers to build a knowledge graph (23,156 nodes, 89,472 relationships) and applies multi-layer risk propagation analysis; evaluated on complex QA tasks against baselines including GPT-4; validated findings with historical case studies and domain experts.

Result: 78.9% accuracy on complex QA, 13.7% improvement over GPT-4 and other baselines; discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains, validated historically and via domain review.

Conclusion: Proposes a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery in climate risk, offering actionable insights to strengthen resilience and adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate

### [884] [From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25123)
*Lifan Yuan,Weize Chen,Yuchen Zhang,Ganqu Cui,Hanbin Wang,Ziming You,Ning Ding,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enables LLMs to acquire genuinely new compositional skills by combining learned functions, not just reweighting existing strategies; these skills generalize to longer compositions and transfer across tasks, while next-token training lacks these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolve whether reinforcement learning adds truly new capabilities to LLMs or merely reweights existing strategies; investigate generalization and transfer of compositional skills; mitigate data contamination with a synthetic framework.

Method: Define a skill as inferring the output of a string transformation f(x). Pretrain LLMs on f and g, then apply RL to incentivize learning h(x)=g(f(x)). Evaluate unseen compositions, extend to >2 functions, and test transfer to target tasks; compare with next-token training on the same data; analyze reasoning behavior qualitatively; use a synthetic, controlled setting to avoid contamination.

Result: RL enables learning unseen compositions of existing skills, including >2-function compositions; compositional skill learned on a source task transfers to a different target task without compositional training on the target; RL changes reasoning behaviors; next-token training yields none of these effects.

Conclusion: Build base models possessing basic skills first, then use RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable compositional skills for complex problems; RL can induce genuinely new abilities that generalize across tasks, unlike standard next-token training.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLHI introduces learning from in-the-wild human conversations with two methods: User-Guided Rewrites and User-Based Rewards to align models via persona-conditioned preferences; shows improvements on personalization, instruction-following, and reasoning benchmarks using WildChat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational agents rely on curated, expert-annotated feedback and fixed evaluation metrics, limiting continual improvement and multifaceted alignment. Real-world, long-term human interactions offer scalable supervision for personalized alignment.

Method: Two complementary approaches: (1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites, which revises outputs based on users' natural-language follow-ups; (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which learns a reward model conditioned on the user's long-term interaction history (persona). Both link persona to turn-level preferences through persona-conditioned preference optimization.

Result: Both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following on datasets derived from WildChat; similar feedback also improves performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Organic human interaction provides scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment, and RLHI is a practical framework to leverage such data for continual model improvement.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-perspective textual descriptions enable text-based analogical reasoning across images to improve VLN navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot LLM-based VLN agents either reduce visual input to simplistic scene descriptions or operate on raw images, which can miss abstract semantics and cross-image relations needed for high-level navigation decisions. There is a need for richer, cross-image semantic reasoning to enhance embodied navigation.

Method: Incorporate textual descriptions from multiple perspectives for each scene and enable analogical reasoning across images to improve global scene understanding and spatial reasoning. This leverages text-based analogical reasoning within the LLM (or an auxiliary module) to guide action decisions.

Result: Experiments on the R2R dataset show significant improvements in navigation performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Text-based analogical reasoning over multi-perspective textual descriptions enhances LLM-based VLN agents, yielding better navigation in embodied settings.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A memory-based framework (ReasoningBank) distills generalizable reasoning strategies from an agent's own successes and failures to improve performance over time, augmented by memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) that generates richer experiences via increased compute per task, yielding improved efficiency and effectiveness in real-world task settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents operating in persistent, real-world roles face continuous tasks and cannot rely on replaying only raw trajectories; forgetting and repeating errors is costly. A memory mechanism that captures generalizable reasoning patterns from past successes/failures, and scales interactions to create richer experiences, could enable self-improvement over time.

Method: ReasoningBank stores distilled reasoning strategies from self-judged successes and failures; at test time, the agent retrieves relevant memories to inform interaction and then integrates new learnings back. MaTTS allocates more compute per task to Generate abundant, diverse experiences, providing rich contrastive signals to synthesize higher-quality memory. This creates a synergy where memory enables better scaling, and scaling enriches memory.

Result: On web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, ReasoningBank outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness and efficiency. MaTTS amplifies these gains by further enhancing learning through richer experiences.

Conclusion: Memory-driven experience scaling defines a new scaling dimension in agent learning, enabling self-evolution of agents with emergent behaviors arising from the interplay between stored reasoning memories and test-time scaling.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: VLMs lag humans on visually grounded serial reasoning; increasing serial processing demands widens the VLM-human gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test if deficits in visually-grounded serial processing explain VLM underperformance on simple visual reasoning tasks.

Method: Compare humans and VLMs across geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation; manipulate serial processing load via concept complexity, individuation load, and transformation difficulty; measure accuracy and human reaction time as proxy for serial processing.

Result: A consistent pattern: higher serial processing load correlates with larger VLM-human performance gaps; VLM accuracy drops as human reaction time increases, indicating serial processing bottleneck.

Conclusion: Serial, visually grounded reasoning is a fundamental bottleneck distinguishing current VLMs from humans; addressing this could improve VLM reasoning.

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

### [889] [UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148)

TL;DR: UniAPL is a single-stage framework that learns from mixed SFT and preference data to align LLMs with expert demonstrations, addressing distributional mismatch and boosting instruction-following performance beyond the traditional SFT+RL pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training alignment is a unified Preference Learning problem with demonstrated (SFT) and comparative (RL) preferences. The standard SFT+RL pipeline suffers from distribution drift (SFT data is static while policy evolves) and ungrounded RL updates lacking rich expert knowledge, preventing mutual regularization between data sources.

Method: Propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL), a constrained optimization framework with a single-stage objective that jointly trains on mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense expert demonstrations ground and regularize online exploration, linking policy updates directly to expert knowledge. The approach dynamically aligns the policy distribution with the expert and evaluates on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher, showing improved data synergy between sources.

Result: Empirical gains: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B, even outperforming the teacher. Analyses show outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations via longer, more probed responses and favorable log-probability distributions, indicating stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Conclusion: UniAPL resolves distributional mismatch between SFT and RL, enables mutual regularization and data synergy through a single-stage training objective, and yields strong empirical gains in instruction-following tasks. The framework suggests broader applicability to other alignment data sources.

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We formalize judgment detection and introduce J-Detector, a lightweight, interpretable detector that uses judgment scores and candidate content (plus linguistic and LLM-enhanced features) to distinguish LLM-generated judgments from human ones, outperforming text-only detectors by capturing score-candidate interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated judgments can be biased and vulnerable, which is problematic in sensitive settings like academic peer review. There is a need to determine when judgments are produced by LLMs even without access to the full text.

Method: Formally define judgment detection and develop J-Detector, a lightweight neural detector augmented with linguistics-based features and LLM-enhanced features that link judges' biases to candidate properties. The detector operates on scores and candidates rather than text and is evaluated across diverse datasets.

Result: J-Detector demonstrates improved detection performance over baselines that rely on text-only detection, and its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.

Conclusion: Judgment detection is feasible and valuable for auditing LLM-based judgment processes. The work analyzes factors affecting detectability and demonstrates practical utility in real-world scenarios, with an emphasis on bias quantification and transparency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
