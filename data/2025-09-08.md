### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An experiment shows perceived risk in automated driving depends on driving style and interaction events; facial expressions are unreliable indicators; a neural network using motion and skin conductance can predict perceived risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand drivers' perceived risk and trust in automated vehicles and evaluate behavioral/physiological markers for objective risk assessment, addressing gaps in reliability of facial expressions.

Method: Driving simulator study with two automated driving styles (dynamic vs calm), with/without a crossing pedestrian; 32 participants; continuous subjective risk ratings plus multimodal data (motion, webcam facial expressions, skin conductance, heart rate, eye tracking); analysis of risk perception during critical events; neural network mapping motion+skin conductance to perceived risk.

Result: Cornering and braking events elicited significant perceived risk; dynamic driving style produced stronger discomfort than calm; pedestrian crossing increased discomfort only in dynamic style (doubling the comfort decrement); facial expressions: most participants showed no detectable reaction; of those who did, happiness was most common and fear was not dominant; facial expression is not a reliable risk indicator; motion+skin conductance-based neural network predicted perceived risk well, suggesting a viable objective assessment method.

Conclusion: Facial expressions are insufficient for risk assessment in automated vehicles; objective models using physiological and motion data can predict perceived risk and help reduce subjective bias; future work should refine models and explore additional indicators and contexts.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal prompt-rewriting framework, PromptEnhancer, uses a CoT rewriter trained with RL guided by AlignEvaluator to improve T2I image generation without fine-tuning the generator; yields better alignment and introduces a human preference benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between user intent and T2I outputs by addressing attribute binding, negation, and composition errors, without requiring model weight updates.

Method: Train a Chain-of-Thought rewriter via reinforcement learning, guided by AlignEvaluator—a 24-point taxonomy-based reward model—to optimize prompts for pretrained T2I models, decoupling the rewriter from the generator.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvement in image-text alignment across semantic and compositional challenges on HunyuanImage 2.1 and introduces a high-quality human preference benchmark.

Conclusion: A universal, model-agnostic prompt rewritting approach that enhances T2I outputs by refining prompts, with a framework for evaluation via a detailed human-aligned reward model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

*Hongyang Wei,Baixin Xu,Hongbo Liu,Cyrus Wu,Jie Liu,Yi Peng,Peiyu Wang,Zexiang Liu,Jingwen He,Yidan Xietian,Chuanxin Tang,Zidong Wang,Yichen Wei,Liang Hu,Boyi Jiang,William Li,Ying He,Yang Liu,Xuchen Song,Eric Li,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 2B DiT model (UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext) achieves state-of-the-art unified image generation and editing in a multimodal framework using Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement, and extends to UniPic2-Metaquery under Skywork UniPic 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source multimodal models often emphasize scaling parameters over training strategies, limiting efficiency and practical performance. A compact, versatile model capable of understanding, generating, and editing across modalities is highly desirable.

Method: Architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium, large-scale high-quality data pre-training for joint text-to-image generation and editing. Introduce Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement (PDTR) to reinforce both tasks in stages. After pre-training, connect via a connector to MetaQuery for UniPic2-Metaquery training, forming a unified multimodal framework under the Skywork UniPic 2.0 paradigm.

Result: Achieves stronger image generation and editing than significantly larger models (e.g., BAGEL 7B, Flux-Kontext 12B). Demonstrates mutual benefit of PDTR phases without negative interference. Extends to UniPic2-Metaquery with unified understanding, generation, and editing across tasks.

Conclusion: Proposes Skywork UniPic 2.0 as a scalable, generalizable training paradigm for unified multimodal models, with PDTR-enabled reinforcement showing cross-task benefits and a path to integrated, multimodal systems via MetaQuery.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag offers a universal, real-time drag-based image editing framework that converts user drag actions into pixel-space warping and inpainting, avoiding latent-space manipulation and enabling model-agnostic improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent-space editing suffers from limited precision, laggy feedback, and constraints tied to specific generative models; a direct pixel-space approach can deliver precise, fast edits and broad compatibility.

Method: Decompose edits into bidirectional pixel-space warping and inpainting; treat image regions as deformable materials; translate drag input into standard inpainting cues; provide fast previews (~0.01s) and inpainting (~0.3s) at 512x512; serve as a universal adapter to any inpainting model without architecture changes.

Result: Demonstrates superior visual quality and precise control with real-time performance; significant speed-ups compared to methods requiring minutes per edit; achieves 512x512 edits in real-time; adapter inherits future inpainting advances.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, model-agnostic drag-editing pipeline that can leverage ongoing improvements in inpainting models and provides improved user experience; potential for wider adoption and future improvements in physical-deformation-inspired editing.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based defense, DISPATCH, regenerates the entire image and rectifies adversarial patches for object detectors, achieving strong robustness against diverse and adaptive patch attacks with high mAP and reduced attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks that can hide real objects or create fake ones. There is a need for an effective, generalizable defense that is robust against unknown/adaptive threats, beyond detection/removal techniques.

Method: Introduce DISPATCH, a diffusion-model–based defense that regenerates the input image to align with benign data and then rectifies by replacing suspect regions with regenerated benign content. It is attack-agnostic and does not require prior knowledge of patches.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding and creating attacks across multiple detectors. Achieves a best mAP@0.5 of 89.3% on hiding attacks and lowers attack success rate to 24.8% for untargeted creating attacks, with strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: DISPATCH is the first diffusion-based defense for object detection, offering a practical, attack-agnostic, and robust solution that generalizes well to unknown threats and supports reliable object-detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH unifies world-aware camera–human motion to enable global pose reconstruction from monocular video by analytic heading decomposition and camera trajectory integration, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-the-wild benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is hampered by depth and motion ambiguities and the entanglement of camera and human movements. Existing motion-centric approaches underutilize camera orientation andTranslation cues, limiting global mapping accuracy. A joint camera–human modeling and effective camera translation integration are needed.

Method: Propose WATCH, a unified framework that (1) uses an analytical heading angle decomposition for efficient and extensible handling of heading information, and (2) introduces a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models to leverage camera translation cues beyond naive decoding, enabling end-to-end global trajectory reconstruction.

Result: WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance for end-to-end global trajectory reconstruction on in-the-wild benchmarks and demonstrates effective integration of camera orientation and translation cues.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling camera–human motion and integrating camera translation provides a powerful path toward resolving the camera–motion entanglement and depth/motion ambiguities in global human motion reconstruction, offering efficiency and extensibility over prior geometric methods; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware dense video captioning framework that weights frames by learned importance and adaptively retrieves captions using semantic-based scene segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense video captioning methods rely on timestamp supervision only for text and treat all video frames equally, and often retrieve captions from fixed-size video chunks, ignoring frame-level importance and scene transitions.

Method: Saliency-aware Video Reweighting converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights. Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions and improves caption retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing frame-level weighting and adaptive retrieval enhances performance in dense video captioning.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

*Ali Khanpour,Tianyi Wang,Afra Vahidi-Shams,Wim Ectors,Farzam Nakhaie,Amirhossein Taheri,Christian Claudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A UAV-based traffic surveillance system using multi-scale, multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography calibration to monitor urban traffic from ~200m, achieving high detection/tracking performance and enabling violation detection and rich mobility analytics in a scalable, infrastructure-free setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome fixed-camera limitations (limited coverage, adaptability, scalability) and enable enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring in unconstrained urban environments for smart cities.

Method: The system combines multi-scale/multi-angle template matching for vehicle detection, Kalman filtering for robust tracking, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video. It fuses geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis to automatically detect violations (unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, crosswalk obstructions). It supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle-count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling, plus entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation, and movement-direction logging.

Result: Empirical case study reports detection precision 91.8%, F1-score 90.5%, MOTA 92.1% and MOTP 93.7%. The system classifies five vehicle types and detects key violations. Demonstrates scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, positioning it as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent solution for next-generation smart cities.

Conclusion: The integrated UAV-based analytics platform delivers accurate detection and rich mobility analytics in unconstrained urban settings, with potential for scalable deployment in smart cities and enforcement-focused traffic monitoring.

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba blends CNN-style local feature extraction with multi-directional Mamba state-space models to capture global context in a hybrid vision backbone, achieving competitive accuracy with linear complexity and fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome CNNs' strong local inductive bias but weak global reasoning, and to surpass transformers/SSMs in capturing global context without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: A hierarchical backbone that uses a convolutional stem and early convolutional blocks to extract local features, followed by later stages that incorporate multi-directional Mamba blocks to model long-range dependencies and global context, maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, VCMamba-B attains 82.6% top-1 (0.3% above PlainMamba-L3) with 37% fewer parameters and outperforms Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. On ADE20K, it achieves 47.1 mIoU, surpassing EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU with 62% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN+SSM hybrid backbone leverages complementary strengths to deliver strong vision performance with reduced parameter count and linear complexity, supporting the viability of integrating local CNN inductive biases with global SSM reasoning for scalable vision backbones.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

### [10] [Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687)
*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, multi-agent framework enforces long, complex labeling guidelines in semantic segmentation by coordinating pre-existing vision-language models in a Worker–Supervisor loop with a lightweight stop policy, achieving strong guideline adherence and generalization without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications must produce accurate masks that comply with long, intricate labeling guidelines. Traditional methods require expensive retraining as guidelines evolve, and open-vocabulary methods struggle with paragraph-length rules, leading to guideline-noncompliant outputs.

Method: The approach uses a training-free, multi-agent refinement architecture: a Worker segmenter generates masks; a Supervisor critiques these masks against retrieved textual guidelines; and a lightweight reinforcement-learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop. This iterative process leverages general-purpose vision-language models and guideline retrieval to enforce complex rules without task-specific retraining.

Result: On Waymo and ReasonSeg, the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen guidelines and high adherence to instruction rules while balancing resource usage.

Conclusion: A training-free, multi-agent refinement framework can achieve guideline-consistent segmentation by leveraging existing vision-language models and guideline retrieval, reducing the need for costly retraining. Future work could explore failure cases, guideline quality impact, and application to other tasks with long-form constraints.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A practical cross-configuration domain adaptation approach for 3D object detection using downstream fine-tuning and partial layer fine-tuning to bridge sensor-config gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different LiDAR sensor configurations cause significant distribution shifts; prior work focuses on single-configuration or environmental/domain gaps, leaving cross-configuration adaptation underexplored. A scalable solution is needed for multi-platform deployment.

Method: Proposes two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of network layers). Trains on paired datasets collected in the same region with multiple sensor setups; compares against naive joint training.

Result: Joint training combined with downstream fine-tuning and partial layer fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration, demonstrating improved cross-configuration generalization.

Conclusion: Offers a practical and scalable strategy for adapting 3D object detection models to diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

### [12] [CD-Mamba: Cloud detection with long-range spatial dependency modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04729)
*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CD-Mamba is a hybrid cloud-detection network that fuses convolutional neural networks with Mamba's state-space modeling to capture both local pixel textures and long-range patch dependencies, improving cloud detection across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing clouds obscure imagery; robust cloud detection must handle short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities. CNNs capture local textures; Mamba excels at long-range dependencies. A unified model aims to combine strengths for improved accuracy.

Method: Introduce CD-Mamba, integrating convolutional layers with Mamba's state-space modeling into a single cloud-detection network to capture pixel-wise details and long-term patch-wise dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CD-Mamba achieves superior performance compared with existing cloud-detection methods.

Conclusion: A unified architecture that jointly models local textures and long-range dependencies yields improved cloud detection across diverse spatial scales.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise

### [13] [Exploiting Unlabeled Structures through Task Consistency Training for Versatile Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04732)
*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A versatile, annotation-efficient VMIS framework using Task Consistency Training (TCT) to tackle class imbalance in partially labeled datasets without extra models, by enforcing consistency between a main segmentation head and multiple auxiliary heads, with filtering of unreliable data and an auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss; validated across eight abdominal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VMIS with partially labeled datasets suffers from severe class imbalance, and existing pseudo-full-label methods require extra models and can degrade due to label noise. Aims to leverage unlabeled structures and provide a simple, model-efficient solution.

Method: Introduce a backbone with a main segmentation head (MSH) and multiple auxiliary task heads (ATHs). Enforce a consistency constraint between MSH and ATH predictions to exploit unlabeled anatomy. Add a filtering strategy to remove data with low consistency to curb error propagation. Propose a unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to balance segmentation quality across tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites show effectiveness in improving VMIS under PLDs and avoiding degradation from label noise, without needing additional models.

Conclusion: Task Consistency Training effectively mitigates class imbalance in VMIS with partially labeled data, leveraging unlabeled structures through cross-head consistency, reducing error propagation via data filtering, and balancing task predictions with UAUWL, with strong cross-site validation.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two uncertainty-aware strategies to improve driving image segmentation: (a) multi-step finetuning of SAM2 with an uncertainty-aware loss; (b) adapting the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT) to driving contexts. Evaluated on CamVid, BDD100K, GTA; results show UAT-SAM outperforms SAM in extreme weather, and SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss improves performance across diverse driving scenes; underscores value of uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM/SAM2 lack uncertainty quantification, leading to unreliable segmentation in adverse weather. The idea draws on medical imaging where uncertainty-aware training improves reliability in ambiguous cases, aiming to boost robustness for autonomous driving.

Method: 1) Multi-step fine-tuning of SAM2 incorporating uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function to improve scene recognition. 2) Adaptation of Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. Evaluation on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA datasets.

Result: UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather conditions. SAM2 with an uncertainty-aware loss shows improved performance across diverse driving scenes.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling is valuable for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Method: An end-to-end trainable architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference for audio and inertial data, optimized for smartwatch hardware to run on-device with multimodal fusion.

Result: Achieves 5x faster processing while maintaining >90% accuracy across 25+ activity classes; event detection ~9.3 ms and multimodal classification ~11.8 ms on smartwatch hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical on-device HAR on smartwatches, enabling privacy-aware, minimally invasive continuous activity tracking without external data processing.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet is a multi-label, multi-scale CNN for post-hurricane damage assessment that uses a Res2Net backbone and multi-head class-specific residual attention, achieving 92.35% mAP on RescueNet and interpretable CAM localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid and accurate post-disaster damage assessment requires capturing multi-scale spatial cues and distinguishing visually similar damage types; existing CNNs struggle with multi-label, fine-grained contexts.

Method: A Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone enriches spatial context across scales, combined with a multi-head class-specific residual attention module. Each attention branch targets different spatial granularities. Eight heads yielded best results. Evaluated on RescueNet (4,494 UAV images after Hurricane Michael).

Result: MCANet achieves mAP of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads, mAP rises to 92.35%, boosting average precision for challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping confirms localization of damage-relevant regions, supporting interpretability. Potential applications include post-disaster risk mapping, emergency routing, and digital-twin–based response.

Conclusion: MCANet advances multi-label post-disaster damage assessment by learning multi-scale representations with interpretable, class-specific attention. Future work could integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and semantic understanding for real-world decision making.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

### [17] [Dynamic Group Detection using VLM-augmented Temporal Groupness Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04758)
*Kaname Yokoyama,Chihiro Nakatani,Norimichi Ukita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic, graph-based approach for detecting groups in videos using local–global features from a Vision-Language Model, enabling temporal consistency and group evolution; outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting complex social groups in videos requires both local appearance cues and global scene context. Groups can change over time, unlike some previous methods that assume static groupings; a globally optimized, frame-spanning approach with groupness estimates can better capture dynamics.

Method: Extracts frame-level local and global features using a Vision-Language Model augmented for group detection. Estimates per-frame groupness via groupness-augmented CLIP features. Constructs a graph over all frames and performs global optimization to enforce temporal consistency of dynamically changing groups.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets; code is released (GitHub).

Conclusion: Dynamic group detection benefits from combining VLM-augmented features with graph-based temporal optimization, enabling robust detection of groups that evolve over time.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot flood-depth estimation by FloodVision fusing GPT-4o with a knowledge graph to ground object heights, achieving 8.17 cm MAE on 110 images, outperforming GPT-4o baseline and CNNs, with near real-time performance and strong cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need accurate, generalizable depth estimation in floods beyond fixed detectors and task-specific training to support road accessibility, emergency response, and smart-city resilience.

Method: Integrates GPT-4o semantic reasoning with a universal real-world object knowledge graph of canonical heights. The system identifies visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights to ground estimates, computes submergence ratios, and applies outlier filtering to produce depth estimates in a zero-shot framework.

Result: Mean absolute error of 8.17 cm on 110 MyCoast New York images; 20.5% improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (10.28 cm) and surpassing prior CNN-based methods; demonstrates cross-scene generalization and near real-time operation.

Conclusion: FloodVision shows a viable, generalizable approach to flood-depth estimation by grounding large-language-model reasoning in structured physical knowledge, enabling applications in digital twins and citizen reporting for smart-city flood resilience.

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

### [19] [Hybrid-Tower: Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04773)
*Bangxiang Lan,Ruobing Xie,Ruixiang Zhao,Xingwu Sun,Zhanhui Kang,Gang Yang,Xirong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-Tower framework (PIG) for Text-to-Video Retrieval that blends Two-Tower efficiency with Single-Tower effectiveness by introducing a pseudo-query generator that creates a per-video pseudo-query to enable fine-grained interaction, achieving gains in R@1 without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-Tower CLIP-based methods offer efficiency but lag in effectiveness; Single-Tower methods excel in accuracy but are less efficient. A hybrid approach could combine strengths of both.

Method: Propose a Hybrid-Tower architecture called PIG (Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR). It includes a pseudo-query generator that produces a pseudo-query for each video, enabling the video features and pseudo-query textual features to interact in a fine-grained way similar to Single-Tower, before the real text query arrives. Crucially, inference incurs no additional storage or computation compared to Two-Tower.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five standard T2VR benchmarks shows R@1 improvements ranging from 1.6% to 3.9% over the baseline. The method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while approaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Hybrid-Tower framework with PIG effectively combines strengths of Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, delivering high effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLP-SRGAN: a lightweight, single-dimension SRGAN using MLP-Mixers with CNNs for slice-direction upsampling in MRI FLAIR. Claims sharper edges, preserved texture with fewer params and faster training, plus new no-reference IQA metrics; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve MRI super-resolution in the slice direction with a compact model that preserves fine anatomical detail, enabling better cross-center generalization and practical deployment without reliance on ground-truth HR images.

Method: Introduce MLP-SRGAN architecture that couples MLP-Mixers with convolutional layers to upsample in the slice dimension. Train/validate on HR FLAIR from MSSEG2 and test on unseen CAIN, ADNI, CCNA datasets. Use PSNR/SSIM when HR ground truths exist and propose new no-reference metrics for sharpness, noise, and blur. Compare against state-of-the-art SR networks.

Result: MLP-SRGAN yields sharper edges, less blur, better texture and anatomical detail, with fewer parameters, faster training/evaluation, and smaller model size than competing methods; demonstrates improved performance on held-out multicentre clinical data.

Conclusion: The proposed MLP-SRGAN is an effective, efficient architecture for slice-direction MRI super-resolution, offering improved quality with reduced model complexity. The authors also present no-reference IQA metrics and will release code and data pipelines.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cross-modality lunar image registration is vital for surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning, enabling alignment of optical, hyperspectral, and radar data under varying resolutions and illuminations.

Method: Compare five feature matchers (SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, SuperGlue) using a preprocessing pipeline (georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, adaptive histogram equalization, PCA, shadow correction) across equatorial and polar cross-modality image pairs.

Result: SuperGlue achieves the lowest RMSE and fastest runtimes; classical methods (SIFT, AKAZE) work well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.

Conclusion: Preprocessing and learning-based matchers are key for robust cross-modality lunar image registration across diverse conditions; the proposed pipeline yields robust performance across equatorial and polar regions.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ModelNet40, a widely used benchmark for 3D point-cloud classification, suffers from inconsistencies such as labeling issues, presence of 2D data, mismatched object sizes, and weak inter-class differentiation, which impede reliable model evaluation and progress.

Method: Create ModelNet-R by meticulously refining labels, removing 2D data influences, aligning object sizes, and ensuring clear class differentiation; develop Point-SkipNet, a lightweight graph-based network that uses efficient sampling, neighborhood grouping, and skip connections to reduce computation while preserving accuracy; conduct extensive experiments comparing models trained on ModelNet-R vs. original benchmarks.

Result: Models trained on ModelNet-R show significant performance gains. Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with substantially fewer parameters than comparable models.

Conclusion: Dataset quality is crucial for achieving efficient and accurate 3D point-cloud classification. ModelNet-R provides a more reliable benchmark, and Point-SkipNet demonstrates that careful architectural design can yield high accuracy with low computational cost.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large, real-world, mobile-captured skin disease datasets and the need for accessible, accurate diagnostics in resource-limited environments; go beyond dermoscopic datasets and conventional CNNs.

Method: Assemble a dataset of >50 skin disease classes captured with mobile devices; evaluate multiple CNNs and Transformer architectures, with emphasis on Swin Transformer; apply Grad-CAM for visual explanations.

Result: Transformer models, especially Swin Transformer, achieve superior performance; Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant regions and improves transparency.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches are promising for mobile-based dermatological screening in resource-limited settings and can facilitate early diagnosis.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological
screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

### [24] [Extracting Uncertainty Estimates from Mixtures of Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04816)
*Svetlana Pavlitska,Beyza Keskin,Alwin Faßbender,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixtures of experts (MoEs) for semantic segmentation can yield better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than ensembles, with simple gating providing well-calibrated routing uncertainty; more experts may further improve calibration; demonstrated on A2D2 and Cityscapes, with code available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is crucial for safety-critical computer vision tasks (e.g., traffic scene perception). MoEs offer an efficient alternative to ensembles by dynamically weighting expert predictions, potentially improving uncertainty estimation without architectural changes.

Method: Two-expert MoE trained on a semantic split of the A2D2 dataset. Uncertainty is extracted via predictive entropy, mutual information, and expert variance. Routing uncertainty is assessed via gate entropy. Compared against ensembles. Additional experiments on Cityscapes examine the effect of increasing the number of experts.

Result: MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles under out-of-distribution data when measured by conditional correctness metrics. Routing uncertainty calibration is better with simple gating than with complex classwise gates. On Cityscapes, increasing the number of experts further improves uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: MoEs can provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainty without changing architecture; gating design affects calibration, and more experts can improve performance. Code is available at the authors’ repository.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to improve efficiency and precision in light field image super-resolution (LFSR), plus a dual-stage modeling flow (SA-RSMB in stage I; EPMB+EPTB in stage II) within a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework (LFMT). Claims state-of-the-art performance with low computation on real and synthetic LF data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-directional scanning strategies for light field data cause inefficient and redundant feature extraction on complex LF data. There is a need to enhance long-range information modeling with linear complexity while preserving spatial-angular-disparity information.

Method: Introduce Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB). Develop a dual-stage modeling strategy: stage I uses Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular features; stage II uses a dual-branch parallel structure combining Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework (LFMT) to integrate Mamba and Transformer strengths across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.

Result: LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in light field super-resolution (LFSR) on real and synthetic LF datasets, achieving substantial improvements in performance with low computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed Sub-SS and LFMT framework enable more efficient and comprehensive exploration of spatial-angular and epipolar-plane information, delivering superior LFSR performance with reduced computational burden compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

### [26] [PropVG: End-to-End Proposal-Driven Visual Grounding with Multi-Granularity Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04833)
*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiedong Zhuang,Jiang-jiang Liu,Hongshen Zhao,Zhenhua Feng,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PropVG is an end-to-end proposal-based visual grounding framework that integrates foreground object proposals with referential grounding, featuring Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) and Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD); it works without extra detectors and shows strong results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage proposal-based methods are inefficient; end-to-end methods focusing only on the referred target miss potential gains from other prospective targets and often lack multi-granularity discrimination needed in complex scenes.

Method: PropVG integrates foreground proposal generation into an end-to-end pipeline; CRS module applies contrastive learning at sentence and word levels to better distinguish referred objects; MTD module fuses object- and semantic-level information to recognize absent targets; evaluated on multiple benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, RefCOCO REC/RES demonstrate effectiveness; code released.

Conclusion: PropVG is the first end-to-end proposal-based grounding framework without extra detectors, improving robustness via CRS and MTD and showing strong performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

### [27] [TemporalFlowViz: Parameter-Aware Visual Analytics for Interpreting Scramjet Combustion Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04834)
*Yifei Jia,Shiyu Cheng,Yu Dong,Guan Li,Dong Tian,Ruixiao Peng,Xuyi Lu,Yu Wang,Wei Yao,Guihua Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz is a visual analytics workflow that analyzes large-scale, high-dimensional temporal flow-field data from scramjet simulations by extracting frame embeddings with Vision Transformers, clustering to reveal latent combustion modes, and pairing these with a vision-language summarization system to generate natural-language explanations. It supports expert-driven interpretation, filtering, and retrieval across many cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed scramjet simulations produce massive, time-resolved flow-field data that are difficult to visualize, compare, and interpret. There is a need to connect latent data representations to expert reasoning and to facilitate cross-case analysis.

Method: Extract frame embeddings using pretrained Vision Transformers; apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to identify latent combustion modes; construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track evolution; domain experts annotate cluster centroids; use these annotations as contextual prompts for a vision-language model to generate natural-language summaries for individual frames and entire simulations; support parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration.

Result: Two expert-informed case studies and feedback demonstrate that TemporalFlowViz supports hypothesis generation, interpretable pattern discovery, and knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet analysis.

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz bridges latent representations with expert reasoning by incorporating explained centroids and NL summaries, enabling efficient interpretation and discovery in large-scale temporal flow data from scramjet simulations.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

*Enze Ye,Wei Lin,Shaochi Ren,Yakun Liu,Xiaoping Li,Hao Wang,He Sun,Feng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose-free 3D refractive-index tomography for flowing cells enables high-throughput, label-free morphometrics across arbitrary shapes using sparse views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-cytometry QPI relies on uniform single-axis rotation and known poses, biasing analysis toward near-spherical cells and limiting population-level insights. There is a need for unbiased, scalable 3D imaging of diverse cell geometries in flow.

Method: OmniFHT combines the Fourier diffraction theorem with implicit neural representations (INRs) to jointly optimize each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric RI distribution under weak scattering. It supports arbitrary geometries and multi-axis rotations, using a continuous representation to reconstruct from sparse projections (as few as 10 views or 120°).

Result: Demonstrates high-fidelity 3D RI reconstructions from sparsely sampled angular data in flow, enabling in situ tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations and providing scalable, unbiased morphometric analysis.

Conclusion: A pose-free framework for robust 3D QPI in flow cytometry that extends imaging to irregularly shaped cells, enabling comprehensive, high-throughput morphometrics across diverse populations.

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

*Hannah Schieber,Dominik Frischmann,Simon Boche,Victor Schaack,Angela Schoellig,Stefan Leutenegger,Daniel Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS speeds up semantic Gaussian Splatting for mobile/autonomous aerial robotics by producing a coarse, segmentation-ready scene and then refining the target object with color-based filtering, cutting training time to ~25% of a full cycle while improving novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mobile autonomous aerial tasks, rapid, accurate 3D reconstruction is vital, with focus on points of interest (PoIs) to avoid full-scene optimization. Semantic edits enable isolating PoIs and speeding up processing.

Method: A two-stage semantic GS pipeline: (1) generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene using semantic Gaussian Splatting; (2) refine the semantic object of interest with a novel color-based effective filtering to isolate the PoI, reducing training time. Evaluation on SCRREAM (real outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic indoor).

Result: Training time is reduced to about a quarter of a full semantic GS training cycle, with higher novel-view-synthesis quality.

Conclusion: CoRe-GS achieves a favorable balance between reconstruction quality and training speed for POI-focused tasks in mobile robotics and demonstrates effective semantic editing that speeds up semantic 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

*Trixia Simangan,Ahmed Nadeem Abbasi,Yipeng Hu,Shaheer U. Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cryo-RL uses reinforcement learning to plan prostate cryoablation, modeling planning as an MDP to optimally place cryoprobes and select ice sphere diameters in a simulated, constraint-aware environment; it outperforms automated baselines and matches human experts while reducing planning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual cryoablation planning is expertise-driven, time-consuming, and variable in quality, limiting scalability. An automated, reproducible, and efficient planning approach could standardize treatment quality and reduce planning time.

Method: An RL agent operates in a simulated clinical environment with constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability. It sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters, guided by a reward based on tumor coverage. The model is trained to maximize coverage while respecting safety constraints, evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases.

Result: Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point improvements in Dice coefficient compared with the best automated baselines based on geometric optimization and matched human expert performance, while requiring substantially less planning time.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can yield clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans, suggesting strong potential for scalable, high-quality preoperative planning in prostate cancer cryoablation.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

*Dominik Pegler,David Steyrl,Mengfan Zhang,Alexander Karner,Jozsef Arato,Frank Scharnowski,Filip Melinscak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained computer vision models can predict fear levels from spider images with MAE ~10–11 on a 0–100 scale; dataset size is critical; explainability ties predictions to spider features; some visual conditions yield higher errors; supports using explainable CV for emotion-aware therapy but requires sufficient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance adaptive exposure therapy by predicting subjective fear from visual stimuli; assess reliability and explainability of CV models in this domain.

Method: Fine-tune three diverse pretrained CV models using transfer learning on a 313-image spider dataset to predict fear ratings; evaluate with cross-validation; analyze learning curves, explainability, and category-wise errors.

Result: Mean absolute error around 10.1–11.0 across models; learning curves show performance deteriorates with smaller datasets but plateaus with larger data; explainability confirms reliance on spider-related features; higher errors for distant views and artificial/painted spiders.

Conclusion: Explainable CV predictors of fear are feasible and potentially useful for emotion-aware therapies, but success hinges on sufficient data and careful consideration of confounding visual conditions.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

TL;DR: A method to generate synthetic rust wear data via a vision-language model and a 3D renderer, enabling CV models for rust detection with high mAP50 (0.87) on real images; adaptable to other wear scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data curation for wear-and-tear CV models is costly due to scarce datasets; scalable synthetic data generation is needed for predictive maintenance across industries.

Method: Combine a vision-language model with a 3D simulation/rendering engine to create labeled synthetic images of varying rust conditions; train a rust-detection CV model on synthetic data; evaluate on real rust images.

Result: The model trained on synthetic data achieves mAP50 of 0.87, outperforming alternative approaches.

Conclusion: The approach is customizable and extendable to other industrial wear/tear detection tasks, addressing data scarcity for predictive maintenance.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

*Maryam Adelipour,Gustavo Carneiro,Jeongkwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple bag-level aggregation with an MLP baseline robustly counts sebocyte droplets in Nile Red images; an attention-based MIL approach is less stable and often underperforms unless properly regularized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate the labor-intensive and subjective process of counting intracellular lipid droplets in sebocytes to enable scalable, objective quantification.

Method: Nile Red-stained sebocyte images labeled into 14 classes by droplet counts, expanded to ~50k cells via data augmentation. Two models: (1) baseline MLP trained on aggregated patch-level counts; (2) attention-based MIL using ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Evaluation via five-fold cross-validation.

Result: Baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) than attention-based MIL (mean MAE = 10.7); MIL was less consistent but occasionally better in specific folds.

Conclusion: Simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting in sebocyte images, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling strategies and regularization to consistently outperform baselines.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

*Haowang Cui,Rui Chen,Tao Luo,Rui Li,Jiaze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniView introduces a retrieval-augmented, reference-guided single-image view synthesis with a decoupled triple attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image novel-view synthesis is highly ill-posed, as unobserved regions admit multiple explanations. Existing methods rely on ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views, causing distortions. To mitigate this, UniView leverages strong priors from similar objects via retrieved reference images, guided by a multimodal language model, to improve view synthesis.

Method: Build a retrieval and augmentation system to obtain reference images. Use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting reference images that satisfy requirements. Introduce a plug-and-play adapter with multi-level isolation layers to dynamically generate reference features for target views. Employ a decoupled triple attention mechanism to align and integrate multi-branch features into the synthesis process.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: UniView demonstrates that leveraging retrieved references and decoupled attention yields more accurate and detail-preserving novel-view synthesis from a single image, addressing distortions common in prior methods and establishing a new performance baseline.

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper leverages dual visual encoders and a GPT-2–based mapper to connect video features to a text-to-audio model, achieving better semantic/temporal consistency with substantially less training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video-to-audio models from scratch is resource-intensive. Foundation models offer cross-modal knowledge transfer, but effective alignment between vision and audio generation remains challenging; prior lightweight mapper using a single visual encoder limits information.

Method: Fuse richer semantic/temporal features from two visual encoders and replace a linear mapper with GPT-2 to perform autoregressive style feature mapping from vision to text-to-audio generation.

Result: Improved semantic and temporal consistency with notably higher training efficiency: using only about 16% of the training scale of prior mapper-based work, while remaining competitive with models trained on much larger scales.

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper demonstrates effective cross-modal alignment with foundation models for V2A, achieving efficiency gains and maintaining competitive performance, and suggests autoregressive mapping as a promising direction for vision-to-audio pipelines.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion proposes a dual-domain, VLM-guided fusion framework for degraded dual-source infrared-visible inputs, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and falter under dual-source degradation, often requiring manual pre-enhancement and incurring error accumulation; a unified perception-fusion approach is needed.

Method: Introduces Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) to perform frequency-domain degradation perception and extract fusion-relevant sub-band features; and Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) for cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature aggregation in the spatial domain; leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to perceive degradations and guide fusion in both domains.

Result: Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with existing methods in dual-source degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion integrates degradation perception with dual-domain fusion, improving robustness and fusion quality in degraded IVIF tasks; code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark ML and DL methods for ultrasound-based breast cancer classification across multiple datasets and assess accuracy, sensitivity, and interpretability for clinical adoption.

Method: Experimentally compare classical ML models (SVM, KNN) and CNN architectures (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, GoogLeNet) on BUSI, BUS-BRA, and BrEaST-Lesions USG datasets; report accuracy and sensitivity; apply Grad-CAM for visual explanations.

Result: ResNet-18 achieves 99.7% accuracy with perfect malignant-sensitivity; classical ML methods are outperformed by CNNs but can be competitive when supplemented with deep feature extraction; Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant regions.

Conclusion: AI-based diagnostic tools for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection are feasible and can be integrated into clinical workflows; interpretable, high-performing systems are attainable.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

TL;DR: Introduces Dark-traffic dataset and SLVM, a biologically inspired, separable-learning vision model for low-light traffic perception, achieving state-of-the-art results with lower computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light traffic scenes degrade illumination and cues, hindering perception; lack of large-scale, annotated benchmarks; need for fast, accurate multi-task perception under adverse lighting.

Method: Propose physically grounded illumination degradation, construct Dark-traffic with annotations for detection, segmentation, optical flow; present SLVM with four components: light-adaptive pupillary feature extraction, feature-level separable learning, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task learning, spatial misalignment-aware fusion; train on Dark-traffic and LIS benchmark; compare to strong baselines.

Result: SLVM achieves state-of-the-art on Dark-traffic: +11.2 pp in detection vs RT-DETR, +6.1 pp in instance segmentation vs YOLOv12, EPE reduced by 12.37%; on LIS benchmark, outperforms Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by ~11 pp on average, and surpasses Mask RCNN with light enhancement by 3.1 pp; dataset and code released at https://github.com/alanli1997/slvm.

Conclusion: SLVM offers improved perception under adverse lighting with reduced computational overhead; the Dark-traffic dataset and the accompanying code are valuable resources to advance low-light perception research.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TL with mobile-enabled CNNs improves Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR); MobileNet is the top performer, with full fine-tuning generally best; IFHCDB yields near-perfect accuracy (99% with MnasNet).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational load and data scarcity in AHCR by leveraging transfer learning and lightweight mobile CNNs to achieve accurate, efficient recognition.

Method: Evaluate three transfer-learning strategies—full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from scratch—on four lightweight MbNets (MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, ShuffleNet) across three AHCR datasets (AHCD, HIJJA, IFHCDB). Compare accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.

Result: MobileNet emerges as the top model overall; ShuffleNet excels in generalization, especially under full fine-tuning. IFHCDB yields the highest results (99% accuracy with MnasNet under full fine-tuning); AHCD attains 97% with ShuffleNet; HIJJA is challenging, peaking at 92% with ShuffleNet. Full fine-tuning provides the best balance of accuracy and convergence speed; partial fine-tuning underperforms across metrics.

Conclusion: Transfer-learning with lightweight MbNets is a promising path for resource-efficient Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition. Future work could explore architectural modifications, deeper feature analysis, data augmentation strategies, and advanced sensitivity analyses to improve robustness and generalization.

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with
mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic
Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive
computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

*Cong Cao,Xianhang Cheng,Jingyuan Liu,Yujian Zheng,Zhenhui Lin,Meriem Chkir,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUIVITON is an end-to-end automated virtual try-on system that drapes multi-layer clothing onto diverse, arbitrarily posed characters. It uses SMPL as a proxy and decomposes clothing-to-body fitting into two tasks: clothing-to-SMPL via geometric learning for partial-to-complete shape fitting, and body-to-SMPL via diffusion-model-based alignment leveraging multi-view appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. It generalizes to humans, robots, cartoons, creatures, and aliens, is computationally efficient, and supports post-fit clothing size and material customization without human labor, even when 2D sewing patterns are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of aligning complex, multi-layer garments to highly diverse and arbitrarily posed bodies is hard. Existing methods struggle with generalization to non-standard shapes, multi-layer clothing, and lack of automatic, end-to-end solutions. A fully automatic, generalizable pipeline is needed for practical virtual try-on across varied subjects.

Method: Adopts SMPL as a proxy and splits dressing into two correspondence tasks: (1) clothing-to-SMPL using a geometric, learning-based partial-to-complete shape correspondence predictor; (2) body-to-SMPL using a diffusion-model-based approach that leverages multi-view appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. The system handles non-manifold meshes, generalizes to diverse humanoids (humans, robots, cartoons, creatures, aliens), and enables fast clothing size/material customization after draping.

Result: Capable of producing high-quality 3D clothing fittings without human labor, even when 2D sewing patterns are unavailable; robust to complex geometries and non-standard body shapes; generalizes across a wide range of humanoid subjects; maintains practical computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LUIVITON offers a fully automatic, generalizable virtual try-on pipeline that can handle multi-layer clothing and diverse characters. The diffusion-based body-to-SMPL alignment complements the geometric clothing-to-SMPL fitting, enabling practical adoption with post-drape sizing and material customization.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

*Jingqi Wu,Hanxi Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Hao Chen,Deyin Liu,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADClick introduces an interactive image segmentation approach for industrial anomaly detection that uses only a few user clicks and a brief description to produce pixel-level defect masks, boosting AD performance; ADClick-Seg extends to cross-modal, prototype-based alignment of visual features and textual prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec AD, including multi-class settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial anomaly detection (AD) relies on abundant non-defective samples; defect annotations at the pixel level are costly and limit scalability. There is a need for annotation-efficient, high-performance AD that can leverage minimal human input and language cues.

Method: ADClick uses a few user clicks plus a short textual description to generate precise pixel-wise anomaly masks for supervision. ADClick-Seg is a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features with textual prompts through a prototype-based approach to enable anomaly detection and localization.

Result: On MVTec AD, ADClick achieves AP 96.1%. For the challenging Multi-class AD task on MVTec AD, ADClick-Seg reports AP 80.0%, PRO 97.5%, Pixel-AUROC 99.1%.

Conclusion: Combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues yields strong, annotation-efficient anomaly detection and localization, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-class AD and improving practicality for industrial inspection.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

TL;DR: DL generative models show potential in detecting and correcting MRI motion artifacts, but generalizability is limited by data constraints and risk of distortions; standardized datasets and reporting are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and meta-analyze AI-driven methods for MRI motion artifact detection and correction, assessing current developments, effectiveness, and challenges to guide future research.

Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on deep learning approaches, especially generative models, for motion artifact detection/correction in MRI. Extraction of quantitative data on datasets, architectures, and performance metrics.

Result: DL/generative models can reduce motion artifacts and improve image quality, but limited generalizability, dependence on paired training data, and risk of visual distortions are key challenges. Calls for standardized datasets and reporting.

Conclusion: AI-driven DL generative methods have substantial potential to improve MRI image quality and diagnostic accuracy, but must address data availability, reporting standards, and more adaptable techniques to reduce reliance on paired data.

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

### [43] [GeoSplat: A Deep Dive into Geometry-Constrained Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05075)
*Yangming Li,Chaoyu Liu,Lihao Liu,Simon Masnou,Carola-Bibian Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat is a geometry-constrained optimization framework for Gaussian splatting that uses first- and second-order geometry to improve initialization, updates, and densification, with curvature-based initialization and robust local priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works on Gaussian splatting relied on low-order geometric priors (e.g., normals) and noise-sensitive estimates (e.g., PCA), leading to unreliable geometric guidance. GeoSplat aims to make geometry a core, robust component of the training pipeline to improve quality and stability in novel view synthesis.

Method: GeoSplat introduces a general optimization framework that exploits both first- and second-order geometric quantities. It initializes Gaussian scales from principal curvatures to better cover object surfaces and employs efficient, noise-robust estimation methods based on local manifold structures to provide dynamic geometric priors during training (initialization, gradient updates, and densification).

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis show that GeoSplat significantly improves Gaussian splatting performance and outperforms previous baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating rich geometric structure into Gaussian splatting yields robust, higher-quality reconstructions and better coverage of object surfaces, advancing the state of the art in geometry-informed NeRF-like representations.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

### [44] [Scale-interaction transformer: a hybrid cnn-transformer model for facial beauty prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05078)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-Transformer hybrid (Scale-Interaction Transformer) captures multi-scale facial features and their interactions, achieving state-of-the-art on SCUT-FBP5500 (Pearson 0.9187) for Facial Beauty Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs process features at fixed scales and may miss inter-scale dependencies critical for perceptual judgments. There is a need to model relationships across receptive fields to improve FBP.

Method: Introduce Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT) that uses a multi-scale module with parallel convolutions to obtain multi-receptive-field features; treat these as a sequence and feed into a Transformer encoder to model inter-scale interactions via self-attention.

Result: On SCUT-FBP5500, SIT achieves new state-of-the-art with Pearson correlation 0.9187, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Modeling inter-scale cue interactions is crucial for high-performance FBP; hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures show promise for complex image regression tasks requiring holistic context.

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

*Svetlana Pavlitska,Haixi Fan,Konstantin Ditschuneit,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inserting a single sparse MoE layer into deeper stages of ResNet trained on CIFAR-100 improves adversarial robustness under PGD/AutoPGD with adversarial training; switch loss can cause routing collapse to a few experts, concentrating training and producing robust, specialized subpaths that can outperform a gated MoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve CNN robustness to adversarial attacks without increasing inference cost by leveraging sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) to boost capacity and resilience.

Method: Replace selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with sparse MoE layers in ResNet architectures trained on CIFAR-100; train with adversarial training; evaluate robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks; investigate the effect of the switch loss on routing behavior.

Result: A single MoE layer in the deeper stages yields consistent robustness gains under PGD and AutoPGD; use of switch loss causes routing to collapse onto a small set of overused experts, concentrating adversarial training on these paths and increasing robustness; some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model, indicating robust subpaths emerge through specialization.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE layers can enhance robustness without extra inference cost, but routing dynamics (e.g., switch loss) critically shape which experts become robust; robust subpaths emerge via specialization, suggesting potential for designing robust, specialized subnetworks.

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

*Mainak Biswas,Ambedkar Dukkipati,Devarajan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT enables source-free, semi-supervised regression transfer using Contradistinguisher, yielding RMSE gains under label scarcity and beating SF-DA baselines on neuroscience benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and practicality prevent sharing source data; domain shift degrades performance; need methods that use unlabeled target data and pretrained models without accessing source data or aligning representations.

Method: CRAFT extends Contradistinguisher (CUDA) to source-free semi-supervised regression. It learns a shared model across labeled source and unlabeled target samples without intermediate representation alignment, enabling transfer from pretrained models to the target domain.

Result: On EEG gaze and MRI brain-age tasks, CRAFT achieved up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuning with scarce labels; outperformed four SF-DA methods by >3%; also demonstrated on two additional real-world regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT provides an efficient, effective solution for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer in regression, with broad applicability in biology and medicine.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

*Arianna Rampini,Kanika Madan,Bruno Roy,AmirHossein Zamani,Derek Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based method reconstructs high-quality 3D textures directly from a single image and a mesh, without UV maps or differentiable rendering, using a triplane representation with depth-based backprojection to achieve fast (0.2s) single-pass texture generation and superior fidelity to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, controllable textures are essential for realistic 3D content, but existing methods are slow, rely on UV maps or differentiable rendering, and may not faithfully reproduce a reference image. A UV-free, fast, single-pass solution could significantly improve scalability and practicality for 3D content creation.

Method: The approach uses a transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a single image and a mesh. It integrates a triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses to enable efficient training and fast inference, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable rendering. Inference is a single forward pass (~0.2s per shape).

Result: Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations show the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in single-image texture reconstruction, achieving higher fidelity to the input image and better perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed UV-free, single-pass texture prediction pipeline offers scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D texture creation with significantly faster inference, reducing bottlenecks from UV mapping and rendering while maintaining fidelity to reference images.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

*Chaolei Wang,Yang Luo,Jing Du,Siyu Chen,Yiping Chen,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-grow SGS-3D refines 2D-to-3D lifted masks into high-fidelity 3D instances by purifying masks with geometric primitive cues and then growing complete instances using spatial continuity, without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D instance segmentation from lifted 2D masks suffers from accumulated errors due to ambiguous semantic guidance and weak depth constraints; a training-free refinement that fuses semantic and geometric information is needed to improve accuracy and robustness across scenes.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) split/purify semantic masks by filtering ambiguous lifted masks via the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives; (2) grow refined masks into full 3D instances by leveraging spatial continuity and high-level features, jointly leveraging semantic and geometric cues; no additional training required; demonstrates strong generalization across indoor/outdoor data.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 show substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness to noisy pre-trained masks, yielding high-fidelity 3D object instances and strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: SGS-3D provides a training-free refinement framework that improves 3D instance segmentation by splitting ambiguous lifted masks through geometric priors and growing them into complete instances, effectively combining semantic guidance with geometry for reliable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

### [49] [SL-SLR: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05188)
*Ariel Basso Madjoukeng,Jérôme Fink,Pierre Poitier,Edith Belise Kenmogne,Benoit Frenay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised SLR framework with free-negative pairs and a novel video augmentation improves representation learning, outperforming existing contrastive/self-supervised methods in linear, semi-supervised, and cross-language transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLR data is scarce and standard contrastive learning treats all video parts equally, while shared movements create highly similar negatives, hindering discriminative learning.

Method: Proposes two components: (i) a self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs to better separate informative cues; (ii) a new data augmentation technique tailored for sign videos to emphasize informative segments and reduce confusion between signs.

Result: The approach yields significant accuracy gains over several contrastive and self-supervised baselines across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns discriminative, transferable representations for SLR under limited labels, addressing both the relevance weighting of video parts and negative-pair similarity, with potential applicability to other video tasks with localized informative cues.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

*Yassine Taoudi-Benchekroun,Klim Troyan,Pascal Sager,Stefan Gerber,Lukas Tuggener,Benjamin Grewe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGITAO is a modular data-generation framework and benchmark for studying compositionality/generalization in visual domains. It enables millions of rule-based transformations on grid-like scenes, supports compositional depth, and shows baseline vision models struggle to generalize to novel combinations; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in assessing systematic compositional generalization in vision models: strong in-domain performance but poor ability to recombine familiar elements in new ways. A scalable, controllable benchmark is needed.

Method: Introduce COGITAO, a modular framework to generate rule-based tasks by applying a set of 28 transformations to objects in grid-like environments. Supports composition to adjustable depth, extensive grid/object parametrization, and virtually unlimited samples per rule. Provides baseline experiments with state-of-the-art vision models.

Result: Baseline models fail to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO can produce millions of unique task rules across varying difficulty; provides scalable sample generation; datasets and code are open-source.

Conclusion: COGITAO offers a scalable, open platform to study compositionality in vision, enabling systematic benchmarking and progress toward models capable of true compositional generalization.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

*Yamei Chen,Haoquan Zhang,Yangyi Huang,Zeju Qiu,Kaipeng Zhang,Yandong Wen,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGP-GenBench to benchmark LLMs' ability to generate symbolic graphics programs for SVGs, shows frontier proprietary models outperform open-source ones, and presents an RL-based method with verifiable rewards to improve LLM SVG generation, achieving frontier-level performance on Qwen-2.5-7B; it further analyzes training dynamics and argues symbolic graphics provide a precise cross-modal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs can generate accurate, compositional graphics from natural language and to assess how well current models capture the visual world via symbolic graphics programs.

Method: Develop SGP-GenBench with object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality metrics; evaluate LLMs; propose RL with verifiable rewards: a format-validity gate for renderable SVG and cross-modal rewards using SigLIP (text-image) and DINO (image-image); apply to Qwen-2.5-7B.

Result: Frontier proprietary models outperform open-source models on SGP-GenBench; the RL approach substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems; training dynamics show RL leads to finer object decomposition into primitives and better scene coherence.

Conclusion: Symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding and visual understanding in LLMs; with improved training strategies, open models can close much of the gap to frontier systems for generating accurate, renderable SVGs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online 3D reconstruction methods often face a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance. There is a need for accurate, fast online camera pose estimation and dense maps.

Method: A sliding window mechanism enables information exchange across frames within the window; a compact camera representation is used along with a global camera token pool to stabilize pose estimation while maintaining efficiency; the model is feed-forward for online operation.

Result: WinT3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed. Findings are validated on diverse datasets; code and model are publicly released.

Conclusion: The design choices (sliding window, compact camera representation, and a global camera token pool) improve online reconstruction quality without compromising efficiency, making WinT3R effective for real-time pose estimation and mapping.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

*Minjong Yoo,Woo Kyung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ICPAD enables rapid cross-domain adaptation of long-horizon, multi-task RL policies by learning diffusion-based prototype skills and a domain adapter offline, with dynamic prompting, achieving strong performance from limited target data in Metaworld and CARLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable data-efficient transfer of skill-based RL policies across diverse target domains under constraints (no model updates, limited data), addressing cross-domain differences in dynamics, embodiment, and task horizon.

Method: Propose cross-domain skill diffusion where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly from an offline dataset via cross-domain consistent diffusion. Prototype skills serve as universal primitives; a dynamic domain prompting scheme guides the skill adapter to align with the target domain.

Result: Experiments in robotic manipulation (Metaworld) and autonomous driving (CARLA) show ICPAD achieves superior policy adaptation under limited target-domain data across various cross-domain configurations.

Conclusion: ICPAD provides a data-efficient, diffusion-based mechanism for long-horizon, multi-task policy adaptation across domains, using prototype skills and a domain adapter with dynamic prompting to bridge domain gaps even with no updates to the target environment.

Abstract: In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework
designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imitation learning for spacecraft GNC using Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) achieves high performance with only 100 expert demonstrations (~6.3k env steps), producing smoother trajectories than a meta-RL baseline on ISS rendezvous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data requirements and improve sample efficiency for space docking control by leveraging imitation learning with transformer-based action chunking.

Method: Train ACT that maps visual and state observations to thrust/torque; uses action chunking and transformer architecture; compare to meta-RL trained with 40M interactions; evaluate on ISS docking scenario.

Result: ACT achieves greater accuracy, smoother control, and better sample efficiency than meta-RL baseline; requires far fewer interactions than the baseline.

Conclusion: ACT demonstrates that imitation learning with action chunking and transformers can deliver robust GNC performance under limited data, suitable for real-world space docking tasks.

Abstract: We present an imitation learning approach for spacecraft guidance,
navigation, and control(GNC) that achieves high performance from limited data.
Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment
interactions, our method, which implements Action Chunking with Transformers
(ACT), learns a control policy that maps visual and state observations to
thrust and torque commands. ACT generates smoother, more consistent
trajectories than a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) baseline trained with
40 million interactions. We evaluate ACT on a rendezvous task: in-orbit docking
with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

*Kallol Saha,Amber Li,Angela Rodriguez-Izquierdo,Lifan Yu,Ben Eisner,Maxim Likhachev,David Held*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPOT is a hybrid learning-and-planning approach for long-horizon manipulation that searches over point-cloud object transformations to transform an initial scene into a goal, using learned suggesters to sample actions and avoiding discretization; it performs well in multi-object rearrangement in simulation and reality and outperforms policy learning; ablations show search-based planning is beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete, symbolic task planning struggles with continuous, high-dimensional 3D manipulation; long horizons require modeling effects of sequences; hence need to combine learned priors with planning to guide search in continuous action spaces.

Method: Introduce SPOT: Search over Point cloud Object Transformations. Plan by searching a sequence of 3D transformations on the scene point cloud from initial to goal-satisfying. Use learned suggesters that operate on partially observed point clouds to propose candidate actions; avoid discretizing actions or object relationships.

Result: Evaluated on multi-object rearrangement tasks; reported task planning success and task execution success in both simulation and real-world, SPOT produces successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning baseline; ablations show the value of search-based planning.

Conclusion: Hybrid learning-and-planning can effectively handle long-horizon manipulation in continuous 3D spaces; search-based planning guided by learned priors yields robust planning and execution, reducing reliance on discretization.

Abstract: Long-horizon planning for robot manipulation is a challenging problem that
requires reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions on a physical 3D
scene. While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for
long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and
action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and
actions. Instead, we propose a hybrid learning-and-planning approach that
leverages learned models as domain-specific priors to guide search in
high-dimensional continuous action spaces. We introduce SPOT: Search over Point
cloud Object Transformations, which plans by searching for a sequence of
transformations from an initial scene point cloud to a goal-satisfying point
cloud. SPOT samples candidate actions from learned suggesters that operate on
partially observed point clouds, eliminating the need to discretize actions or
object relationships. We evaluate SPOT on multi-object rearrangement tasks,
reporting task planning success and task execution success in both simulation
and real-world environments. Our experiments show that SPOT generates
successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach. We also perform
ablations that highlight the importance of search-based planning.

*Manish Kansana,Sindhuja Penchala,Shahram Rahimi,Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Surformer v2 is a late-fusion, multimodal classifier that combines vision and tactile streams at the decision level for surface material classification, using an end-to-end model with an Efficient V-Net vision branch and an encoder-only transformer tactile branch, achieving competitive real-time performance on the Touch and Go dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance tactile-visual surface understanding in robotics by moving from handcrafted features with mid-level fusion to an end-to-end model that fuses modalities at the decision level and can adaptively weigh each modality during inference.

Method: Integrates feature extraction within the model. Vision uses a CNN-based classifier (Efficient V-Net); tactile uses an encoder-only transformer. Fusion occurs at the decision level by a learnable weighted sum of the two modality logits, rather than merging feature maps. The model is trained end-to-end and evaluated on the Touch and Go dataset (surface images with corresponding tactile readings).

Result: Surformer v2 demonstrates competitive inference speed suitable for real-time robotic applications and shows that decision-level fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling effectively enhance multi-modal surface understanding on the Touch and Go dataset.

Conclusion: Decision-level fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling improve multi-modal surface perception, yielding an efficient, end-to-end Surformer v2 architecture that is well-suited for real-time robotic perception tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal surface material classification plays a critical role in advancing
tactile perception for robotic manipulation and interaction. In this paper, we
present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture
designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a
late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1
framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by
mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer
v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts
to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient
V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model,
allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for
classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs
decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted
sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and
training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a
multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile
sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well,
maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic
applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level
fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface
understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.

*Zhihao Zhang,Chengyang Peng,Ekim Yurtsever,Keith A. Redmill*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid demonstration-guided reinforcement learning for autonomous driving: using a rule-based lane-change controller to guide SAC improves exploration and sample efficiency, boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL in automated driving often suffers from poor sample efficiency and exploration; leveraging demonstrations can stabilize and accelerate learning even when the demonstrator is not optimal.

Method: Integrate a rule-based lane-change controller as a demonstration policy with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The demonstration guides exploration and learning without requiring an expert-level controller; implemented in a driving environment to improve sample efficiency and learning speed.

Result: Demonstrates improved driving performance and faster convergence with better sample efficiency; the approach is applicable to other driving scenarios that can benefit from demonstration-based guidance.

Conclusion: Demonstration-based guidance using a rule-based controller with SAC offers a practical, extensible path to more efficient RL-based driving policies and can be extended to additional driving tasks.

Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted
significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through
environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in
sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an
optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL
driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized
or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change
controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration
and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance
and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from
demonstration-based guidance.

Conclusion: A computationally efficient hierarchical framework using reduced-order models achieves robust humanoid locomotion across diverse environments, with real-time performance validated on a commercially available humanoid platform.

Abstract: As humanoid robots enter real-world environments, ensuring robust locomotion
across diverse environments is crucial. This paper presents a computationally
efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on
reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm
and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use
the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over
step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP
trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the
standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate
the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step
planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human instructions are qualitative and can impose conditions that vary across tasks; existing batch-based methods struggle to adapt during execution, creating a gap for online, modifier-driven control in robot learning.

Method: Segment demonstrations into short sequences and assign weakly supervised labels corresponding to different modifier types; learn a mapping from modifier directives to actions; enable the robot to adjust motions online in response to directives during task execution.

Result: The method can adjust motions online in response to modifier directives during tasks like wiping and pick-and-place, outperforming conventional batch-based approaches that cannot adapt during execution.

Conclusion: Online adaptation to human modifier directives is feasible and effective for guiding robot actions in real-world tasks, improving responsiveness during execution.

Abstract: In the field of robot learning, coordinating robot actions through language
instructions is becoming increasingly feasible. However, adapting actions to
human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often
qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions.
This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in
response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral
conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from
modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short
sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific
modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks.
Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier
directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during
execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COMMET is a hybrid perception-and-preference framework for detecting and managing human-induced conflicts in home robot manipulation, using multi-modal retrieval plus fine-tuned inference, with GPT-4o-based preference aggregation, and a data-collection interface; preliminary results indicate the detection component outperforms GPT baselines in accuracy and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic and unpredictable human activities in daily life create conflicts with household robot actions, and user preferences are highly personal and non-unique; a personalized, user-centric approach is needed to safely and effectively integrate robots into everyday environments.

Method: A two-stage detection pipeline: (1) multi-modal retrieval to suggest potential conflicts, escalating to (2) fine-tuned model inference for low-confidence cases. The system collects user options/settings, and uses GPT-4o to summarize user preferences from relevant cases. A user-friendly data-collection interface and an effective deployment workflow are designed to support real-world use.

Result: Preliminary studies show the detection module achieves better accuracy and lower latency than GPT-model baselines. The work also delivers a data-collection interface and a demonstrated workflow for real-world deployments.

Conclusion: COMMET offers a promising approach for handling human-induced conflicts in household mobile manipulation, combining a hybrid detection pipeline with personalized preference summarization; future work should expand evaluations, datasets, and real-world deployment studies to validate generalizability and usability.

Abstract: Continuous advancements in robotics and AI are driving the integration of
robots from industry into everyday environments. However, dynamic and
unpredictable human activities in daily lives would directly or indirectly
conflict with robot actions. Besides, due to the social attributes of such
human-induced conflicts, solutions are not always unique and depend highly on
the user's personal preferences. To address these challenges and facilitate the
development of household robots, we propose COMMET, a system for human-induced
COnflicts in Mobile Manipulation of Everyday Tasks. COMMET employs a hybrid
detection approach, which begins with multi-modal retrieval and escalates to
fine-tuned model inference for low-confidence cases. Based on collected user
preferred options and settings, GPT-4o will be used to summarize user
preferences from relevant cases. In preliminary studies, our detection module
shows better accuracy and latency compared with GPT models. To facilitate
future research, we also design a user-friendly interface for user data
collection and demonstrate an effective workflow for real-world deployments.

*Chengkai Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Yicheng Guo,Peng Hang,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KDP combines diffusion-based action generation with sparse mixture-of-experts routing to achieve multi-modal, temporally coherent, and modular end-to-end autonomous driving, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end driving struggles with (1) producing diverse action modalities, (2) maintaining long-horizon temporal consistency, and (3) adapting knowledge across varied scenarios; existing methods often collapse modality, lack consistency, or are monolithic.

Method: A knowledge-driven diffusion policy (KDP) that fuses generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent, multi-modal action sequences; the sparse MoE routing activates specialized, reusable experts based on context, enabling modular knowledge composition. A Transformer backbone supports the architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios show that KDP achieves higher success rates, reduces collision risk, and provides smoother control compared to prevailing methods. Ablation studies confirm the importance of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone; activation analyses reveal structured expert specialization and cross-scenario reuse.

Conclusion: Diffusion with expert routing is a scalable, interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

### [63] [Towards an Accurate and Effective Robot Vision (The Problem of Topological Localization for Mobile Robots)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04948)
*Emanuela Boros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A systematic, quantitative comparison of appearance-based visual descriptors for topological localization from monocular images in an office environment, showing that proper descriptor configurations, similarity measures, and classifiers improve localization; validated on the ImageCLEF Robot Vision task; suggests future hierarchical/ranking approaches for real-time, illumination-robust localization across longer routes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological localization must cope with perceptual ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations, especially when relying on static images without temporal continuity; robust, scalable appearance-based methods are needed for reliable place recognition in office environments.

Method: Systematically evaluate state-of-the-art visual descriptors (Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT) and Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches, inspired by text retrieval. Analyze different distance measures and classifiers. Use standard evaluation metrics and visualizations to extend previous experiments. Validate configurations in the ImageCLEF Robot Vision task with novel image sequences.

Result: Findings indicate that appropriately configured appearance descriptors, distance measures, and classifiers yield advantages in localization accuracy. Quantitative metrics and visualizations support these conclusions, and the approach was validated in ImageCLEF Robot Vision, where the system correctly identified the most likely location for novel image sequences.

Conclusion: Future work includes hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature combinations to build more robust, scalable localization systems with reduced training and runtime, while mitigating the curse of dimensionality, aiming for integrated, real-time localization across varying illumination and longer routes.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

### [64] [Ground-Aware Octree-A* Hybrid Path Planning for Memory-Efficient 3D Navigation of Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04950)
*Byeong-Il Ham,Hyun-Bin Kim,Kyung-Soo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 3D path planner using octree-based maps and a height-aware cost to convert obstacles into navigational aids, delivering real-time, memory-efficient optimal paths by integrating A* with octree compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve 3D path planning for UGVs and legged robots under real-time and memory constraints while leveraging obstacles as potential navigational aids.

Method: Modify 3D A* with a height-based penalty in the cost function and use an octree-based 3D grid to compress space by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, enabling traversal of some obstacles and avoidance of impassable areas.

Result: Produces optimal paths while substantially reducing memory usage and computation time, enabling real-time path planning; benchmark results validate efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Octree-based 3D planning with height-aware cost maintains optimality while lowering memory and computation demands, supporting practical, real-time navigation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A*
algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged
robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of
terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only
as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A
modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles
during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the
cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid
locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more
efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves
compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in
obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes
explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and
memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments.
Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an
optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.

*Tien Pham,Xinyun Chi,Khang Nguyen,Manfred Huber,Angelo Cangelosi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DeGuV introduces a learnable depth-based masking module for visual RL that preserves essential information, combined with contrastive learning and Q-value stabilization to improve generalization and sample efficiency under data augmentation, achieving zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on RL-ViGen with a Franka robot and providing interpretable highlighted regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in visually-driven reinforcement learning is limited, especially under data augmentation, which can reduce sample efficiency and stability. There is a need for mechanisms that retain task-relevant visual information while enabling robust learning across environments.

Method: A learnable masker network generates a depth-driven mask to keep only critical visual cues, reducing irrelevant pixels. The approach integrates contrastive learning and augmentation-stabilized Q-value estimation. Evaluations are conducted on the RL-ViGen benchmark using a Franka Emika robot, focusing on zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and interpretability by visualizing salient regions.

Result: DeGuV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample efficiency on RL tasks and demonstrates zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. It also improves interpretability by highlighting the most relevant regions in the input.

Conclusion: DeGuV effectively enhances generalization and sample efficiency in visual RL through a depth-informed masking mechanism coupled with contrastive learning and stabilized value learning, enabling robust performance under augmentation and offering interpretable insights into salient visual features.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from
visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments
remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data
augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency
and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that
enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a
learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive
learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance
sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on
the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its
effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample
efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most
relevant regions in the visual input

TL;DR: Proposes a stability-guaranteed end-to-end deep learning controller for real-time robot kinematic control using a modular online weight-update scheme and Lyapunov-like stability analysis; validated on industrial robots; addresses the black-box issue and integrates DL with classical control theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time robotic control demands trustworthy, robust performance. Deep learning offers flexibility but lacks stability guarantees and interpretability (black-box nature). There is a need to bridge DL with established control theory to ensure stability while enabling real-time deployment.

Conclusion: A theoretical framework is established that harmonizes end-to-end deep learning control with traditional control theory, offering stability guarantees and practical viability for real-time robotic applications, and paving the way for broader adoption of DL-based control.

Abstract: Deep learning, with its exceptional learning capabilities and flexibility,
has been widely applied in various applications. However, its black-box nature
poses a significant challenge in real-time robotic applications, particularly
in robot control, where trustworthiness and robustness are critical in ensuring
safety. In robot motion control, it is essential to analyze and ensure system
stability, necessitating the establishment of methodologies that address this
need. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for end-to-end deep
learning control that can be integrated into existing robot control theories.
The proposed control algorithm leverages a modular learning approach to update
the weights of all layers in real time, ensuring system stability based on
Lyapunov-like analysis. Experimental results on industrial robots are presented
to illustrate the performance of the proposed deep learning controller. The
proposed method offers an effective solution to the black-box problem in deep
learning, demonstrating the possibility of deploying real-time deep learning

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLOWER is a 950M-parameter vision-language-action model that uses intermediate-modality fusion and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning to reduce compute, achieving strong performance across 190 tasks and SoTA on CALVIN ABC, pretrained in 200 GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the prohibitive computational costs and resource demands of diffusion-based VLA policies while preserving or improving performance and robustness across diverse tasks and embodiments.

Method: Two design strategies: (1) intermediate-modality fusion that prunes up to 50% of LLM layers to reallocate capacity to the diffusion head; (2) action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning enabling modular adaptation and reducing parameters by ~20%. Integrates these into a 950M VLA named FLOWER pretrained in 200 H100 GPU hours.

Result: FLOWER delivers competitive performance against larger VLAs across 190 tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks; robust to diverse robotic embodiments; achieves state-of-the-art 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark; demos, code, and pretrained weights released.

Conclusion: Efficient architectural design yields practical, high-performing VLA policies with substantially lower compute requirements, enabling scalable deployment in real-world robotics.

Abstract: Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for
practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive
computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA
policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve
strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions:
intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head
by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN
conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We
integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER.
Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance
with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world
benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In
addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

*Luca Müller,Hassan Ali,Philipp Allgeuer,Lukáš Gajdošech,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular MM-ITF model predicts the object a human intends to indicate in a tabletop HRI task by mapping 2D pointing gestures to object locations using inter-modality attention on monocular RGB data, with a patch confusion matrix for detailed evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to infer human intent from natural pointing gestures in human-robot interaction, using accessible monocular vision to guide attention toward the correct object.

Method: Introduce the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF), a modular architecture that uses inter-modality attention to fuse modalities and map 2D pointing gestures to candidate object locations, assigning likelihoods and selecting the most probable target. Evaluated in a controlled NICOL tabletop scenario where users point to objects; relies on monocular RGB input; includes a patch confusion matrix for diagnostic insights; code released.

Result: The approach accurately predicts the intended object from monocular RGB data, enabling intuitive HRI. The patch confusion matrix provides detailed insights into prediction performance across candidate locations.

Conclusion: MM-ITF demonstrates effective, accessible hand-gesture–driven object targeting in HRI using simple vision, highlighting its potential for robust human-robot collaboration and pointing toward future work on robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

*Cristiano Caissutti,Estelle Gerbier,Ehsan Khorrambakht,Paolo Marinelli,Andrea Munafo',Andrea Caiti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular, multi-layer shared autonomy framework for marine robotics that combines LLM-based task specification, intent-aware human-in-the-loop coordination, and a Behavior-Tree Mission Manager; preliminarily validated in simulations and lake-like tests, showing reduced cognitive load, increased transparency, and better alignment with human intent; ongoing port-scenario validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high risk, uncertainty, and cognitive burden in maritime operations by enabling intuitive task specification, adaptable multi-agent coordination, and interpretable mission control in a scalable, trustworthy architecture.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (i) integrate LLMs for high-level task specification and hull inspection missions; (ii) implement human-in-the-loop coordination in multi-agent fleets to enable adaptive, intent-aware collaboration; (iii) develop a modular Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable, flexible control; plus simulation and real-world lake-like experiments to test the architecture.

Result: Preliminary results indicate reduced operator cognitive load, greater transparency, and improved alignment of autonomous behavior with human intent; the architecture shows promise for adaptive coordination across heterogeneous marine robots.

Conclusion: The work lays a modular, scalable foundation for trustworthy, human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics; ongoing effort to integrate components and validate in operational port scenarios.

Abstract: Shared autonomy is a promising paradigm in robotic systems, particularly
within the maritime domain, where complex, high-risk, and uncertain
environments necessitate effective human-robot collaboration. This paper
investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance
shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task
specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of
human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable
adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular
Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible
mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like
environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to
reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive
behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully
integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating
the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to
establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy,
human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.

*Nariman Niknejad,Gokul S. Sankar,Bahare Kiumarsi,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a perception-aware robust MPC that handles non-Gaussian, biased, heavy-tailed perception noise via constrained zonotopes; reformulates to LP; ensures stability with Minkowski-Lyapunov frameworks; demonstrated on a ROS2-enabled omnidirectional robot with CNN perception; outperforms Gaussian-noise MPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification of deep perception modules is crucial for safe control; Gaussian-noise assumptions fail under heavy-tailed biases; need set-based estimation to capture non-Gaussian uncertainty.

Method: Set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes; robust MPC reformulated as linear program using Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost and slack variable; derive largest stabilizing terminal set and feedback gain using ellipsoidal approximation of zonotopes; ensure closed-loop stability via Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic invariant sets; implemented in ROS2 with CNN perception.

Result: Simulation and hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot with camera and CNN perception; results show stable, accurate control under heavy-tailed noise; significant improvement in state estimation error bounds and control performance over Gaussian-noise-based designs.

Conclusion: Perception-aware MPC with constrained zonotope-based uncertainty gives robust performance under non-Gaussian perception noise; feasible computationally via LP; broad applicability to perception-driven robotic control.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise as decision-support in CPM but struggle with nuanced ethical reasoning and accountability; robust human-in-the-loop governance is needed; introduces EDSAC for evaluating ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become decision-support tools in high-risk construction project management, there is a need to assess their ethical reasoning, reliability, and governance to avoid autonomous unethical decisions.

Method: Mixed-methods: quantitative evaluation of two leading LLMs on twelve real-world ethical scenarios using the Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC); qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional perceptions.

Result: LLMs perform adequately in structured domains like legal compliance but lag in contextual nuance, accountability, and transparent reasoning; stakeholders favor human-in-the-loop; EDSAC offers a replicable evaluation methodology; LLMs are best used as decision-support aids rather than autonomous ethical agents.

Conclusion: Practically, integrate LLMs with governance structures that ensure human oversight, transparency, and accountability; avoid autonomous ethical judgments in CPM; further empirical work is needed to refine evaluation tools and governance frameworks.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

### [72] [Maestro: Joint Graph & Config Optimization for Reliable AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04642)
*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro jointly optimizes the agent graph and per-node configurations to improve LLM agent quality under rollout budgets, using reflective trace-based feedback to guide edits; it outperforms prompt-only optimizers on standard benchmarks with fewer rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimizers tune configurations while keeping the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. There is a need to address both graph topology and node settings to enhance reliability and efficiency of LLM agents.

Method: Maestro is a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer that searches over graphs and configurations, enforces rollout/token budgets, and uses reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits; it effectively explores the joint search space to improve agent quality.

Result: On IFBench and HotpotQA, Maestro surpasses MIPROv2, GEPA, GEPA+Merge by averages of about 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only optimization, it still leads by about 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%; achieves these with far fewer rollouts; shows large gains on interviewer and RAG agents.

Conclusion: Joint graph and configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix; Maestro is framework-agnostic and more sample-efficient, with robust gains across benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

*Philippe J. Giabbanelli,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A proposed mixed-methods framework to tailor LLM-generated explanations of health simulations to diverse stakeholders, using stakeholder elicitation, controllable output tuning, and multi-metric evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the explanatory gap: complex health simulations (M&S) are underutilized because explanations are not tailored to varied stakeholders’ informational needs. One-size-fits-all summaries fail for clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers, and health advocates.

Method: A step-by-step, mixed-methods approach: (1) elicit explanation needs and stylistic preferences from diverse health stakeholders; (2) optimize LLMs to generate tailored outputs via controllable attribute tuning; (3) evaluate using a comprehensive set of metrics to iteratively improve tailored summaries.

Result: Proposes a concrete framework and workflow for identifying stakeholder needs and generating tailored explanations of health simulations using LLMs; outlines an evaluation plan.

Conclusion: Addresses a critical gap in translating M&S outputs to practice by customizing explanations; sets the stage for empirical validation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks may miss nuanced AI capabilities and human-like reasoning; need human-centered criteria to better evaluate interpretability and applicability.

Method: Conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify cognitive skills (Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, Contextualizing) and integrated these insights into benchmark design.

Result: Offers a framework for human-aligned benchmarking with actionable guidelines to redefine progress measurements and enhance interpretability and applicability of AI models.

Conclusion: User-centered evaluation is crucial for AI development and can shape future progress in model evaluation.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

### [75] [Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conceptual proposal for hierarchical, language-driven World Models to guide multi-agent learning, using LLM-generated scaffolds to create explicit task layers that improve sample efficiency and long-horizon strategic play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit, hierarchical World Models are a key bottleneck for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. Current approaches struggle with exploration in high-fidelity yet structurally flat simulators and sparse rewards (e.g., robotic soccer). A language-configurable World Model can supply intrinsic curriculum, dense learning signals, and compositional structure to bridge low-level behavior and high-level coordination.

Method: Advocate hierarchical scaffolding to decompose goals into subgoals, synthesize evidence from a 2024 systematic review of multi-agent soccer showing a shift toward symbolic and hierarchical methods within MARL, and propose using Large Language Models to dynamically generate the hierarchical scaffold. The environment is designed with language-configurable task layers, making the World Model explicit and task-driven to guide learning.

Result: As a position paper, it presents a conceptual framework and anticipated benefits rather than empirical results. It argues for improved sample efficiency, richer learning signals, and better integration of strategic team play, with future work needed to validate the approach experimentally.

Conclusion: Language-driven, hierarchical World Models offer a path to unify Language, Agent, and World Models, enabling scalable, generalizable, long-horizon multi-agent intelligence. Building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers is proposed to operationalize this vision.

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Motivation: LLMs are strong at reactive information processing but struggle with exploring hypothetical futures and forecasting consequences before acting. This limitation hinders performance in dynamic, high-stakes tasks (strategic planning, risk assessment, real-time decision making).

Method: Introduce What-If Analysis (WIA) into LLMs by systematically varying input variables and simulating potential actions. Use reinforcement learning to incorporate environmental feedback and dynamically simulate outcomes of actions, enabling anticipation of future states rather than reacting to present conditions. Validate in Honor of Kings (HoK), a fast-changing multiplayer game with complex interactions, as a testbed for multi-step consequence prediction.

Result: WiA-LLM achieves 74.2% accuracy in forecasting game-state changes, with up to ~2x improvements over baselines. Notable gains in high-difficulty scenarios requiring precise foresight.

Conclusion: This work is the first to formalize and integrate what-if analysis within LLMs, marking a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning and scalable, robust decision-making in dynamic environments with broad strategic implications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

### [77] [TalkToAgent: A Human-centric Explanation of Reinforcement Learning Agents with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04809)
*Haechang Kim,Hao Chen,Can Li,Jong Min Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TalkToAgent is a five-LLM-agent framework that translates user questions about RL policies into XRL tasks and provides interpretable explanations, including counterfactuals; validated on a nonlinear control benchmark with high task-mapping accuracy and improved counterfactual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts due to limited comprehensibility and fragmented XRL tools; there is a need for interactive, natural-language explanations that integrate various XRL tools.

Method: Five specialized LLMs (Coordinator, Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, Debugger) automatically map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms of key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual explanations. The approach extends previous counterfactuals by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral descriptions or new rule-based policies. Validation was conducted on the quadruple-tank process control benchmark.

Result: TalkToAgent achieved high accuracy in mapping user queries to XRL tasks; coder-debugger interactions minimized failures in counterfactual generation; qualitative evaluation confirmed effective interpretation and contextualization of the agent's actions within the problem domain.

Conclusion: TalkToAgent provides an interactive, natural-language explanation framework for RL policies, bridging the gap between complex policies and domain experts, with demonstrated effectiveness on a nonlinear control benchmark.

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

*Mukul Singh,Arjun Radhakrishna,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models can rival or exceed top classical strategies in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma, exhibiting cooperative traits (niceness, generosity) and rapid adaptation to opponent shifts, signaling meaningful long-horizon behavior in multi-agent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language-model agents behave over long horizons in cooperative/competitive multi-agent contexts, bridging a gap in prior work focused on short-term or isolated interactions and informing their role in mixed human-AI environments.

Method: Evaluate language-model-based agents against a suite of 240 established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style IPD tournament; analyze cooperative traits (niceness, provocability, generosity); conduct strategy-switch experiments to test rapid adaptation to opponent changes.

Result: Language-model agents achieve performance on par with, and sometimes exceeding, the best-known classical strategies; they display cooperative traits (niceness, provocability, generosity) and adapt rapidly to mid-game shifts in opponent strategy, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic characterization of long-term cooperative behaviors in language-model agents and lays groundwork for deploying such agents in complex, mixed human-AI social environments.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

*Krittanon Kaewtawee,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Clones a conversational voice AI agent from call recordings to emulate top agents; performs well on routine call tasks but struggles with persuasion/objection handling, evaluated against human agents across 22 criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and scale customer service and healthcare voice interactions, reducing costs while maintaining quality, by reproducing effective human agent behaviors from transcripts.

Method: Domain selection (telesales); knowledge extraction and prompt engineering from transcripts; integrated streaming pipeline: ASR + LLM dialogue manager + TTS; learns playbooks from top agents; evaluation on 22 criteria including intro, product communication, sales drive, objections, closing; blind tests.

Result: AI agent approaches human performance on routine aspects of calls; underperforms in persuasion/objection handling; prompts refined; design lessons and future research avenues (large-scale simulation, automated evaluation).

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of cloning conversational voice agents from call data; highlights limitations and areas for improvement; offers a generalizable framework for other domains with transcripts.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Xiaofei Sun,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSC introduces a knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration layer for LLM-based multi-agent systems, using Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKMs) to monitor collaborators' cognitive states and adapt communication, significantly boosting task performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work mainly targets agent selection and result aggregation but lacks a robust intermediate layer for deep linguistic collaboration; there is a need for real-time perception of collaborators' cognitive states to bridge selection and aggregation and improve coordination.

Method: Proposes Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKMs) that enable each agent to perceive collaborators' cognitive states; real-time cognitive gap analysis; adaptive communication strategies (content focus, detail level, expression style) learned over time; operates as an intermediate layer between selection and aggregation.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks show improved task performance and communication efficiency, converting «parallel-working» individuals into a deeply collaborative cognitive team.

Conclusion: OSC provides a practical framework for knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLM systems and offers new insights into agent interaction strategies and communication dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

### [81] [SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04908)
*Hongyi Jing,Jiafu Chen,Chen Rao,Ziqiang Dang,Jiajie Teng,Tianyi Chu,Juncheng Mo,Shuo Fang,Huaizhong Lin,Rui Lv,Chenguang Ma,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser proposes an end-to-end GUI parsing framework that switches from discrete, autoregressive coordinate modeling to continuous coordinate modeling within a pre-trained MLLM, enabling higher localization precision and full-interface parsing. It adds a token router and coordinate decoder, plus a rejection mechanism via a modified Hungarian matching algorithm, and introduces ScreenParse as a benchmarking suite; experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models for GUI perception rely on discrete, text-autoregressive coordinates, which hurts grounding accuracy, is slow, and can only locate predefined elements. There is a need for end-to-end continuous localization and comprehensive interface parsing to enable broader downstream tasks and robustness.

Method: SparkUI-Parser employs continuous coordinate modeling based on a pre-trained MLLM, augmented with a token router and a coordinate decoder. It abandons probability-based discrete outputs in favor of continuous coordinates, and introduces a rejection mechanism using a modified Hungarian matching algorithm to filter non-existent elements. It also presents ScreenParse, a benchmark to systematically assess GUI structural perception.

Result: Empirical results show the approach consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding, and ScreenParse benchmarks, indicating improved localization precision, parsing capability, and robustness. The framework also offers faster inference and reduced false positives due to the rejection mechanism.

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser delivers an end-to-end GUI parsing solution with continuous localization and full-interface parsing, supported by a new benchmark (ScreenParse). The work demonstrates solid performance gains over existing methods and provides open resources at the project repository.

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

*Barbara Gendron,Gaël Guibon,Mathieu D'aquin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An ontology-based framework converts qualitative conversational features into quantitative definitions, enabling CEFR-based proficiency control in LLMs via description logic and ontology-guided fine-tuning; experiments show improved transparency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllability of large language models in conversational agents is challenging due to qualitative, qualitative-features that are hard to formalize. There is a need for formal, explainable mechanisms to ensure predictable and user-personalized responses; CEFR-level control is used as a representative case.

Method: Derive quantitative definitions from linguistic descriptors, formalize them in description logic, and integrate them into an ontology. Use the ontology to guide controlled text generation by fine-tuning the LLM. Apply the framework to CEFR language proficiency levels as a case study and evaluate.

Result: The approach yields consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI. Experimental results support the efficacy of ontology-based, logic-guided control.

Conclusion: An ontology- and description-logic-based control framework improves predictability and transparency of LLM-driven conversations; the approach is generalizable to other qualitative conversational features and enables reasoning and consistency checks during generation.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes DOVIS, a five-layer protocol for privacy-preserving aggregation of usage and performance signals, and AgentRank-UC, a dynamic ranking algorithm that merges usage and competence. Supported by simulations and theory showing convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance, aimed at enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable ranking of reasoning-capable LLM agents in a Web of Agents, addressing fragmented and private usage signals that prevent global ranking (unlike PageRank). The goal is to design a privacy-preserving, incentive-compatible protocol that aggregates signals across an ecosystem to support trustworthy agent selection at scale.

Method: Introduce DOVIS (Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics) as a five-layer protocol to collect minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and performance. Implement AgentRank-UC, a dynamic, trust-aware ranking that fuses usage (selection frequency) and competence (outcome quality, cost, safety, latency). Provide simulations and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance.

Result: Simulation studies and formal analysis indicate that the proposed protocol and ranking method can converge to trustworthy agent rankings, are robust to perturbations, and resist Sybil-like manipulation, demonstrating viability of coordinated, performance-aware ranking in an Agentic Web.

Conclusion: The work provides a viable blueprint for building a scalable, trustworthy Web of Agents through a standardized, privacy-preserving data-collection substrate and a combined usage- and competence-based ranking mechanism; further work likely needed to validate in real ecosystems and address practical deployment challenges.

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

*Jie Chen,Jinhao Jiang,Yingqian Min,Zican Dong,Shijie Wang,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS introduces a test-time scaling framework that coordinates three collaborative large reasoning models (LRMs) guided by distilled "stickers"—key conditions that extract, refine, and reuse information across reasoning rounds. It employs a two-stage optimization (imitation learning + self-improvement) to progressively refine solutions. Evaluations on AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH show Sticker-TTS consistently beating strong baselines under similar inference budgets. Code and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods largely rely on redundant sampling and fail to leverage historical reasoning attempts. There is a need to improve computational efficiency and solution quality by reusing historical experiences during inference, especially for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: Three collaborative LRMs iteratively explore and refine solutions, guided by historical attempts. The core concept is 'stickers'—distilled conditions that drive extraction, refinement, and reuse of critical information across rounds. A two-stage optimization combines imitation learning (to bootstrap behavior) with self-improvement (progressive refinement) to enhance performance and efficiency during inference.

Result: Empirical evaluations on AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently outperforms strong baselines, including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under comparable inference budgets.

Conclusion: Sticker-guided utilization of historical experience effectively improves test-time reasoning efficiency and accuracy. The approach highlights the value of distilled 'stickers' for cross-round information reuse, supported by a beneficial two-stage optimization strategy. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

TL;DR: Proposes Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs) as abstracted, interconnected representations of functional elements to enable problem reframing and analogical inspiration; introduces MUSE, an algorithm that uses FCGs to generate creative ideas; demonstrates on a 500k-patent dataset and releases the graph for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Innovators tend to fixate on existing solutions or nascent ideas, hindering exploration of novel alternatives. There is a need for explicit, large-scale abstractions and reliable inspiration mechanisms. Prior work lacks high-quality, interpretable graphs with clear abstraction relations and scalable resources.

TL;DR: ProToM provides theory-of-mind-informed, context-aware feedback to promote prosocial actions in multi-agent settings, outperforming LLM baselines in two environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To promote cooperation by guiding individual agents' actions with targeted feedback when pursuing independent goals.

Method: Infer agents' goals via Bayesian inverse planning; select feedback by maximizing expected utility given inferred goal distribution; evaluate against baselines in Doors, Keys, and Gems and Overcooked.

Result: ProToM achieves higher success rates, faster task completion, and is preferred by humans; LLM-based feedback is less contextually grounded and requires more communication overhead.

Conclusion: A ToM-informed feedback mechanism can effectively steer prosocial behavior in multi-agent systems, offering improvements over standard LLM-mediated feedback and suggesting directions for scalable, context-aware communication.

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a simple query-answering-based formal semantics for ODRL aligned with spec 2.2 and uses it to formalize policy comparison (equivalence, more/less restrictive).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL is the de facto standard for digital rights management, but there is no comprehensive formal semantics. A rigorous semantics is needed to evaluate and compare policies, especially for data-sharing scenarios.

Method: Develops a query-answering-based formal semantics that refines prior formalisations and aligns with the ODRL 2.2 specification; builds an evaluation semantics and uses it to study policy comparison.

Result: Provides a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL and defines/studies the problem of comparing two policies, including detecting equivalence and whether one is more restrictive or permissive.

Conclusion: The proposed semantics and policy-comparison framework offer a rigorous basis for evaluating and comparing ODRL policies and refine earlier formalisms in line with the official spec.

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

TL;DR: A framework called LatticeWorld generates large-scale, interactive 3D environments from textual and visual prompts using LLMs and Unreal Engine 5, achieving high scene fidelity and much faster production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To narrow the sim-to-real gap and accelerate realistic 3D world creation for applications like embodied AI, autonomous driving, and entertainment by automating the production pipeline.

Method: Use lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) and an industry rendering engine (Unreal Engine 5) to convert multimodal inputs into dynamic 3D worlds with agents, physics, and real-time rendering; evaluate scene layout accuracy, visual fidelity, and production efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates superior accuracy in scene layout and visuals; reports over 90x gains in industrial production efficiency while maintaining creative quality, with a demo video.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld shows potential as an efficient, scalable 3D world-generation workflow that leverages LLM guidance and high-end rendering to reduce manual modeling effort and the sim-to-real gap; future work could expand realism, dynamics, and multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal

### [89] [Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536)
*Oliver Dunn,Koorosh Aslansefat,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SafeML: a quantum-focused safety monitoring approach for QML that adapts SafeML with quantum-state distance metrics to detect drift and provide confidence in QML decisions, enabling human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety gaps in quantum machine learning (QML) due to its fundamental differences from classical ML and the lack of established safety mechanisms for quantum models.

Method: Adapt SafeML by introducing quantum-centric distance measures defined over quantum state spaces; implement a model-dependent, post-classification evaluation to compare operational outputs with training data and detect concept drift in QML models (e.g., QCNN and VQC).

Result: Experiments on QCNN and VQC models demonstrate that Q-SafeML enables informed human oversight and enhances transparency and safety by quantifying drift/uncertainty in QML outputs.

Conclusion: Q-SafeML extends SafeML to quantum settings, addressing quantum-specific representational constraints with appropriate distance metrics and a model-dependent evaluation approach to improve safety in QML systems.

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

### [90] [Finance-Grounded Optimization For Algorithmic Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04541)
*Kasymkhan Khubiev,Mikhail Semenov,Irina Podlipnova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes loss functions grounded in finance metrics (Sharpe, PnL, Max Drawdown) plus turnover regularization to constrain trading positions; shows these outperform standard MSE for return prediction in algorithmic trading tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance requires interpretable AI and objective functions aligned with trading performance and risk controls; standard losses (e.g., MSE) may not capture finance-specific objectives or constraints.

Method: Derives loss functions from key quantitative finance metrics (Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss, Maximum Drawdown) and introduces turnover regularization to cap position changes. Evaluates on return prediction for trading strategies, comparing against mean squared error.

Result: Financially grounded loss functions with turnover regularization outperform traditional MSE for return prediction tasks when evaluated with algorithmic trading metrics; improvements seen in trading strategy performance and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: Aligning loss objectives with finance-specific metrics and adding turnover constraints can enhance predictive performance and interpretability for trading applications; suggests broader adoption and further research into finance-aligned AI losses.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [92] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExIt is a family of autocurriculum RL methods that enables inference-time multi-step self-improvement in LLMs by training on single informative steps and expanding task space via selective sampling of informative intermediate histories; with optional exploration to diversify tasks, it demonstrates strong self-improvement across math, tool use, and ML engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fixed maximum iteration depth in self-improvement tasks and costly training of long trajectories, by leveraging the recurrent structure to train on the most informative single-step iterations and grow the task space through intermediate histories.

Method: ExIt selects the most informative intermediate partial histories encountered during an episode to create new self-iteration task instances and trains a self-improvement policy on these; can pair with explicit exploration to maintain diversity; trained from one or multiple task instances.

Result: Policy learned via ExIt shows inference-time self-improvement on held-out tasks and can iteratively reach higher performance within a budget beyond the depth seen during training, across domains like competition math, multi-turn tool use, and ML engineering.

Conclusion: ExIt successfully exploits the recurrent nature of self-improvement tasks to enable efficient, scalable training for multi-step self-improvement at inference-time, with broader applicability across domains and enhancement through exploration.

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

### [93] [Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583)
*Jiequn Han,Kui Ren,Nathan Soedjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An instance-wise adaptive sampling framework tailors training data to each test instance to improve sample efficiency in inverse problems, demonstrated on inverse scattering with structured priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data collection costs and achieve high-accuracy inverse problem solutions by focusing training data around the test instance, rather than relying on a fixed, high-dimensional prior dataset.

Method: Iteratively refine the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, allocating sampling effort based on the specific test instance to adapt to the local geometry of the inverse map around that instance, demonstrated in inverse scattering with two structured priors.

Result: Significant gains in sample efficiency, especially with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements; the adaptive approach outperforms fixed-dataset training and is scalable and broadly applicable to inverse problems.

Conclusion: Instance-wise adaptive sampling offers a practical, scalable alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training for inverse problems, with stronger benefits under challenging priors and accuracy demands.

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

*Han Zhang,Fengji Ma,Jiamin Su,Xinyue Yang,Lei Wang,Wen-Cai Ye,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-enhanced, task-weighted multi-task learning framework (QW-MTL) for ADMET classification that uses quantum descriptors and exponential task weighting to jointly train 13 TDC benchmarks, outperforming single-task models on 12 of 13.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STL models underutilize cross-task complementarities and require substantial resources; a unified multi-task approach with adaptive loss balancing is desirable to improve predictive performance and efficiency in ADMET classification.

Method: QW-MTL extends the Chemprop-RDKit backbone with quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations; introduces an exponential task weighting scheme that blends dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters for dynamic loss balancing across tasks; trained jointly on all 13 Therapeutics Data Commons benchmarks using leaderboard-style splits.

Result: Significant improvement over single-task baselines on 12 of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with minimal model complexity and fast inference.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed features and adaptive task weighting; first to systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 TDC benchmarks.

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

### [96] [Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a separability-based framework to compare representational similarity metrics across model families; finds soft-matching most separable and RSA still strong, guiding metric choice for brain/model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representational similarity metrics are widely used, but there is no systematic assessment of their discriminative power across diverse model families and training regimes; a separability lens is needed to guide metric selection.

Method: Evaluate mapping-based and non-fitting similarity metrics (RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, soft matching) using three separability measures (d', silhouette, ROC-AUC). Compare CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt under supervised and self-supervised training.

Result: Separability increases with stricter alignment constraints; soft-matching achieves highest separability, followed by Procrustes and linear predictivity; RSA also yields strong separability across families.

Conclusion: First systematic separability-based comparison of similarity metrics; clarifies sensitivity and helps choose metrics for large-scale brain-model comparisons.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

### [97] [Split Conformal Prediction in the Function Space with Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04623)
*David Millard,Lars Lindemann,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends split conformal prediction to function-valued outputs by discretizing the output space, obtaining finite-sample guarantees on a grid and lifting them to function space as discretization refines; introduces a decomposition of the conformal radius, a regression-based calibration transfer across resolutions, two diagnostics, and empirical evidence of calibrated coverage robust to resolution shifts and improved super-resolution coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators in infinite dimensions lacks finite-sample coverage guarantees. Existing methods rely on strong assumptions or yield conservative coverage.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) discretize outputs and apply split conformal prediction to obtain finite-sample coverage in finite dimensions; (2) let discretization refine and lift guarantees to function space; decompose conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and misspecification; apply regression-based correction to transfer calibration across resolutions; introduce two diagnostics (conformal ensemble score, internal agreement) for autoregressive forecasts.

Result: Empirical results show calibrated coverage with reduced sensitivity to resolution shifts and improved coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional discretizations and a principled asymptotic transfer to function spaces, with practical diagnostics and robust performance across resolutions.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

### [98] [Fundamental bounds on efficiency-confidence trade-off for transductive conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04631)
*Arash Behboodi,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transductive conformal prediction entails a fundamental trade-off between confidence and efficiency: achieving non-trivial confidence causes prediction sets to grow exponentially with sample size, with the growth rate tied to conditional entropy and a dispersion term; an idealized setting attains the bound, and a special case connects to hypothesis testing with asymptotically optimal predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify the efficiency limits and cost of confidence in transductive conformal prediction, and understand how the prediction-set size scales with certainty requirements.

Method: Derives a strict finite-sample bound on the size of prediction sets for transductive conformal prediction, introduces a second-order dispersion term (variance of log conditional probabilities), shows the exponent scales linearly with the number of samples and with conditional entropy, demonstrates achievability in an idealized setting, and analyzes a special case where all test points share the same label.

Result: The bound shows that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth of prediction-set size in the number of samples, with the exponent equal to the conditional entropy and a dispersion term; the bound is shown to be achievable in an idealized scenario. In the special case where all test data share the same label, the problem reduces to hypothesis testing with empirically observed statistics and yields an asymptotically optimal confidence predictor and explicit error-exponent analysis.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental trade-off between confidence and efficiency in transductive conformal prediction. The derived bound characterizes the cost of confidence and is achievable in idealized settings. The equal-label special case connects to optimal hypothesis testing, offering an asymptotically optimal predictor and clear error-exponent behavior.

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

### [99] [Interpreting Transformer Architectures as Implicit Multinomial Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04653)
*Jonas A. Actor,Anthony Gruber,Eric C. Cyr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper links attention dynamics to multinomial regression, showing that optimizing latent features in a fixed multinomial regression yields optima that align with the trajectory of transformer attention, i.e., attention-induced dynamics recover optimal classification features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify attention and align mechanistic interpretability with classical statistical estimation, addressing questions about polysemanticity, superposition, and how attention relates to model performance.

Method: The authors analyze a fixed multinomial regression setting and prove that optimizing over latent features yields solutions that align with the dynamics induced by attention blocks in transformers; conceptually, the representation evolution through a transformer constitutes a trajectory that recovers optimal classification features.

Result: Transformer representations evolve along a trajectory that recovers the optimal features for classification in the latent-feature space; attention mechanisms implement the optimization dynamics that converge to these optima.

Conclusion: A novel theoretical bridge between attention and multinomial regression reframing attention as an optimization-driven feature-recovery process, with implications for interpretability and possibly informing model design.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

*Yuhan Helena Liu,Victor Geadah,Jonathan Pillow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible, nonparametric framework to infer learning rules from de novo animal learning data using deep networks, including a recurrent variant, showing non-Markovian, asymmetric updates and improved predictive power on mice behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer biological learning rules directly from behavior in de novo learning tasks, overcoming parametric constraints (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradients) and limited settings (bandits) to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich stimulus integration.

Method: A nonparametric per-trial update model that uses a deep neural network to specify policy-weight updates; extended to a recurrent version (RNN) to incorporate trial history and non-Markovian dynamics; validated on simulated data and applied to a large mouse decision-making dataset over weeks.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy on held-out data; inferred learning-rule properties include asymmetric updates after correct vs error trials and history dependence, indicating non-Markovian learning.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible framework for inferring biological learning rules from de novo behavioral data, with potential to inform experimental training protocols and the development of behavioral digital twins.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

### [101] [Beyond Ordinary Lipschitz Constraints: Differentially Private Stochastic Optimization with Tsybakov Noise Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04668)
*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SCO under Tsybakov Noise Condition with gradient moment bounds yields privacy-preserving algorithms whose utility rates do not depend on the Lipshitz constant; provides Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz results, and matching lower bounds under rho-zero CDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In stochastic convex optimization with differential privacy, the conventional assumption of a bounded Lipschitz constant can be too restrictive when losses are highly non-smooth or have very large constants. Introducing the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with parameter θ>1, together with bounded k-th moment of the gradient (k≥2), enables robust rates that depend on gradient moments rather than Lipschitz constants.

Method: Design an (ε,δ)-DP algorithm leveraging gradient clipping and moment-based gradient estimates to control sensitivity. Derive high-probability utility bounds that isolate the impact of the gradient’s 2k-th or k-th moments (tilde r_{2k}, tilde r_k). First handle the Lipschitz regime with θ≥2, producing rate bounds that are independent of the Lipschitz constant. Extend to θ≥θ̄ (known) for general TNC strength. For small ε, obtain bounds that apply even when the loss is not Lipschitz. Establish a private minimax lower bound under ρ-zero CDP.

Result: Main upper bounds: (i) Lipschitz case with θ≥2: utility ≤ tilde O( ( tilde r_{2k} (1/√n + √d/(n ε))^{(k-1)/k} )^{ θ/(θ-1) } ). (ii) General θ≥θ̄: utility ≤ tilde O( ( tilde r_k (1/√n + √d/(n ε))^{(k-1)/k} )^{ θ/(θ-1) } ). (iii) When ε is small: a bound of the form tilde O( ( tilde r_k (1/√n + √d/(n ε))^{(k-1)/k} )^{ θ/(θ-1)} ) even if the loss is not Lipschitz. Lower bounds: for any θ≥2, private minimax rate under ρ-zero CDP is Ω( ( tilde r_k (1/√n + √d/(n√ρ))^{(k-1)/k} )^{ θ/(θ-1) } ).

Conclusion: The work delivers DP-SCO methods under TNC with gradient moment constraints that achieve near-optimal rates independent of the (potentially huge) Lipschitz constant. It extends to known θ̄ and non-Lipschitz losses in the small-ε regime and matches a corresponding lower bound under ρ-zero CDP, highlighting a regime where privacy-noise trade-offs can be balanced via gradient-moment control rather than Lipschitz bounds. Potential future work includes tightening constants, extending to other DP notions, and exploring unknown θ or adaptive procedures.

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that

### [102] [Echoes Before Collapse: Deep Learning Detection of Flickering in Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04683)
*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNN-LSTM models trained on synthetic noisy polynomial time series can detect flickering (noise-driven switching) and generalize to real-world data, offering an early warning framework for regime shifts across diverse systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flickering signals reduced resilience and can precede critical regime shifts; detecting it in noisy nonlinear time series across climate, ecosystems, and finance is valuable but challenging.

Method: Generate synthetic time series from simple polynomial dynamics with additive noise; train CNN-LSTM to classify flickering; test generalization on other stochastic systems; apply to empirical datasets (dormouse body temperature; African Humid Period proxies).

Result: CNN-LSTM accurately identifies flickering in synthetic data; generalizes to diverse stochastic systems; detects flickering in empirical datasets.

Conclusion: Deep learning provides a flexible framework to extract early warning signals from noisy nonlinear time series and identify instability across dynamical systems; broad applicability across domains despite simplified training data.

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

### [103] [KRAFT: A Knowledge Graph-Based Framework for Automated Map Conflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04684)
*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAFT is a learning-based map conflation system that constructs knowledge graphs from GDBs, aligns them for map matching, and merges matched entities via MILP to produce consistent, enriched geospatial databases with superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing map conflation methods are limited to linear objects and rely on heuristic, rule-based approaches. There is a need for a data-driven method that can handle non-linear entities and learn entity matching.

Method: 1) Knowledge Graph Construction: represent each GDB as a knowledge graph. 2) Map Matching: apply knowledge graph alignment and a geospatial feature encoder to match entities across graphs. 3) Map Merging: integrate the matched entities using a mixed integer linear programming formulation to ensure a consistent, conflict-free merge.

Result: KRAFT achieves outstanding performance compared with state-of-the-art and baselines on map conflation tasks; its Map Matching and Map Merging modules also outperform traditional methods individually.

Conclusion: A learning-based, KG-centric framework can effectively perform map conflation across diverse entity types, producing accurate, complete GDBs without inconsistencies.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

*Wenhui Cui,Christopher Sandino,Hadi Pouransari,Ran Liu,Juri Minxha,Ellen L. Zippi,Aman Verma,Anna Sedlackova,Behrooz Mahasseni,Erdrin Azemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) aligns EMG with pose representations to improve gesture classification, enabling zero-shot; outperforms emg2pose by up to 21% ID and 72% OOD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage low-power sEMG signals from wearables for continuous gesture prediction by learning representations that align with high-quality, structured data (pose) to enhance representation quality and enable zero-shot classification.

Method: Introduce CPEP framework; train an EMG encoder to produce pose-informative representations by contrastively aligning EMG and pose representations; use linear probing and zero-shot evaluation; compare with emg2pose baseline.

Result: CPEP yields improved gesture classification; gains up to 21% in-distribution and 72% out-of-distribution over emg2pose.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of cross-modality representation learning between weak EMG and pose data to boost performance and enable zero-shot gestures; suggests potential for wearables-based gesture recognition with weak signals.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

### [105] [Natural Spectral Fusion: p-Exponent Cyclic Scheduling and Early Decision-Boundary Alignment in First-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04713)
*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF) reframes training as spectral control: first-order optimizers act as spectral controllers; employs cyclic reweighting of frequency bands via a p-exponent second-moment extension; yields broader spectral coverage, faster convergence, and reduced cost on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizers exhibit intrinsic spectral biases that shape the optimization path; current methods lack explicit spectral balancing, especially for first-order optimizers.

Method: NSF conceptual framework; adapt optimizers to dynamically balance low- and high-frequency information; cyclically reweight frequency bands without changing model/data/training; implement via a p-exponent extension of the second-moment term allowing positive/negative exponents; use cyclic scheduling.

Result: Theory and experiments show adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies; SGD near-neutral; negative exponents boost high-frequency info; cyclic scheduling broadens spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and enables early decision-boundary alignment; in experiments with fixed hyperparameters and identical learning-rate strategies, NSF reduces test error, and in some tasks matches baseline accuracy with only 1/4 training cost.

Conclusion: The optimizer acts as an active spectral controller; NSF provides a unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

### [106] [CoVeR: Conformal Calibration for Versatile and Reliable Autoregressive Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04733)
*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR is a model-free conformal-decoding method that provides provable coverage guarantees for autoregressive generation, balancing search efficiency with long-tail trajectory coverage through a PAC-style bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam search and similar decoding methods often lack coverage guarantees and struggle to cover long-tail trajectories essential for real-world tasks. There is a need for decoding strategies that are both efficient and provably comprehensive.

Method: Introduce CoVeR, a model-free decoding strategy within the conformal prediction framework. It maintains a compact search space while ensuring high coverage of desirable trajectories. The approach yields a PAC-style generalization bound guaranteeing asymptotic coverage of at least 1 - alpha for any alpha in (0,1).

Result: Theoretical guarantee: a PAC-style bound ensuring that CoVeR asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least 1 - alpha for any alpha in (0,1). The method also claims to keep the search space compact while achieving high coverage.

Conclusion: CoVeR provides a principled decoding framework that integrates conformal prediction with autoregressive generation, delivering provable coverage guarantees without requiring an explicit model-dependent decoding strategy. It offers a promising balance between search efficiency and trajectory coverage, with solid theoretical guarantees and potential real-world impact.

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

### [107] [Beyond I-Con: Exploring New Dimension of Distance Measures in Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04734)
*Jasmine Shone,Shaden Alshammari,Mark Hamilton,Zhening Li,William Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con proposes systematically exploring alternative divergences and similarity kernels to design loss functions for representation learning. It reports state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings by using total variation distance in the PMI algorithm, improved supervised contrastive learning with a TV distance and a distance-based similarity kernel over KL and an angular kernel, and superior qualitative and downstream performance in dimensionality reduction by replacing KL with a bounded f-divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL divergence is often asymmetric and unbounded, which may misalign optimization objectives and create numerical/optimization challenges in representation learning. The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework showed many methods implicitly minimize KL between data and learned similarity distributions, but a broader, more systematic exploration of divergences and kernels could yield better losses aligned with objectives.

Method: Introduce the Beyond I-Con framework to systematically explore alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels across three tasks. For unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, modify the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance. For supervised contrastive learning, replace KL with TV and employ a distance-based similarity kernel instead of an angular kernel. For dimensionality reduction (SNE-like), replace KL with a bounded f-divergence, yielding improved qualitative results and better downstream task performance.

Result: The framework achieves: (1) state-of-the-art results in unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings using TV-based PMI; (2) superior performance in supervised contrastive learning with TV and a distance-based kernel compared to KL and angular kernel; (3) improved qualitative results and better downstream performance in dimensionality reduction relative to SNE by using a bounded f-divergence.

Conclusion: Divergence and similarity-kernel choices substantially impact representation learning outcomes. The Beyond I-Con framework highlights the value of systematically evaluating alternative divergences and kernels rather than defaulting to KL-based losses, suggesting broader design space for robust and task-aligned representations.

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

### [108] [VARMA-Enhanced Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04782)
*Jiajun Song,Xiaoou Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARMAformer blends cross-attention efficiency with VARMA-inspired local patterns, via a VFE module and VE-atten, to capture both global and local temporal structures, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-attention-only transformers (e.g., CATS) are efficient but may miss fine-grained local temporal dependencies that classical models like VARMA capture; there is a need to integrate statistical insights into deep learning for time-series forecasting.

Method: Introduce VARMAformer with (1) a VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models autoregressive and moving-average patterns at the patch level, and (2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism with a temporal gate to make queries context-aware, combining these with a modern backbone.

Result: Empirical experiments on standard benchmarks show VARMAformer consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating strong performance gains from integrating classical statistical insights into deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: Integrating classical time-series statistics (AR/MA concepts) into deep learning backbones yields significant forecasting benefits, suggesting a fruitful direction for future time-series model design.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes three node unlearning methods for GNNs to efficiently remove training nodes and protect privacy, with topology-guided variants achieving superior performance on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks from training data leakage in graph neural networks; there is a need for efficient, topology-aware unlearning that preserves graph structure and model utility.

Method: Three methods are introduced: Class-based Label Replacement; Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability; and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among them, the topology-guided and class-consistent approaches exploit graph topology to improve unlearning effectiveness, and all methods are evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines on three datasets.

Result: The topology-informed methods demonstrate superior utility, unlearning utility, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while effectively removing sensitive training nodes.

Conclusion: The work advances privacy protection in GNNs by providing effective, topology-aware node unlearning techniques and offers insights into the privacy-utility trade-offs in graph learning.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ACED-DQN: an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of diversified DQN variants to tackle catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, inspired by brain-like arbitration in the prefrontal cortex; shows improved performance in static and continual environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting and poor transfer in RL under continual learning; inspired by human decision-making where multiple parallel agents (prefrontal cortex) arbitrate to select reliable actions.

Method: Construct an ensemble of diversified DQN variants with different value functions and implement an arbitration control that prioritizes agents with higher reliability (lower recent error). Introduce ACED-DQN, a framework for continual RL that combines diversification and arbitration.

Result: Empirical evidence show significant performance improvements in both static and continual environments, validating the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.

Conclusion: ACED-DQN provides a brain-inspired framework enabling continuous learning by combining diversified value-function ensembles with arbitration control, improving robustness in CRL tasks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

*Yuki Takemoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A methodology that uses artificial chaotic time series and resampling to train large-scale models for financial forecasting; achieves profitable zero-shot predictions on Bitcoin; reveals a scaling law linking training data size with horizon; suggests near-future event prediction is possible with substantial compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting financial time series is challenging and chaotic; synthetic chaotic data and resampling can augment training data; exploring scaling laws to improve long-horizon predictions.

Method: Generate artificial chaotic time series; apply resampling to create financial-like samples; extend predictive horizon by increasing resampling interval; pre-train on up to 10 billion samples per case; test on Bitcoin data with zero-shot predictions; evaluate via profitability of a simple trading strategy; analyze scaling behavior.

Result: Predictions yield significant profitability over autocorrelation baselines; observed a scaling law-like phenomenon where increasing training samples improves horizon-length predictive performance; potential for predictive near-future events given enough compute.

Conclusion: If robust across chaotic models, the scaling law could enable near-future predictions with substantial computational investment; calls for further large-scale training and cross-model validation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Conclusion: Algorithmic fusion of Transformer and BiGRU with feature selection and data augmentation yields a versatile IDS that reliably detects known attacks and swiftly adapts to emerging threats.

Abstract: In today's fast-paced digital communication, the surge in network traffic
data and frequency demands robust and precise network intrusion solutions.
Conventional machine learning methods struggle to grapple with complex patterns
within the vast network intrusion datasets, which suffer from data scarcity and
class imbalance. As a result, we have integrated machine learning and deep
learning techniques within the network intrusion detection system to bridge
this gap. This study has developed TrailGate, a novel framework that combines
machine learning and deep learning techniques. By integrating Transformer and
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architectures with advanced feature
selection strategies and supplemented by data augmentation techniques,
TrailGate can identifies common attack types and excels at detecting and
mitigating emerging threats. This algorithmic fusion excels at detecting common
and well-understood attack types and has the unique ability to swiftly identify
and neutralize emerging threats that stem from existing paradigms.

TL;DR: An embedding-based alignment of German job titles to standard ontologies via fine-tuned Sentence-BERT, enabling semantic search-based classification across vocabularies and multilingual extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-source occupational data reasoning is hampered by divergent vocabularies and costly manual ontologies; language-model embeddings offer scalable bridging without extensive hand curation.

Method: Construct a dataset from German Federal Employment Agency data; fine-tune Sentence-BERT to capture ontology-imposed structure; create a similarity graph linking (job title, embedding) to ontology classes; enable efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search; frame classification as a semantic search task; discuss design choices and plan extending to additional ontologies and multilingual titles.

Result: Proposes and demonstrates a scalable embedding-based alignment approach; defines enriched (job title, embedding) pairs as a similarity graph enabling semantic search; shows feasibility with public data; discusses design decisions, challenges, and ongoing work to extend the graph with more ontologies and multilingual titles.

Conclusion: Embedding-based alignment offers a flexible, scalable alternative to hand-crafted ontologies; supports adding more classes and multilingual expansions; future work includes integrating additional ontologies and multilingual resources.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNN–RNN hybrid yields the best EEG blink segmentation, attaining ~94–96% accuracy in healthy subjects and ~74–76% in Parkinson's patients, across 1/3/5 frontal channels with minimal preprocessing; robust sequence-to-sequence detection enables blink-rate statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blinking is a meaningful physiological marker for cognitive load, attention, and neurological conditions. Accurate blink detection from EEG is valuable, and assessing model robustness to tremor in PD is important.

Method: Formulate blink detection as a sequence-to-sequence segmentation task. Compare multiple deep learning architectures (RNNs, CNNs including standard and depthwise, temporal convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrids) using 1/3/5 frontal EEG channels. Train on raw EEG with minimal preprocessing on a public UCSD dataset of 31 subjects (15 healthy, 16 PD). Evaluate performance on blink vs non-blink segmentation and compute blink-rate statistics.

Result: CNN–RNN hybrid model consistently outperforms all others for EEG blink segmentation, achieving 93.8%, 95.4%, 95.8% accuracy with 1, 3, 5 channels in healthy subjects, and 73.8%, 75.4%, 75.8% in PD patients respectively.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based EEG blink segmentation is feasible and robust. A CNN–RNN hybrid provides the strongest performance, enabling reliable blink-rate metrics with minimal preprocessing. PD tremor reduces accuracy compared with healthy controls, but multisite channels mitigate the loss; results are constrained by the relatively small, single-dataset sample.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

### [116] [On the Normalization of Confusion Matrices: Methods and Geometric Interpretations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04959)
*Johan Erbani,Pierre-Edouard Portier,Elod Egyed-Zsigmond,Sonia Ben Mokhtar,Diana Nurbakova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bistochastic normalization of confusion matrices via Iterative Proportional Fitting to separate class similarity from distribution bias, enabling better model diagnostics and linking to internal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In heterogeneous settings, confusion matrices conflate class confusion and skewed distributions, making it hard to attribute errors; disentangling these factors can guide targeted improvements.

Method: Apply Iterative Proportional Fitting to obtain a bistochastic (row- and column-normalized) confusion matrix, generalizing standard normalizations. This recovers the pure structure of class similarity and relates to the model's internal class representations; the interpretation has a geometric flavor.

Result: Disentangles two sources of error—class similarity and distribution bias—leading to more accurate model diagnosis and targeted improvements; establishes a correspondence between normalization and the model's internal representations.

Conclusion: Bistochastic normalization provides deeper insights into classifier behavior than standard normalizations and supports more informed improvements; it also offers a conceptual bridge to the model's representation space.

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

*Arthur Bizzi,Leonardo M. Moreira,Márcio Marques,Leonardo Mendonça,Christian Júnior de Oliveira,Vitor Balestro,Lucas dos Santos Fernandez,Daniel Yukimura,Pavel Petrov,João M. Pereira,Tiago Novello,Lucas Nissenbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures) combines spectral projection with Neural ODEs to form a spectral PINN framework that mitigates spectral bias and enforces causality in solving linear and nonlinear PDEs with variable coefficients, achieving faster convergence and better temporal consistency than standard PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLP-based PINNs struggle with convergence on complex initial-value problems, exhibit causality violations, and suffer from spectral bias toward low-frequency components. There is a need for architectures that leverage spectral representations while maintaining causal, forward-time dynamics.

Method: NeuSA projects the PDE onto a spectral basis to obtain a finite-dimensional dynamical system, which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE. An initialization scheme based on classical methods starts training near the target solution, and the spectral representation enables high-frequency components to overcome spectral bias. The approach applies to both linear and nonlinear PDEs with variable coefficients.

Result: Validated on canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, NeuSA shows faster convergence, improved temporal consistency, and higher predictive accuracy compared to other architectures.

Conclusion: NeuSA successfully combines spectral methods with PINNs to address causality and spectral bias, offering strong performance on wave equation benchmarks and providing code and pretrained models for replication.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

### [118] [Topology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Routing in Cloud Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04973)
*Yuxi Wang,Heyao Liu,Guanzi Yao,Nyutian Long,Yue Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A topology-aware graph reinforcement learning framework (SASE + PAGU) for routing in cloud networks that captures high-order topology and adapts the graph as policy changes; outperforms baselines on GEANT with robust performance under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic network topologies impede optimal routing; there is a need for expressive state representations and adaptive structural updates.

Method: Introduce Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) using multi-layer GCN and structural positional embeddings to capture high-order topology; introduce Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) to modify graph structure based on policy shifts and reward feedback; integrate into a unified framework and evaluate on GEANT; perform ablations including hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity perturbation, and feature dimension variation.

Result: Outperforms existing graph RL baselines in throughput, latency control, and link balance; demonstrates robustness to structure perturbations and feature changes; shows efficient and robust routing in dynamic cloud networks.

Conclusion: Topology-aware state encoding and adaptive graph updates substantially enhance routing decisions in dynamic cloud environments; the framework provides improved stability and performance across metrics and perturbations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

*Shuaicheng Niu,Guohao Chen,Deyu Chen,Yifan Zhang,Jiaxiang Wu,Zhiquan Wen,Yaofo Chen,Peilin Zhao,Chunyan Miao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stability issues in test-time adaptation due to batch-norm reliance; propose SAR and SAR^2 with norm-agnostic regularizers to stabilize TTA under mixed shifts, small batch, and online label shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTA performance can degrade under realistic test-time shifts; batch norm and gradient/noise cause instability; need robust, scalable methods.

Method: Introduce SAR, a sharpness-aware reliable entropy minimization that filters noisy samples with large gradients and seeks flat minima; then SAR^2 with redundancy regularizer to reduce inter-feature correlations and inequity regularizer to maximize entropy of a prototype centroid; apply with group or layer norms to avoid batch norm issues.

Result: Empirical results show improved stability over prior TTA methods under challenging scenarios; computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SAR and SAR^2 offer stable, efficient TTA under mixed distribution shifts and small batch sizes by mitigating noisy gradients, reducing representation collapse, and preventing biased predictions.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

*Matouš Soldát,Jiří Kléma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian-optimization-based directed evolution framework uses language-model embeddings to improve variant screening efficiency and outperforms regression-based ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To boost efficiency of directed evolution by using informative, high-quality representations from pre-trained protein language models to guide Bayesian optimization, reducing screening requirements.

Method: Combine Bayesian optimization with embeddings from a pre-trained protein language model to create an informative representation of protein variants for acquisition decisions in directed evolution.

Result: The sequence-embedding representation significantly improves Bayesian optimization performance, achieving better results with the same screening budget and surpassing state-of-the-art ML-assisted directed evolution methods that optimize regression objectives.

Conclusion: Protein-variant representations from language-model embeddings can substantially enhance ML-guided directed evolution, enabling more efficient discovery with limited screening resources.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

### [121] [Depth-Aware Initialization for Stable and Efficient Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05018)
*Vijay Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A depth-aware initialization strategy that scales variance across layers using per-layer depth information, addressing the breakdown of unit-variance assumptions in deep networks and improving performance over standard schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural network initialization by incorporating depth information—both per-layer and total depth—so that activation/gradient variance can be better preserved in deep nets.

Method: Introduce a novel initialization method that flexibly increases variance across layers based on layer depth information; integrates both per-layer depth and total network depth to set initial weights.

Result: Empirical experiments show the proposed depth-aware initialization outperforms existing schemes (e.g., Glorot, He, orthogonal, random-walk) on deep networks.

Conclusion: Incorporating layer-wise depth information into initialization is beneficial; unit-variance throughout a deep network is not sufficient; a depth-aware variance growth strategy yields better training performance.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

*Noorul Wahab,Ethar Alzaid,Jiaqi Lv,Adam Shephard,Shan E Ahmed Raza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MultiSurv is a multimodal deep survival model that fuses clinical, imaging, transcriptomic, and pathology data to predict time-to-event outcomes in prostate and bladder cancer; it shows strong performance for prostate biochemical recurrence and moderate performance for bladder cancer recurrence, indicating potential for personalized risk stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-to-event prediction in oncology is crucial for treatment planning; leveraging heterogeneous data sources can uncover complementary prognostic signals not captured by single modalities.

Method: A DeepHit-based multimodal architecture with a projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention that integrates clinical, MRI, RNA-seq, and whole-slide pathology features to estimate individualized time-to-event metrics; evaluated on CHIMERA Grand Challenge Tasks 1 (prostate biochemical recurrence) and 3 (bladder cancer recurrence).

Result: Task 1 (prostate): C-index 0.843 on 5-fold cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set. Task 3 (bladder): C-index 0.662 on 5-fold cross-validation and 0.457 on development set.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that multimodal integration with deep survival learning is a promising strategy for personalized risk stratification in prostate and bladder cancer, with potential applicability beyond CHIMERA tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

*Tim Dernedde,Daniela Thyssens,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A recurrent encoder reuses previous-step embeddings to reuse computation in construction-based neural combinatorial optimization, achieving similar or better accuracy with far fewer layers and lower latency; validated on TSP, CVRP, and OP and applied within a large-neighborhood search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit the observation that state changes between construction steps are small, enabling computation reuse to reduce latency in neural combinatorial optimization.

Method: Train a recurrent encoder that computes state embeddings using both the current state and embeddings from the previous step; evaluate on TSP, CVRP, and OP; integrate the model into a large neighborhood search (LNS) framework to assess practical impact.

Result: The recurrent encoder achieves equivalent or better performance with 3× fewer layers, significantly reducing latency; demonstrated on TSP, CVRP, and OP and incorporated into LNS to show practical relevance.

Conclusion: A recurrent encoding strategy effectively reuses computation in construction-based NCO, delivering latency improvements and competitive performance across multiple problems and enabling practical deployment within search-based optimization pipelines.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

*Rafael Bischof,Michal Piovarči,Michael A. Kraus,Siddhartha Mishra,Bernd Bickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO is a Swin-transformer based hypernetwork neural operator enabling zero-shot generalization across 2D parametric PDEs (elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic) with varied terms/boundaries using MMS-labeled data and physics-informed objectives; achieves strong zero-shot accuracy, improves further via an iterative delta-PINN ensemble, and enables faster fine-tuning, suggesting a scalable foundation for complex neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a generalizable neural operator that can solve a broad class of parametric PDEs without task-specific fine-tuning, accommodating different equation types, geometries, source terms, and mixed boundary conditions while offering efficient inference and improved accuracy.

Method: A Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork (HyPINO) that maps PDE parametrizations to target PINNs, trained with mixed supervision: (i) labeled MMS-generated analytical solutions; (ii) unlabeled samples optimized with physics-informed objectives. Handles linear elliptic/hyperbolic/parabolic equations in 2D with varying sources, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundaries including interior boundaries. Introduces an iterative refinement to create a delta-PINN from PDE-discrepancies, forming an ensemble whose solutions are summed to progressively reduce error. Evaluates forward-inference and analyzes fine-tuning behavior with HyPINO-initialized PINNs.

Result: HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven PINN benchmarks, outperforming U-Nets, Poseidon, and PINO. The delta-PINN ensemble further reduces error across six benchmarks, yielding up to 100x improvement in average L2 loss in the best case, while preserving forward-only inference. Fine-tuning experiments show HyPINO-initialized PINNs converge faster and to lower final error than randomly initialized or Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks (parity on two).

Conclusion: HyPINO demonstrates a scalable, zero-shot generalizable foundation for neural operators that can tackle increasingly complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional PDEs with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost, with promising implications for broad applicability and downstream tasks.

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

*Davide Pirovano,Federico Milanesio,Michele Caselle,Piero Fariselli,Matteo Osella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-grained labels do not universally help; benefits depend on data geometry, label hierarchy, dataset size, and model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when training with finer-grained labels improves or harms performance beyond the target level in hierarchical classification.

Method: Theoretical and empirical study using real and synthetic datasets, analyzing geometric structure and label relations, and varying dataset size and model capacity.

Result: No universal gain from fine-grained labels; effectiveness hinges on data geometry and label relations; gains are moderated by dataset size and model capacity.

Conclusion: Practical guidance: when to use fine-grained labels depends on geometry and resources; design should consider hierarchy geometry, data size, and model capacity.

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

*Tosca Lechner,Alex Bie,Gautam Kamath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive adversaries make learnability harder; additive adaptive learnability is strictly stronger than additive oblivious learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand robustness of distribution learning when an adversary can intercept and manipulate samples with full knowledge, constrained by a budget.

Method: Define a general learnability notion under adaptive adversaries with an adversary budget, then compare it to the oblivious-adversary setting and analyze separations.

Result: A strict separation is established: learnability under additive adaptive adversaries is strictly stronger than under additive oblivious adversaries.

Conclusion: Adaptive adaptivity increases the difficulty of learnability; the budgeted-adversary model yields stronger requirements than the oblivious model, guiding design of robust learners and prompting further study.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on integrating federated learning with foundational models, introducing a lifecycle-based taxonomy, comparing methods, and offering practical guidelines, with a healthcare case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many large foundational models require distributed data and resources. There is no unified survey at this intersection, and practitioners need guidance for privacy-preserving collaboration and deployment.

Method: Systematic literature review starting from 4,200 articles, narrowed to 250 thoroughly reviewed works and 42 unique methods. The authors construct a taxonomy aligned with development lifecycle stages and perform technical comparisons focusing on complexity, efficiency, and scalability. A healthcare case study illustrates practical impact.

Result: Provides a self-contained overview of the field, a lifecycle-based taxonomy, cross-method comparisons, and actionable guidelines for implementing and evolving federated learning with foundational models, including topics like self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and transfer learning.

Conclusion: Federated learning and foundational models are a promising combination for privacy-preserving collaboration. The survey delivers a structured framework and practical guidance to adopt, adapt, and advance these techniques, with demonstrated relevance to healthcare and a roadmap for future work.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Motivation: KV caches grow with context length and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck for long-context inference; prior compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels.

Method: Aggregate attention scores to estimate token importance, select head-specific tokens independently, and align them into composite tokens that fit a uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism adapts retention budgets across layers, prioritizing layers with more informative tokens.

Result: Significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy; consistently outperforms prior structured and semi-structured compression methods; fully compatible with standard inference pipelines.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable KV-cache compression framework enabling efficient long-context LLM deployment without bespoke hardware or kernels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

### [129] [Accuracy-Constrained CNN Pruning for Efficient and Reliable EEG-Based Seizure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05190)
*Mounvik K,N Harshit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight 1D CNN for EEG seizure detection maintains performance after 50% structured pruning, achieving similar/high accuracy and macro-F1 with half the parameters, aided by mild early stopping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient, reliable seizure detection in resource-constrained environments; reduce model size and compute while preventing overfitting.

Method: Design a light 1D CNN; train with mild early stopping; apply structured pruning to remove 50% of convolutional kernels based on importance; evaluate on accuracy and macro-F1; report weight/memory reduction and precision.

Result: Baseline accuracy 92.78%, macro-F1 0.8686; after pruning: precision 92.87%, macro-F1 0.8707; both accuracy and macro-F1 improved slightly; pruning reduced weights/memory by 50%.

Conclusion: Structured pruning removes redundancy, improves generalization; combined with mild early stopping offers an efficient and reliable approach for seizure detection in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

### [130] [Shift Before You Learn: Enabling Low-Rank Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05193)
*Bastien Dubail,Stefan Stojanovic,Alexandre Proutière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shifted successor measures reveal a practical low-rank structure enabling finite-sample low-rank approximation and estimation in RL; theory via Type II Poincaré inequalities links shift to spectral decay and local mixing; empirical results show improved goal-conditioned RL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the assumption that successor measures are low-rank; propose that a shifted variant has low-rank structure, leading to better data efficiency and provable guarantees.

Method: Develop finite-sample entry-wise estimation bounds for low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure; introduce Type II Poincaré inequalities to bound spectral recoverability; analyze shift dependency on spectral decay and mixing; validate with experiments.

Result: Bounds show error governed by spectral recoverability; shift needed is small due to fast decay of higher singular values; connection established between shift and local mixing; experiments demonstrate improved performance in goal-conditioned RL when using shifted measures.

Conclusion: Shifting the successor measure yields a principled, practically useful low-rank representation for RL, with concrete guidelines for selecting shift based on spectral decay and mixing; the approach improves performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Conclusion: RapidGNN effectively mitigates communication bottlenecks in distributed GNN training through deterministic sampling-based scheduling, delivering significant gains in throughput, data fetch reduction, scalability, and energy efficiency across diverse graph benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the two key challenges in federated learning for large-scale DNNs: data heterogeneity causing client drift and high resource costs (communication, computation, memory).

Method: FedSub uses subspace projection to constrain local updates to low-dimensional subspaces and introduces low-dimensional dual variables to mitigate client drift; provides convergence analysis showing how step size and subspace projection matrices affect convergence.

Result: The paper provides theoretical convergence insights and shows empirical efficiency through experiments, validating the approach.

Conclusion: FedSub offers an efficient and scalable solution for FL on heterogeneous data, achieving reduced resource usage and improved convergence in the presence of client drift.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

*Lokendra Poudel,David Tincher,Duy-Nhat Phan,Rahul Bhowmik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-driven deep learning models predict amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion CCS, achieving >99% accuracy and enabling real-time monitoring and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate predictive and prescriptive tools to monitor and optimize emissions and process KPIs in CCS operations, to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Method: Using CESAR1 solvent campaign data, four DL architectures (Basic LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, ConvLSTM) were developed to predict amine emissions (AMP and Piperazine via FTIR and IMR-MS) and system KPIs (CO2 product flow, absorber outlet temp, depleted flue gas outlet temp, RFCC stripper bottom temp). Causal impact analysis perturbed eight input variables by ±20% to assess influence on emissions and performance.

Result: Models achieved predictive accuracy >99%, captured steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Causal analysis identified that adjusting parameters such as lean solvent temperature and water wash conditions can significantly reduce emissions and improve performance.

Conclusion: The ML framework serves as both a predictive and prescriptive tool for optimizing CCS operations under steady-state and dynamic conditions, enabling real-time monitoring, scenario testing, and operational optimization toward smarter, more sustainable carbon capture processes.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

*Jehad Jilan,Niranjana Naveen Nambiar,Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Alok Paranjape,Amr Youssef,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based detector for FDIA in AGC achieving high detection rates and providing interpretable symbolic formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDIA threats threaten AGC stability and traditional detectors often rely on black-box models; there is a need for accurate, interpretable detection that accounts for nonlinear system behavior.

Method: Train Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks offline to learn the nonlinear relationships of AGC measurements across diverse operating scenarios; extract symbolic equations from the trained model to enhance interpretability; evaluate detection performance and false alarm rate.

Result: FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% for the initial model and 95.9% for the symbolic formula, with a low false alarm rate.

Conclusion: KAN offers a reliable and interpretable approach for detecting FDIA in AGC, with the added benefit of symbolic extraction to improve transparency and trust in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

*Jason Gardner,Ayan Dutta,Swapnoneel Roy,O. Patrick Kreidl,Ladislau Boloni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic energy-efficiency benchmark of seven DRL algorithms on Atari shows substantial variation in energy, emissions, and cost, with some algorithms achieving comparable learning performance at lower environmental and monetary costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As DRL models grow larger, their training energy usage, emissions, and costs become nontrivial. This work investigates whether algorithmic choices can reduce environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.

Method: Train 1,000,000 steps per algorithm on 10 Atari 2600 games using Stable Baselines. Real-time power measurement yields total energy consumption, CO2-equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on U.S. average prices.

Result: Energy efficiency varies significantly across algorithms. Some reach comparable performance with up to 24% less energy than DQN; QR-DQN and RecurrentPPO show about 68% differences in cost and emissions. The study also analyzes trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and monetary cost, identifying scenarios where algorithmic choices reduce environmental and financial impact without harming performance.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable guidance for deploying energy-aware DRL practices and motivate incorporating sustainability considerations into DRL algorithm design and evaluation.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: Brain-inspired SpikingBrain models enable efficient long-context training/inference on non-NVIDIA hardware with linear/hybrid-linear attention, achieving substantial speedups and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based LLMs face quadratic compute with sequence length and linear memory for inference, plus deployment challenges on non-NVIDIA hardware that hinder stable training; there is a need for energy-efficient, scalable long-context models.

Method: Introduce SpikingBrain family with adaptive spiking neurons, linear and hybrid-linear attention; develop conversion-based training pipeline and spike coding framework; deploy system-level optimizations including frameworks, libraries, and hardware-tailored parallelism for MetaX; build two models: SpikingBrain-7B (linear LLM) and SpikingBrain-76B (hybrid-linear MoE LLM).

Result: Comparable to open-source Transformer baselines with ~150B tokens of continual pre-training; >100x Time to First Token speedup for 4M-token sequences; long training stability over weeks on hundreds of MetaX GPUs; Model FLOPs Utilization 23.4%; spike scheme yields 69.15% sparsity; inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking; demonstrates feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired mechanisms can enable efficient, scalable large-model design for long-context processing, delivering stable training and efficient inference even on non-NVIDIA hardware; suggests a path toward energy-efficient, scalable LLMs.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

TL;DR: A learned GNN-based tuner improves distributed ADMM by predicting adaptive step sizes and communication weights, unrolled and trained end-to-end to accelerate convergence and improve solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM offers strong convergence guarantees and is well-suited for decentralized computation, but it can converge slowly and be sensitive to hyperparameters in distributed settings. Learning to adapt hyperparameters online can speed up convergence.

Method: Model distributed ADMM iterations as graph message passing and use a Graph Neural Network to predict hyperparameters (step sizes, weights) from the current iterates. Unroll a fixed number of ADMM iterations and train end-to-end to minimize final error while preserving convergence properties.

Result: The learned variant consistently outperforms standard ADMM in convergence speed and solution quality on the tested problem class; code for replication is provided.

Conclusion: Learning adaptive hyperparameters for distributed ADMM via GNNs can accelerate convergence while maintaining convergence properties, with end-to-end training on a problem class.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

*Xiao Yang,Mehdi Ben Ayed,Longyu Zhao,Fan Zhou,Yuchen Shen,Abe Engle,Jinfeng Zhuang,Ling Leng,Jiajing Xu,Charles Rosenberg,Prathibha Deshikachar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DRL-based framework (DRL-PUT) for personalized utility tuning in ad recommender systems, framing hyperparameter tuning as an RL problem to optimize multi-objective rewards using online logs, yielding gains in CTR and long CTR vs manual tuning in an online Pinterest experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual tuning of ranking utility is suboptimal due to unprincipled objectives, combinatorial search, and lack of personalization to user/seasonality; a principled, adaptive approach is needed to balance platform, advertisers, and user goals.

Method: Formulate as a reinforcement learning task where the state is an ad request and the action is the selection of hyperparameters. Propose a direct policy learning approach that uses online serving logs to learn a policy without estimating a value function, addressing high variance and reward imbalance.

Result: Online A/B test on Pinterest's ad recommender showed DRL-PUT improved click-through rate by 9.7% and long click-through rate by 7.7% on the treated segment compared to manual tuning; ablations analyzed reward definitions and personalization effects.

Conclusion: A principled DRL-based personalized utility tuning framework can outperform manual tuning in ad ranking by learning adaptive hyperparameters from live data, with positive impact on short- and long-term engagement and evidence of personalization benefits.

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.
