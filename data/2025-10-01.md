### [1] [PFDepth: Heterogeneous Pinhole-Fisheye Joint Depth Estimation via Distortion-aware Gaussian-Splatted Volumetric Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26008)
*Zhiwei Zhang,Ruikai Xu,Weijian Zhang,Zhizhong Zhang,Xin Tan,Jingyu Gong,Yuan Xie,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFDepth introduces a unified pinhole–fisheye framework for heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation that lifts features into a 3D volume, uses distortion-aware fusion with a 3D Gaussian voxel representation, and achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI-360 and RealHet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the complementary strengths of pinhole (undistorted, small FOV, distant content) and fisheye (distorted, large FOV, nearby content) imagery and to handle arbitrary heterogeneity in camera intrinsics/extrinsics, enabling more accurate depth estimation in multi-camera setups.

Method: A unified architecture that processes arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras; lifts 2D features from each view into a canonical 3D volume; uses Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion to fuse distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping regions; replaces conventional voxel fusion with a 3D Gaussian representation where learnable latent Gaussian spheres adapt to local textures; renders fused volume features into multi-view depth maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets versus mainstream depth networks; constitutes the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation and provides technical novelty plus empirical insights.

Conclusion: PFDepth demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of joint optimization across heterogeneous pinhole and fisheye views using distortion-aware volumetric fusion, offering a new framework and empirical findings that advance depth estimation in diverse camera rigs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

### [2] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA introduces a dual-path anchoring diffusion model for text-to-motion generation to improve semantic alignment and reduce gradient bottlenecks, achieving SOTA results and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-motion models suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts due to gradient attenuation in deep networks, hindering high-level feature learning.

Method: LUMA uses dual-path anchoring: (1) a lightweight MoCLIP-like semantic supervision path trained via contrastive learning without external data for temporal alignment; (2) a frequency-domain path using low-frequency DCT components to capture semantic cues; these anchors are adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism to transition from coarse to fine alignment during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML with FID of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively, and accelerates convergence by 1.4x over baselines.

Conclusion: LUMA provides an efficient, scalable solution that improves semantic alignment and reduces training/inference bottlenecks in text-to-motion diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity motion generation.

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [3] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload is a VQA benchmark of 2,720 QA pairs on high-res paintings to stress-test VLMs; current top models perform poorly on dense scenes, with only 19.6% accuracy on hardest split and 69.5% overall, revealing gaps in counting, OCR, and logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks may overestimate VLM capabilities; dense, multi-agent scenes with details require counting, OCR, and robust reasoning; paintings offer densely annotated scenes; a dataset like VisualOverload is needed to push progress.

Method: Assemble dataset from public-domain painting scans; annotate questions across six categories; privately held ground-truth answers; evaluate 37 models including top model o3; perform error analysis.

Result: Best model achieves 19.6% accuracy on hardest split; 69.5% overall; errors include counting failures, OCR failures, and inconsistent reasoning.

Conclusion: VisualOverload reveals a significant gap in current vision models; provides a resource to drive development of models with improved counting, OCR, and reasoning; suggests directions for future work.

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [4] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework to edit physiological signals (HR) in videos while preserving visual fidelity, using a 3D VAE for video encoding, a frozen text encoder for HR prompts, AdaLN-based spatio-temporal fusion, and FiLM-based decoding to modulate rPPG signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faces in videos can reveal health and emotional information through rPPG signals, raising privacy concerns. The paper proposes controllable, privacy-preserving editing of physiological cues without sacrificing visual quality.

Method: Encode video with a pretrained 3D VAE. Embed the target HR cue with a frozen text encoder. Fuse via trainable spatio-temporal layers using Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture rPPG temporal coherence. Use FiLM in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to preserve physiological signals during reconstruction and enable accurate modulation.

Result: The approach achieves high visual fidelity (average PSNR ≈ 39 dB, SSIM ≈ 0.98) and HR modulation accuracy (≈10 bpm MAE and ≈10.0% MAPE) when evaluated with a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.

Conclusion: The framework enables controllable HR editing in videos with preserved appearance, supporting privacy-preserving anonymization of biometric signals and realistic synthesis with desired vital signs.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [5] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench is a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark evaluating spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) through perspective-taking tasks across translation, rotation, object-relative pose, and viewpoint changes; it reveals systematic weaknesses in current VLMs and correlates with human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill gaps in assessing how VLMs reason about spatial space and viewpoint transformations, which require object recognition across views, relative-position grounding, and mental simulation; existing benchmarks lack fine-grained perspective-taking categories.

Method: Design of graded diagnostic categories spanning single-object to multi-object perspective-taking; evaluation of 37 state-of-the-art VLMs (proprietary and open-source); analysis includes translation, rotation, relative pose, and viewpoint change; tests for symmetry, syntactic reformulations; scaling analysis; human subjects testing; correlation with response time.

Result: VLMs show egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetry and syntax changes; scaling yields both gradual improvements and emergent capabilities; humans achieve 91.2% accuracy, with human response time correlating with VLM accuracy.

Conclusion: SpinBench highlights essential gaps in spatial reasoning for VLMs and offers a robust diagnostic framework; provides actionable insights for improving VLMs; an accompanying website is available.

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our
website can be found at https://spinbench25.github.io/.

### [6] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [7] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can achieve expert-level depth understanding with sparse, text-guided finetuning without changing architecture or losses; DepthLM uses visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation to combat pixel reference and camera ambiguity, surpassing many VLMs and approaching pure vision models, and enabling broader 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between versatile vision-language models and expert pure-vision models in 3D understanding, by showing that expert-level metric depth accuracy is attainable without architecture or loss changes.

Method: Text-based supervised finetuning of VLMs using sparse per-pixel depth labels, avoiding dense prediction heads and complex regression losses. Introduces visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation to mitigate pixel reference issues and cross-dataset camera ambiguity.

Result: DepthLM with smaller models surpasses most advanced VLMs by over 2x in depth accuracy and approaches, or becomes comparable to, pure vision models. It also naturally reduces over-smoothing at boundaries and generalizes to multiple 3D tasks.

Conclusion: A simple, label-efficient finetuning approach can unlock strong 3D understanding in VLMs, suggesting broad potential for 3D tasks beyond depth and enabling single models to handle diverse 3D perception tasks without bespoke architectures.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [8] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration mapping with uncertainty; fuses Sentinel-1, RCM, AMSR2 to provide high-res SIC and robust uncertainty maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need high-resolution SIC with reliable uncertainty amid subtle ice features, model uncertainty, and data heterogeneity; existing methods struggle with uncertainty quantification and data fusion.

Method: Develop a high-res Transformer with global and local modules for feature extraction; extend it with Bayesian treatment of parameters; fuse Sentinel-1, RCM, AMSR2 at decision level for SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification.

Result: On Pan-Arctic data from Sept 2021, yields high-resolution SIC maps and robust uncertainty maps, outperforming traditional uncertainty quantification methods.

Conclusion: Shows promise of Bayesian Transformer with multi-sensor data fusion for accurate SIC mapping and uncertainty estimation in Arctic regions.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KF-based late fusion of roadside camera and LiDAR in a cosimulation framework yields more accurate vehicle detection/localization; longitudinal error reduced up to 70% and lateral accuracy kept at 1–3 m, validated in field with degraded single-sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-risk road segments (e.g., work zones) pose safety challenges due to perspective distortion, occlusions, complex geometry, and cost. Infrastructure-based sensing aims to provide reliable, continuous vehicle tracking to enhance safety, but existing sensors alone struggle under adverse conditions.

Method: Integrate roadside camera and LiDAR in a cosimulation environment to develop a scalable detection/localization framework, then apply a Kalman Filter–based late fusion to merge sensor outputs and improve trajectory consistency. Field validation uses LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth to assess robustness when sensors are intermittently degraded.

Result: Simulation shows longitudinal error reduced up to 70% with lateral accuracy maintained at 1–3 m. Field tests demonstrate fused trajectories closely follow true vehicle paths even when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded.

Conclusion: Kalman Filter–based sensor fusion can compensate for individual sensor limitations, delivering precise, robust vehicle tracking and enabling practical deployment of infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor safety systems in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [10] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Forensic-Chat and ExplainFake-Bench to improve AI-generated image detection by teaching multimodal LLMs to perceive low-level forensic cues before reasoning, addressing perceptual and data-distribution gaps while enabling explainable, multi-turn dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle at forensic detection because their vision encoders favor high-level semantics and their training data formats for detection diverge from real-world distributions, causing reliance on linguistic shortcuts and forgetting pretrained capabilities.

Method: Introduce a perceptual pretraining regime to strengthen artifact-aware visual perception; develop Forensic-Chat as a generalizable, explainable, conversational assistant for fake image detection; create ExplainFake-Bench to evaluate explainability across five aspects in image forensics.

Result: Empirical results show improved generalization and genuinely reliable explainability compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Adopt a seeing-before-reasoning paradigm where MLLMs perceive artifacts with better visual perception prior to reasoning, enabling robust, explainable fake-image detection in multi-round dialogues.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [11] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First real-time deepfake detector using gaze point tracking from the displayed screen; reports 82% accuracy on a novel dataset; novelty lies in using gaze as a biometric cue for deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes enable real-time phishing in video calls. Gaze patterns in dyadic conversations are a subtle nonverbal cue that current detectors may miss, offering a new detection signal.

Method: Real-time detector built on explainable, gaze-based features selected from literature on gaze behavior in dyadic conversations; evaluated on a novel dataset created by the authors.

Result: Accuracy of 82% on the authors' novel dataset; claims to be the first to leverage point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Gaze-point tracking can provide a viable biometric signal for detecting real-time deepfakes; promising results, but generalization, gaze-estimation reliability, and privacy considerations warrant further study.

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

*Tu-Hoa Pham,Philip Bailey,Daniel Posada,Georgios Georgakis,Jorge Enriquez,Surya Suresh,Marco Dolci,Philip Twu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust 6-DoF pose estimation from textureless 3D models on compute/memory-constrained hardware using a custom renderer and edge-based template matching; validated on synthetic data and Earth/Mars imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Mars Sample Return, need precise pose estimates for multiple objects under low-clearance constraints and hardware limits; existing methods often rely on textured models or heavy computation.

Method: A localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer with a novel edge-domain template-matching metric designed for textureless 3D models, enabling robust pose estimation on low-fidelity inputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in compute and memory efficiency while maintaining robustness and accuracy across synthetic datasets and real-world Earth and in situ Mars imagery.

Conclusion: Enables cheap, reliable pose localization on general-purpose hardware, expanding autonomous operation possibilities in resource-constrained planetary robotics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [13] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot hybrid grounding pipeline (LLM-RG) fuses off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained attribute extraction with LLMs for symbolic reasoning to locate referents in outdoor driving scenes, achieving strong Talk2Car results and benefiting from 3D spatial cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor driving environments exhibit massive variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate natural-language referring expressions. There is a need to leverage both visual perception models and large language models to robustly ground references in such scenes.

Method: The approach uses an LLM to parse a free-form referring expression to identify target object types and attributes, detects candidate regions, and then uses a VLM to generate rich visual descriptors for those regions. These descriptors are combined with spatial metadata to form natural-language prompts, which are fed to the LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. The system operates in a zero-shot manner and is aided by ablations showing the benefit of including 3D spatial cues.

Result: On the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM- and VLM-based baselines. Ablation studies show that incorporating 3D spatial cues further improves grounding performance.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs for robust outdoor referential grounding in a zero-shot setting, highlighting the value of combining attribute extraction, region detection, and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [14] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++ introduces universal visual inputs to steer vision-language models (VLMs) via crafted images, enabling cross-model behavioral control without runtime model access. A single VISOR++ image can align multiple models toward target activations, supporting directions like refusal, sycophancy, and survival instinct, while preserving performance on unrelated tasks (e.g., 99.9% on 14,000 MMLU tasks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe and controllable behavior in VLMs, addressing the limitations of system prompts (prone to override) and activation-based steering (requires invasive runtime access). The goal is a deployment-agnostic, transfer-friendly steering method that works across multiple VLMs, including closed-source or API-based systems.

Method: Propose VISOR++: optimize universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns across an ensemble of VLMs. A single generated image can replicate steering vectors across different models. The study evaluates three alignment directions (refusal, sycophancy, survival instinct) on open-access models (LLaVA-1.5-7B, IDEFICS2-8B) and tests performance on both positive and negative steering tasks. It also explores transfer to unseen models (including closed-access) and demonstrates that VISOR++ images preserve 99.9% of unrelated MMLU task performance.

Result: VISOR++ images achieve performance parity with model-specific steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks, and demonstrate directional behavioral shifts on unseen models. The approach remains deployment-agnostic, does not require runtime model access, and largely preserves existing task performance (99.9% on MMLU).

Conclusion: Universal visual inputs can effectively steer VLMs across diverse architectures without internal access, enabling safe and transferable behavioral control. The method shows strong cross-model transferability and preserves general task ability, suggesting practicality for real-world deployments, including with closed APIs. Further work may explore robustness, ethical implications, and limits of transfer to a wider set of models.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

### [15] [Vision-Zero: Scalable VLM Self-Improvement via Strategic Gamified Self-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25541)
*Qinsi Wang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Zhou,Jing Shi,Yueqian Lin,Yiran Chen,Hai Helen Li,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Zero introduces a domain-agnostic framework for self-improving vision-language models via competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs. It combines a strategic self-play paradigm (Who Is the Spy), arbitrary-image game generation (synthetic CLEVR scenes, charts, real images), and Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to achieve sustained, label-free performance gains that surpass annotation-based methods across reasoning, chart QA, and vision-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based improvements in VLM reasoning rely on costly human-annotated datasets, limiting scalability and deployment. A label-free, self-improving approach that generalizes across domains is highly desirable to reduce training costs and broaden applicability.

Method: Vision-Zero comprises three main components: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework where VLMs engage in Who Is the Spy-style games across multiple roles to autonomously generate training data; (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images, enabling games from diverse image domains (CLEVR-like scenes, charts, real-world images); (3) Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) that alternates Self-Play with Reinforcement Learning using verifiable rewards (RLVR) to avoid performance plateaus and ensure long-term improvements.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, without relying on labeled data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse image domains.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero demonstrates that label-free, self-play-based training can yield sustained performance gains and broad domain generalization for VLMs, offering a scalable path to high-quality reasoning capabilities without exhaustive annotation.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

### [16] [Hybrid Approach for Enhancing Lesion Segmentation in Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25549)
*Mohammadmahdi Eshragh,Emad A. Mohammed,Behrouz Far,Ezekiel Weis,Carol L Shields,Sandor R Ferenczy,Trafford Crump*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid segmentation model combining mathematical/clustering methods with U-Net guidance improves choroidal nevus lesion segmentation on high-res fundus images, achieving superior Dice and IoU and better generalization than Attention U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, accurate segmentation of choroidal nevi is critical for melanoma risk assessment. Datasets are often low-resolution and poorly labeled, and existing methods either require extensive human input or large annotated sets, hindering practical clinical deployment.

Method: A hybrid approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging the strengths of both to reduce dependence on very large annotated datasets and improve segmentation accuracy on high-resolution fundus images (1024x1024). External validation suggests better generalizability.

Result: Dice coefficient of 89.7% and IoU of 80.01% on 1024x1024 fundus images, outperforming Attention U-Net (Dice 51.3%, IoU 34.2%). Demonstrated better generalizability on external datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model advances precise segmentation of fundus lesions, enabling a more reliable decision-support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis and monitoring, with reduced data requirements and improved annotation efficiency.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Yousef Radwan,Eslam Abdelrahman,Abdulwahab Felemban,Aymen Mir,Nico K. Michiels,Andrew J. Temple,Michael L. Berumen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with fine-grained fish species recognition; the authors propose FishNet++, a large multimodal benchmark with extensive descriptions, key-point annotations, and bounding boxes to enable domain-specific vision-language models for aquatic science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine ecosystem monitoring requires accurate, scalable species identification. The study reveals significant gaps in existing MLLMs for fine-grained marine biology tasks and highlights the need for a rich, domain-specific benchmark.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs on fish species recognition, followed by the construction of FishNet++—a large-scale benchmark providing 35,133 textual descriptions, 706,426 key-point annotations for morphology, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection—to support multimodal learning in this domain.

Result: Top open-source models achieve under 10% accuracy on fine-grained fish species recognition, indicating substantial limitations. FishNet++ offers a comprehensive resource to train and evaluate specialized vision-language models for aquatic science.

Conclusion: Domain-specific data and annotations are essential to advance MLLMs in scientific applications; FishNet++ can catalyze development of accurate, domain-aware models for monitoring marine ecosystems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development
and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing
aquatic science.

*Hakan Emre Gedik,Andrew Martin,Mustafa Munir,Oguzhan Baser,Radu Marculescu,Sandeep P. Chinchali,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-attention-based aggregation (queries from nodes, keys from neighbors) for Vision Graph Networks (AttentionViG) enabling non-local message passing; achieves SOTA on ImageNet-1K with competitive FLOPs and strong transferability to COCO and ADE20K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a versatile, architecture-agnostic aggregation method that captures complex node-neighbor relationships in Vision Graph Networks without requiring bespoke refinements.

Method: Introduce a cross-attention aggregation where node queries attend to neighbor keys, forming the AttentionViG architecture for non-local message passing; evaluate on ImageNet-1K and transfer to downstream tasks (COCO 2017 and ADE20K).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K while maintaining comparable FLOPs to prior ViG architectures; demonstrates strong transferability to object detection and instance segmentation on COCO and semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Conclusion: Cross-attention-based aggregation is effective for Vision Graph Networks, delivering high accuracy with similar computational cost, and AttentionViG provides a competitive, transferable architecture for vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

### [19] [MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of patologies from chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25590)
*Berenice Montalvo-Lezama,Gibran Fuentes-Pineda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaChest provides a large chest X-ray dataset for generalized few-shot, showing transfer learning beats ProtoNet-style meta-learning; more classes per episode and more shots improve accuracy; higher resolutions boost accuracy but require more compute; efficient models can match larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scarce annotated data in medical imaging and the need to learn new classes while leveraging existing knowledge (generalized FSL), and to propose a benchmark (MetaChest) for evaluating such tasks in multi-label settings.

Method: Create MetaChest with 479,215 X-rays from four public databases; partition into a meta-set for standard few-shot tasks; develop an algorithm to generate multi-label episodes; compare a standard transfer learning baseline to an extension of ProtoNet on a range of few-shot multi-label tasks; test varying episode configurations, image resolutions, and model sizes.

Result: Transfer learning outperforms ProtoNet extension across tasks; increasing number of classes per episode and shots improves performance; higher-resolution images yield better accuracy at cost; efficient architectures provide comparable performance with lower resource usage.

Conclusion: Generalized few-shot learning in medical imaging benefits from traditional transfer learning; MetaChest serves as a benchmark; consider resource trade-offs; meta-learning approaches may require task-specific design to match generalized FSL performance.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

### [20] [K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical Image Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25594)
*Bangwei Guo,Yunhe Gao,Meng Ye,Difei Gu,Yang Zhou,Leon Axel,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K-Prism unifies semantic priors, in-context knowledge, and interactive feedback into a single segmentation framework using a dual-prompt MoE decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is fragmented across tasks, modalities, and knowledge sources. Clinicians rely on a combination of anatomical priors, exemplar-based reasoning, and real-time feedback; a flexible framework that integrates these paradigms is needed for robust, cross-task segmentation.

Method: Encode heterogeneous knowledge as a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts specifying what to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating where to attend, routed through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This allows seamless switching between semantic, in-context, and interactive paradigms and enables joint training across diverse tasks without changing architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, and more show state-of-the-art performance in semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed design enables flexible paradigm switching and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural modifications, supporting unified, cross-domain medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

### [21] [GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603)
*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GaussianLens for on-demand, localized high-resolution densification of a low-res 3DGS using sparse high-res ROI observations, enabling detailed ROI reconstruction without full high-res global compute and scalable to 1024×1024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans focus attention on regions of interest and require high detail only in critical areas. Uniform-resolution 3DGS is computationally expensive and scales poorly for high-resolution outputs; per-scene optimization is costly and data-hungry. There is a gap between fast but coarse reconstructions and the need for localized, high-detail RoIs.

Method: GaussianLens is a feed-forward densification network that fuses the initial low-resolution 3DGS with multi-view images. It includes a pixel-guided densification mechanism designed to handle large resolution increases and to densify only the user-specified RoI using sparse high-resolution observations.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in local fine-detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images up to 1024×1024 resolution.

Conclusion: Localized, on-demand densification via GaussianLens effectively augments 3DGS with high-detail RoI reconstruction without incurring the cost of full high-resolution global reconstructions, bridging the gap between fast global recon and expensive per-scene optimization.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark (LMOD) with 32,633 instances across 12 conditions and 5 imaging modalities, designed to evaluate generative MLLMs in ophthalmology. It expands prior work, broadens tasks, and benchmarks 24 SOTA models; initial results show ~58% accuracy on zero-shot disease screening with notable gaps in disease staging; dataset and leaderboard will be publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-threatening eye diseases cause substantial global health burden, and access to specialized care is limited. There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal, generative models in ophthalmology, hindering progress toward scalable AI-assisted screening, diagnosis, and bias assessment.

Method: Extend the LMOD benchmark by expanding the dataset (~50% larger) with more color fundus photography, integrating imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations. Support multiple tasks: binary and multi-class disease diagnosis, severity/staging using international grading standards, and demographic prediction. Conduct a systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs under zero-shot settings.

Result: The dataset comprises 32,633 instances across 12 ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities, enabling tasks such as anatomy recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and demographic prediction. Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy on zero-shot disease screening, with performance notably weaker on challenging tasks like disease staging. The authors plan to publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and a leaderboard to advance ophthalmic AI.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a substantial resource for advancing ophthalmic AI, enabling broad benchmarking of MLLMs across multiple tasks and modalities; while encouraging progress, it also highlights current limitations in staging and the need for robust evaluation, bias assessment, and generalization across imaging modalities.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

### [23] [Anchor-free Cross-view Object Geo-localization with Gaussian Position Encoding and Cross-view Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25623)
*Xingtao Ling,Chenlin Fu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AFGeo, an anchor-free cross-view geo-localization method that directly regresses directional offsets per pixel, enhanced with Gaussian Position Encoding and a Cross-view Object Association Module, achieving SOTA with lightweight design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes anchor-based limitations that constrain localization in cross-view settings and addresses the uncertainty of object position under large view gaps.

Method: Per-pixel prediction of left/right/top/bottom offsets to the ground-truth box; Gaussian Position Encoding to model the query click; Cross-view Object Association Module to relate the same object across viewpoints and leverage surrounding context.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets; robust performance under large cross-view appearance gaps; lightweight with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Anchor-free localization guided by Gaussian Position Encoding and cross-view object associations offers accurate, efficient cross-view geo-localization without predefined anchors.

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

### [24] [Generalized Contrastive Learning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25638)
*Jungsoo Lee,Janghoon Cho,Hyojin Park,Munawar Hayat,Kyuwoong Hwang,Fatih Porikli,Sungha Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL) improves multimodal retrieval by learning a unified representation across image and text modalities without extra dataset curation, boosting existing models on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval models degrade when queries involve fused image-text modalities; curating datasets for new modality combinations is costly and restricts generalization. A unified training signal across modalities can address these gaps.

Method: GCL introduces a cross-modal contrastive loss applied within mini-batches that enforces alignment across all modalities in existing image-caption datasets, producing a shared embedding space without creating new composed datasets.

Result: GCL yields consistent gains for off-the-shelf multimodal retrievers (VISTA, CLIP, TinyCLIP) on M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: GCL offers a scalable, data-efficient approach to generalize multimodal retrieval to arbitrary modality combinations without dataset curation, by learning a unified cross-modal representation.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

*Leandro Arab Marcomini,Andre Luiz Cunha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic truck images from a video game can effectively train YOLO-based detectors for real-world axles, achieving up to 99% mAP; statistical testing (Mann–Whitney U) supports significance; synthetic data offers a low-cost, reliable alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs require large labeled datasets; collecting real data is costly. Synthetic data from video games provides realistic 3D-model images to augment training for truck-axle detection.

Method: Constructed three datasets combining real and synthetic trucks; trained three YOLO architectures on these datasets; evaluated recall, precision, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP); applied Mann–Whitney U test to compare mAP across models.

Result: Synthetic training data improved performance across all YOLO models; the top mAP reached 99%. The synthetic data is a reliable, low-cost data source for training neural networks.

Conclusion: Video-game–generated images can be a viable alternative to real data for training object detectors, enabling accurate truck-axle detection with reduced data collection costs.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

*Kaiyu Li,Zixuan Jiang,Xiangyong Cao,Jiayu Wang,Yuchen Xiao,Deyu Meng,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Geo-DLC for object-level fine-grained remote sensing captioning, with DE-Dataset, DE-Benchmark, and DescribeEarth; the model outperforms general MLLMs on the benchmark; resources released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of current remote sensing captioning that is image-level, lacking fine-grained object-level interpretation, hindering utilization of rich semantic and structural information for applications like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.

Method: Proposes Geo-DLC task; assembles DE-Dataset (25 categories, 261,806 annotated instances with object attributes, relationships, and contexts); develops DE-Benchmark with LLM-assisted QA for systematic evaluation; introduces DescribeEarth, an MLLM architecture with a scale-adaptive focal strategy and a domain-guided fusion module to encode high-resolution details and remote-sensing priors while preserving global context.

Result: DescribeEarth consistently surpasses state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, achieving higher factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding environmental attributes across simple, complex, and out-of-distribution remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: Geo-DLC, DE-Dataset, and DE-Benchmark establish a new direction for object-level captioning in remote sensing, and DescribeEarth demonstrates the practicality of domain-specific MLLMs; data, code, and weights are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

### [27] [YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25659)
*Po-Heng Chou,Chun-Chi Wang,Wei-Lung Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A YOLO-based defect-detection framework augmented with ConSinGAN data generation improves surface and hole defect detection in metal sheets; YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN achieves 91.3% accuracy and 146 ms per image, integrated into hardware/SCADA for practical AOI, with potential applicability to other components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the low availability of metal sheet defect images which harms detection accuracy, and develop a fast, automated AOI system suitable for industrial manufacturing.

Method: Train YOLO-based detectors (v3, v4, v7, v9) on metal-sheet defect data; augment data with ConSinGAN; compare variants; select YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN; implement in manufacturing hardware and SCADA for AOI.

Result: YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN yields 91.3% accuracy and 146 ms detection time, outperforming other variants.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, scalable automated defect detection solution that can be extended to other industrial components, with real-time performance and hardware/SCADA integration.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

### [28] [OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682)
*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-set, few-shot source attribution for AI-generated images using OmniDFA and OmniFake, enabling identification of unseen generators with limited samples and improving detection generalization; introduces large synthetic dataset and shows strong open-set attribution and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle overfitting in AIGI detectors, the scarcity of large-scale synthetic datasets, and the need for robust attribution capable of handling unseen generators in real-world settings.

Method: Propose OmniDFA, a framework that combines detection and few-shot attribution; create OmniFake dataset with 1.17M images from 45 generative models; evaluate open-set attribution and few-shot identification; code to be released.

Result: OmniDFA achieves state-of-the-art generalization for AIGI detection and excels in open-set attribution on unseen generators; OmniFake provides a large, curated resource.

Conclusion: Open-set, few-shot attribution is practical for real-world AIGI scenarios; the proposed dataset and framework advance detection and attribution, enabling robust identification of synthesis origins with limited samples.

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

### [29] [AIMCoT: Active Information-driven Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25699)
*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT proposes an active, information-driven multimodal Chain-of-Thought framework that outperforms prior methods by actively selecting visual information and dynamically structuring reasoning via three components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal CoT methods rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., attention maps) and passive, arbitrary information triggering, which can be unreliable for multimodal reasoning; there is a need for proactive, information-theoretic strategies to guide when and what visual data to incorporate.

Method: AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1) Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG) to mitigate text-vision granularity imbalance and produce more reliable attention maps; (2) Active Visual Probing (AVP) to proactively select image regions that maximize information gain; (3) Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT) to determine optimal moments to insert visual information by monitoring text-to-vision attention shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that AIMCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings.

Conclusion: AIMCoT advances robust, effective, and human-like multimodal reasoning by actively foraging for information and dynamically structuring the reasoning process; code is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [30] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memorization in diffusion models stems from early overestimation during denoising, not merely overfitting; memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions, collapsing latent trajectories toward memorized samples and reducing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and copyright concerns by understanding the fundamental mechanism of memorization in diffusion models.

Method: Analyze diffusion/denoising process by examining latent space dynamics, decompose intermediate latents, and relate deviations from the denoising schedule to memorization; study effects of classifier-free guidance on training loss under memorization; combine theoretical analysis with empirical observations of how training images influence noise predictions.

Result: Early overestimation is identified as central; memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone; memorized prompts cause memorized images to be injected into noise predictions, steering denoising toward paired samples; latent decomposition shows initial randomness is rapidly replaced by memorized content; deviations in the denoising schedule correlate with memorization severity; memorization reduces diversity and collapses trajectories.

Conclusion: Understanding memorization as early overestimation clarifies the mechanism and suggests defenses should target early denoising dynamics and guidance signals; results provide a foundation for mitigating memorization in diffusion models.

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

### [31] [ProbMed: A Probabilistic Framework for Medical Multimodal Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25711)
*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED introduces probabilistic (distributional) embeddings for four medical modalities to address many-to-many mappings; uses InfoNCE with Hellinger distance and a probabilistic synthetic sampling loss; achieves improved cross-modality retrieval, zero-/few-shot classification, and prognostication across 13 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Medical Vision-Language Pretraining Models (Med-VLPMs) rely on deterministic embeddings and typically assume one-to-one or simple mappings between modalities, which inadequately capture the complex, many-to-many relationships in medical data and narratives.

Method: A multimodal Med-VLPM (ProbMED) that learns distributions over embeddings for chest X-rays, ECGs, echocardiograms, and clinical text. Uses probabilistic contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss guided by Hellinger distance to align inter-modality distributions. Introduces a probabilistic synthetic sampling loss to model modality-specific mean and variance for stronger intra-modality binding, aiming to unify four modalities in a probabilistic embedding space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art Med-VLPMs on 13 medical datasets in cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification tasks. Demonstrates robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication with improved intra- and inter-modality binding.

Conclusion: ProbMED demonstrates that modeling embeddings as distributions rather than points yields stronger cross-modal alignment and predictive performance in multimodal medical contexts, suggesting probabilistic, distributional learning as a promising direction for Med-VLPMs and multi-modal medical decision support.

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic-aware, multi-negative DPO framework (MISP-DPO) using Plackett-Luce and CLIP-space negatives to improve multimodal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal direct preference optimization relies on a single negative example, often produced via perturbations or retrieval, which cannot capture the rich, diverse preferences in vision-language data and can induce bias and hallucinations.

Method: Embed prompts and candidate images in CLIP space, apply a sparse autoencoder to extract interpretable semantic deviation factors, and build negative samples based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from the positive, and mutual diversity. For multi-negative comparisons, use a Plackett-Luce objective with an importance sampling strategy to improve training efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation across five benchmarks shows consistent improvements in multimodal alignment over prior methods, validating the benefit of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse semantic negatives via Plackett-Luce in multimodal DPO yields stronger alignment and reduces bias, and the approach is broadly applicable to multimodal preference learning.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE introduces a Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration framework for VPR, jointly learning local feature aggregation, sampling, and hard mining during training. It uses a Soft Probing module to weight patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, reconstructs an online geo-visual graph that blends geographic proximity with current visual similarity, and employs anchored cluster seeding with greedy weighted clique expansion to focus on informative neighborhoods. With a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks, including 98.9/95.8/94.5/96.0 Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, Nordland, and 100% Recall@10 on SPED with 4096D descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglected dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training for VPR. Prior methods tune descriptors or sampling strategies but ignore how geographic proximity and visual embedding co-evolve, limiting granular spatial-visual discrimination.

Method: A unified training pipeline: 1) Soft Probing module learns residual weights for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation to emphasize distinctive local cues. 2) An online geo-visual graph fused from geographic proximity and current visual similarity to reflect evolving embeddings. 3) Anchor-based cluster seeding with greedy weighted clique expansion to concentrate learning on informative neighborhoods. 4) Frozen DINOv2 backbone with parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks, including Recall@1: SPED 98.9%, Pitts30k-test 95.8%, MSLS-val 94.5%, Nordland 96.0%; 100% Recall@10 on SPED with 4096D global descriptors; code/modeI will be released.

Conclusion: Joint spatial-visual training with adaptive graph exploration and soft patch weighting substantially boosts granular VPR discrimination while maintaining efficiency, setting new SOTA results and demonstrating effective utilization of a frozen backbone with lightweight fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

### [34] [LaTo: Landmark-tokenized Diffusion Transformer for Fine-grained Human Face Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25731)
*Zhenghao Zhang,Ziying Zhang,Junchao Liao,Xiangyu Meng,Qiang Hu,Siyu Zhu,Xiaoyun Zhang,Long Qin,Weizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo is a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing, introducing a landmark tokenizer, location-mapping positional encoding, and a landmark predictor with vision-language chain-of-thought; it introduces HFL-150K and reports improvements over SOTA in identity preservation and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based face editing struggles with precise attribute control and identity preservation. Rigid landmark constraints degrade identity under large expression/pose changes and with inaccurate estimates; a flexible geometry-appearance interaction and a larger, real-world dataset are needed.

Method: Key components include (1) a landmark tokenizer that quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete tokens; (2) location-mapping positional encoding that fuses facial and image tokens for unified processing and decoupled geometry-appearance interactions; (3) a landmark predictor leveraging vision-language models to infer target landmarks from instructions and source images, using structured chain-of-thought; plus a dataset (HFL-150K) and a diffusion transformer framework LaTo.

Result: LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by about 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency on relevant benchmarks; extensive experiments validate effectiveness, efficiency, and strong identity preservation; the authors also introduce a large real-face-pairs dataset (HFL-150K).

Conclusion: LaTo enables fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing with flexible geometry-appearance interactions, leveraging landmark-tokenization and a vision-language guided landmark predictor; it contributes a large-scale dataset and promises publicly available code and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: CGFSeg effectively addresses challenging VOS scenarios in complex real-world videos, demonstrating strong segmentation accuracy and robustness; approach shows potential for real-world VOS deployment and further improvements through multi-model fusion and targeted calibration.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term

remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting

### [36] [LieHMR: Autoregressive Human Mesh Recovery with $SO(3)$ Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25739)
*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an SO(3) diffusion model for human mesh recovery (HMR) that models the distribution of pose parameters (3D rotations) conditioned on a single image. It uses a time-independent transformer to obtain joint latent vectors and a small MLP denoiser, aiming to produce accurate pose distributions and better capture multi-modality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMR from a single RGB image is ill-posed, leading to multiple plausible poses. Deterministic models ignore ambiguity; existing probabilistic methods often trade off accuracy for diversity and underperform deterministic state-of-the-art. A distribution aligned with 2D observations and structured by joints could better capture uncertainty.

Method: Propose an SO(3) diffusion model over 3D rotations to represent pose parameters, learned both unconditionally and conditioned on image observations via conditioning dropout. Leverages a transformer to learn the hierarchical joint structure, using a time-independent transformer to extract joint latent vectors and a small MLP-based denoiser to learn per-joint distributions conditioned on the latent vector. Training optimizes diffusion objectives on the rotation manifold.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the model effectively predicts accurate pose probability distributions and analyzes how well the distribution aligns with the 2D observations, indicating improved handling of multi-modality compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled probabilistic framework for HMR that explicitly models pose uncertainty conditioned on image data, using SO(3) diffusion and a transformer-based joint hierarchy to capture multi-modal pose distributions with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

### [37] [Dragging with Geometry: From Pixels to Geometry-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25740)
*Xinyu Pu,Hongsong Wang,Jie Gui,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-guided drag-based editor that fuses 3D cues with 2D priors to deliver coherent, high-fidelity image edits in one pass, addressing discontinuities and multi-point conflicts with a unified displacement field and a conflict-free partitioning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drag-based image editing often relies on 2D pixel information and neglects 3D geometry, leading to imprecise edits in geometry-intensive tasks. There is a need to integrate 3D geometric cues and isolate editing regions to maintain consistency across edits.

Method: GeoDrag introduces a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, plus a conflict-free partitioning strategy to isolate editing regions. This enables coherent, high-fidelity editing in a single forward pass during drag interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios demonstrate improved precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The authors also release code at the given GitHub URL.

Conclusion: GeoDrag effectively integrates 3D geometric cues and region isolation to achieve coherent, structure-consistent edits with improved precision in a single forward pass, addressing key limitations of prior drag-based methods.

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

### [38] [IPDRecon: Image-Plane Geometric Decoding for View-Invariant Indoor Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25744)
*Mingyang Li,Yimeng Fan,Changsong Liu,Tianyu Zhou,Xin Wang,Yanyan Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPDRecon decodes 3D structure from 2D images using Pixel-level Confidence Encoding, Affine Compensation, and Image-Plane Spatial Decoding to reduce reliance on inter-view geometry. It preserves edges/textures and is robust to reduced view density, achieving stable indoor reconstructions on ScanNetV2 with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current volume-based indoor reconstruction relies on inter-view geometric constraints from multi-view ray back-projections. The performance degrades with lower view density and in unobserved/overlapping regions. There is a need to exploit rich spatial information within individual views to improve robustness and generalization.

Method: Propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework consisting of three components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). The framework decodes 3D structure encoded in 2D images through the physics of imaging to preserve geometric features (edges, hollows, textures) and enhance view-invariant reconstruction.

Result: On ScanNetV2, IPDRecon demonstrates superior reconstruction stability, maintaining nearly identical quality when the view count is reduced by 40%. Quantitatively, it achieves a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.24%, a performance retention rate of 99.7%, and a maximum performance drop of 0.42%.

Conclusion: Exploiting intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited scenarios in practical indoor reconstruction; IPDRecon offers superior stability and robustness against reduced view density.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

*Siddhant Sukhani,Yash Bhardwaj,Riya Bhadani,Veer Kejriwal,Michael Galarnyk,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-only cues are highly informative for financial short-form video captioning; adding audio and transcripts often introduces noise, with selective two-modality pairs (TV/AV) sometimes outperforming the full three-modality setup (TAV). The work provides the first baselines for this task and releases dataset/code under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to benchmark multimodal reasoning for topic-aligned captioning in financial short-form videos, where visual context (emotions, gestures) and financial entities must be reliably grounded.

Method: Evaluate seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) on 624 annotated YouTube SVs across five topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual analysis, and financial entity recognition.

Result: Video alone performs well on four of five topics; selective two-modality pairs (TV or AV) often outperform the full TAV setup, suggesting too many modalities can introduce noise; established baselines for financial SV captioning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates both potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in finance; provides first baselines and releases code/data for community use under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

TL;DR: Dolphin v1.0 and Dolphin R1 are large-scale multimodal ultrasound foundation models that unify classification, detection, regression, and report generation in a single vision-language framework; built on a 2M-scale dataset; trained via domain-specific pretraining, instruction alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement; R1 adds ultrasound-specific reinforcement learning to improve reasoning and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on U2-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound challenges include operator dependence, image noise, variability, and the need for real-time, robust AI tools; existing general multimodal models struggle with ultrasound complexity, motivating a dedicated, scalable, multimodal ultrasound foundation model.

Method: Three-stage training: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement; data: 2M-scale multimodal dataset combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora; architecture: unified vision-language framework; R1 uses reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards to boost diagnostic reasoning and interpretability.

Result: Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835 on eight ultrasound tasks, more than 2× the second-best 0.2968, establishing new SOTA; Dolphin v1.0 shows competitive performance; reasoning-enhanced training improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Reasoning-driven alignment and specialized, large-scale multimodal ultrasound models can deliver robust perception, generalization, and actionable interpretability, advancing AI-assisted ultrasound in high-stakes clinical settings.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,

medical AI.

### [41] [ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749)
*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON introduces a measurement-guided diffusion framework for virtual try-on that preserves identity/background, removes boundary artifacts, and improves fidelity by formulating VITON as a linear inverse problem and enforcing data consistency through residual-prior initialization and artifact-free sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving non-try-on regions during VITON is challenging with latent diffusion models; post-hoc replacement yields boundary artifacts; a coherent, artifact-free integration that maintains background and identity is needed.

Method: Reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and use trajectory-aligned solvers to progressively enforce measurement consistency. Introduce residual-prior initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and employ artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising.

Result: Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 show ART-VITON preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Measurement-guided diffusion with residual priors is effective for VITON, enabling artifact-free, coherent synthesis and improved robustness; the approach shows strong potential for VITON and related image synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [42] [Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Preference Image Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25771)
*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text Preference Optimization (TPO) enables “free-lunch” alignment of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models without paired image preference data by training models to prefer prompts that match captions over perturbed, mismatched prompts generated via a large language model. It extends existing preference methods (DPO and KTO) to TDPO and TKTO, and shows improved human-preference scores and alignment; code is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based T2I models struggle with text–image alignment. RLHF-based approaches rely on costly, high-quality human annotations (paired preference data or reward models), limiting scalability. A data-efficient, scalable alternative is highly desirable.

Method: Create matched/mismatched prompt pairs by perturbing original captions with a large language model. Train the T2I model to prefer matched prompts over their perturbed counterparts, integrating with existing preference-based algorithms. Extend DPO and KTO to TDPO and TKTO, respectively, yielding a general, compatible framework for text alignment without paired preference data.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that TDPO and TKTO consistently outperform the original DPO and KTO baselines, achieving better human preference scores and improved text–image alignment.

Conclusion: Text Preference Optimization provides a scalable, data-efficient path to align T2I models with human preferences without requiring paired image preference data, and its TDPO/TKTO variants extend current preference-based methods for broader applicability; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

### [43] [V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25773)
*Zhengpeng Shi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Jianqun Zhou,Yuxuan Wang,Qinrong Cui,Wei Bi,Songchun Zhu,Bo Zhao,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: v-HUB is a visual-centric video humor benchmark for multimodal LLMs; results show current models struggle to infer humor from visuals alone; incorporating audio helps; includes caption matching, humor explanations, and open-ended video QA; valuable for diagnosing humor understanding in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to advance evaluation of humor understanding in multimodal models, specifically for visual cues, and to quantify how audio and richer modalities affect humor comprehension.

Method: built a visual-first humor dataset (v-HUB) from minimally verbal videos, annotated with captions, descriptions, and explanations; defined tasks such as caption matching and humor explanation, plus an open-ended video QA task; evaluated various Video-LLMs and OmniLLMs across open-source and proprietary platforms; tested with and without audio.

Result: MLLMs struggle with humor understanding from visual cues alone; performance drops on caption matching when shifting from text-based to video-based evaluation without audio; adding audio improves performance, highlighting the value of multimodal signals.

Conclusion: Visual-only humor understanding remains challenging for current MLLMs; incorporating audio and richer modalities is promising; v-HUB provides a practical benchmark for diagnosing and improving humor-capable AI models.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [44] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO) fixes unstable credit assignment in policy-gradient training for recursive text-to-image generation by reweighting timesteps and reformulating the objective, yielding faster convergence and higher-quality images, and reducing model collapse, outperforming baselines like DanceGRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In recursive T2I generation with policy gradients, feedback signals across timesteps are highly volatile and non-proportional due to the sampling process, causing high variance, instability, slow convergence, and degraded image quality. Aligning training signals with actual contribution of each timestep could stabilize learning.

Method: Introduce PCPO which enforces proportional credit assignment via a stable objective reformulation and principled reweighting of timesteps. Likely mathematical formulation to ensure credits scale with timestep relevance, reducing variance and encouraging consistent gradient signals. Possibly include theoretical justification and empirical ablations showing stability and improved image quality.

Result: Empirical results show significantly accelerated convergence, higher image quality, lower variance, and reduced mode collapse compared to standard policy gradient baselines, including DanceGRPO, across multiple tests/datasets.

Conclusion: Proportionate credit assignment is a potent principle for recursive generative models trained with policy gradients, enabling stable optimization and superior outputs; PCPO offers a general framework and set of techniques applicable beyond T2I, with promising avenues for future work.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion) searches for optimal noise maps to balance content preservation with editability in text-guided diffusion editing, outperforming prior inversions on both image and video editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous inversion methods faithfully reconstruct the source image but limit edit flexibility, while aggressive edits risk losing content. There is a need for inversions that enable both faithful reconstruction and faithful prompt-driven edits.

Method: Introduce ENM Inversion: jointly optimize noise maps to maximize editability while preserving content. Develop editable noise refinement that minimizes the difference between reconstructed noise maps and edited noise maps guided by the target prompt. Analyze noise-map properties to inform the refinement. Demonstrate improvements across image editing tasks and extendability to video editing with temporal consistency.

Result: ENM Inversion achieves superior preservation and edit fidelity across a wide range of editing tasks compared to existing methods, with robust performance for target prompts. The approach can be applied to video editing, enabling consistent edits across frames.

Conclusion: ENM Inversion provides a controllable and effective inversion strategy for diffusion-based editing, enhancing both fidelity to the original content and responsiveness to target prompts, and extends naturally to video for temporally consistent editing.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality is a self-supervised framework that enhances vision-language model (VLM) quality assessment without labels by using pairwise majority voting to create pseudo-rankings and training via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), yielding strong zero-shot performance and competitive results with supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on costly human-annotated data to improve VLMs for perceptual tasks like image quality assessment (IQA), and adapt self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA.

Method: Generate pseudo-labels by pairwise majority voting over the VLM's outputs to form relative quality rankings; convert these into fidelity rewards; iteratively evolve the model via group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to refine perceptual judgments.

Result: Zero-shot PLCC improves by 31.8% across diverse IQA benchmarks; self-supervised EvoQuality is competitive with, or surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming them on 5 of 7 benchmarks.

Conclusion: EvoQuality demonstrates that self-supervised, iterative self-consistency grounded in pairwise voting can effectively enhance perceptual IQA in VLMs without ground-truth labels, narrowing or beating supervised baselines.

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG proposes a probabilistic student–teacher framework that distills ECHO knowledge into ECG representations to predict ECHO-relevant cardiac function, using uncertainty-aware embeddings and cross-modal distillation, and shows improved zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with uncertainty insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG is inexpensive and ubiquitous, but predicting ECHO-level cardiac function from ECG requires bridging modalities. The authors aim to leverage probabilistic cross-modal embeddings and vision-language ECHO data to bring ECHO-style predictions to ECG. Uncertainty estimation is used to understand model reliability.

Method: A probabilistic student–teacher model (EchoingECG) that combines Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++) with ECHO-CLIP to distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. The approach emphasizes uncertainty estimation and uses ECHO supervision for ECG-based predictions of cardiac function.

Result: EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO-related predictions from ECG. External validation supports generalizability. Variance estimation highlights regions of uncertainty and aids interpretation.

Conclusion: The method enhances ECG-based predictions of ECHO-relevant cardiac function while providing uncertainty estimates to improve interpretability; the authors provide code for replication.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

*Haotian Xue,Yunhao Ge,Yu Zeng,Zhaoshuo Li,Ming-Yu Liu,Yongxin Chen,Jiaojiao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIO presents a hierarchical, three-stage benchmark (S1: object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, S3: visual trace prediction) to assess embodied reasoning in Vision-Language Models via precise grounding across indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation domains. Across 10+ state-of-the-art VLMs, strong general models (e.g., GPT-4o) excel in language/reasoning but underperform in precise grounding compared to some open-source models; MoLMO performs well in S1/S2 but struggles in S3, highlighting the need to integrate grounding with path/trace planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied-reasoning benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions anchored to image annotations, which do not rigorously test precise visual grounding or the ability to produce actionable traces. There is a need for a rigorous, domain-diverse benchmark that probes grounding, pointing, and trace-based planning to reveal gaps in VLMs' embodied reasoning.

Method: Introduce Point-It-Out (PIO) with a three-stage hierarchical protocol: S1 referred-object localization (identify the object referred to in the scene), S2 task-driven pointing (point or indicate the relevant region/object for a task), and S3 visual trace prediction (generate a sequence of visual traces/points that would lead to the solution). Data are collected from indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation domains. Evaluate 10+ state-of-the-art VLMs on all stages and analyze performance trends across models and stages.

Result: Empirical results show heterogeneous capabilities: high-performing general models achieve strong language, perception, and reasoning but lag in precise grounding; GPT-4o underperforms relative to some open-source models in grounding tasks; MoLMO attains solid performance in S1 and S2 but fails in S3 due to the need for combined grounding and visual-trace planning.

Conclusion: PIO provides a systematic, scalable framework to scrutinize embodied reasoning in VLMs, revealing current gaps in grounding and trace-based planning. The benchmark motivates future work on integrating robust visual grounding with actionable trace planning and cross-domain evaluation to push embodied intelligence forward.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

*Xintong Jiang,Yixue Liu,Mohamed Debbagh,Yu Tian,Valerio Hoyos-Villegas,Viacheslav Adamchuk,Shangpeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSGA with LoRA enables parameter-efficient adaptation of SAM for agricultural CV under data scarcity, achieving superior few-shot segmentation and pod counting with only 4.00M trainable params (4.26% of SAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT of foundation models for agricultural computer vision is hampered by limited training data and complex field conditions; there is a need for efficient adaptation techniques to accurately segment small, dense objects in crops.

Method: Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) builds a learnable polynomial-decay initialized weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation to form a robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation, using only 4.00M trainable parameters (≈4.26% of SAM); integrated with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for complementary optimization that captures local and global dependencies in embeddings.

Result: DSGA+LoRA outperforms baseline SAM fine-tuning on a chickpea pod dataset across 2/4/8/10 shots, with progressive gains as shots increase; quantitative metrics report 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure over SAM fine-tuning; ablations and Grad-CAM/t-SNE analyses validate improved feature discrimination; pod-counting on 10–120 pods under challenging field conditions achieves an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptation provides a practical, parameter-efficient pathway to robustly adapt large foundation models like SAM for agricultural monitoring tasks, enabling accurate pod segmentation and counting in complex field environments.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

*Zichen Liang,Jingjing Fei,Jie Wang,Zheming Yang,Changqing Li,Pei Wu,Minghui Qiu,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Logo-VGR reframes open-world logo recognition as a comparison-based task, enabling large-scale brand recognition with limited supervision and strong generalization to unseen logos via domain-specific multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models tend to memorize brand distributions and struggle to generalize to unseen brands; domain-specific logo recognition for product moderation is underexplored and requires scalable supervision with open-world data.

Method: Formulate logo recognition as matching product images with candidate logos (instead of generating brand labels) and introduce two domain-specific modules: Logo Perception Grounding (injecting domain knowledge) and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning (enhancing multimodal reasoning).

Result: Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by ~10 points in out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating improved generalization to unseen brands.

Conclusion: A domain-specific multimodal reasoning framework for logo recognition achieves robust generalization in open-world, scalable brand recognition and has strong potential for real-world product moderation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

### [51] [Benchmarking Egocentric Visual-Inertial SLAM at City Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26639)
*Anusha Krishnan,Shaohui Liu,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Oscar Gentilhomme,David Caruso,Maurizio Monge,Richard Newcombe,Jakob Engel,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a new egocentric visual-inertial SLAM dataset and benchmark with centimeter-accurate city-scale ground truth, revealing robustness gaps in current state-of-the-art systems and offering tracks of varying difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM benchmarks do not capture egocentric challenges such as diverse motions, dynamic content, and long sessions with time-varying calibration. A city-scale, centimeter-accurate ground truth enables realistic evaluation of extreme trajectories.

Method: Record hours and kilometers of egocentric trajectories with glasses-like devices equipped with multi-modal sensors; use surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric and centimeter-accurate at city scale; design tracks with different difficulty levels to facilitate in-depth analysis; evaluate state-of-the-art systems and analyze failure sources.

Result: State-of-the-art academic SLAM systems are not robust to the presented challenges; the paper identifies components responsible for failures; the dataset and benchmark are made publicly available.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a gap for evaluating wearable egocentric SLAM under realistic conditions, enabling robust development and analysis of multi-modal SLAM methods with precise, city-scale ground truth.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale ML competition (GeoLifeCLEF 2023) shows biases of single-positive-label training for multi-label ecological prediction and proposes a combined single/multi-label training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance deep learning for ecological forecasting by integrating high-resolution remote sensing and environmental data to predict plant species composition; address biases from single-label supervision in multi-label tasks.

Method: Organize the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 competition; use a training dataset with 5 million plant observations across Europe and high-/low-resolution predictors to evaluate models on 22k plots; synthesize approaches from participating teams and analyze results, highlighting biases and proposing a learning strategy that combines single and multi-label data.

Result: The study highlights biases in methods fitted to single positive labels when evaluated on multi-label tasks, and presents an effective learning strategy that combines single-label and multi-label data to improve performance.

Conclusion: Multi-label evaluation is crucial for ecological prediction; integrating single-label and multi-label training can mitigate biases and advance state-of-the-art in deep learning with remote sensing for biodiversity.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

*Kazuki Matsuda,Yuiga Wada,Shinnosuke Hirano,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA is a fast, human-aligned automatic metric for evaluating long image captions, built with an LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework, validated on LongCap-Arena, and outperforming existing metrics, even achieving superhuman performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic metrics for image captioning target short captions and fail to scale to long, detailed captions. LLM-based evaluation is slow due to autoregressive inference and early fusion of vision information, hindering practical use.

Method: Introduce VELA within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Develop LongCap-Arena, a benchmark with 7,805 images, human long reference and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments across Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency.

Result: VELA outperforms existing metrics and achieves superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.

Conclusion: VELA plus LongCap-Arena provide an effective, scalable solution for evaluating long captions, addressing latency and alignment with human judgments, and potentially establishing a new standard for long-caption image captioning evaluation.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, reward-guided image editing framework using trajectory optimal control on diffusion models, improving the reward-versus-source-faithfulness trade-off and avoiding reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend reward-guided diffusion guidance to image editing while preserving the source image's semantic content, addressing the gap where training-free methods struggle with fidelity and reward alignment.

Method: Formulate editing as a trajectory optimal control problem where the diffusion model's reverse process is a controllable trajectory starting from the source image; iteratively update adjoint states to steer editing, requiring no training.

Result: Across multiple editing tasks, it outperforms inversion-based training-free baselines, achieving a better balance between maximizing the target reward and maintaining fidelity to the source image, with no reward hacking observed.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective training-free approach for reward-guided image editing, demonstrating strong performance and fidelity while avoiding common pitfalls like reward hacking; it provides a general strategy for editing tasks with diffusion-based generators.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reasoning improves multimodal tasks but can cause visual forgetting; Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) anchors reasoning to visual input, improving grounding and achieving SOTA with VAPO-Thinker-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address visual forgetting in multimodal reasoning, where extended reasoning degrades perceptual grounding in vision-language models, by preserving reliance on visual information while retaining reasoning benefits.

Method: Introduce Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple policy-optimization approach that explicitly guides the reasoning process toward trajectories grounded in visual input; instantiated in a model family culminating in VAPO-Thinker-7B.

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B exhibits stronger reliance on visual information and attains new state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of established vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Anchoring reasoning to visual information mitigates visual forgetting, improving perceptual grounding without sacrificing reasoning capability in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MuSLR, a large benchmark for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logic, showing current SOTA vision-language models struggle and that a modular framework (LogiCAM) that applies formal rules to multimodal inputs yields notable gains; highlights modal misalignment as a key error source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes applications (autonomous driving, medical diagnosis) demand rigorous, deterministic symbolic reasoning from multimodal models. Existing VLMs show limited capabilities in symbolic reasoning when integrating text and images.

Method: Create MuSLR with 1,093 instances across 7 domains (35 atomic logic facts and 976 composite logics, depths 2–9). Evaluate 7 SOTA VLMs; develop LogiCAM, a modular framework that injects formal logical rules into multimodal inputs to improve reasoning, leveraging chain-of-thought prompting. Conduct a comprehensive error analysis.

Result: GPT-4.1 achieves 46.8% accuracy on MuSLR. LogiCAM improves GPT-4.1’s Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, with larger gains on first-order logic. About 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities. Data and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: Current SOTA models struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning; modular, rule-based frameworks like LogiCAM can enhance performance and provide insights to guide future work. The MuSLR dataset and analyses offer a benchmark and diagnostic for this task.

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchEAD offers a training-free, patch-based anomaly detection framework that unifies diverse foundation models through visual prompts (alignment + foreground masking), achieving strong few-shot and batch zero-shot performance without relying on textual prompts and providing guidance on backbone choices for industrial visual inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation of visual processing steps across different foundation models and the heavy reliance on text prompts in industrial anomaly detection, by delivering a unified, calibration-light, training-free solution.

Method: Introduce PatchEAD, a patch-focused framework that uses visual prompting techniques including an alignment module and foreground masking to unify anomaly detection across models. It operates training-free and evaluates how backbone structure and pretraining affect patch-similarity robustness, with experiments in few-shot and batch zero-shot regimes.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in few-shot and batch zero-shot settings compared to prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Provides insights on how backbone design and pretraining affect patch-similarity robustness and offers practical guidance for selecting/configuring foundation models for real-world visual inspection.

Conclusion: A well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light deployment for industrial anomaly detection without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hardware-agnostic framework that fuses multiple cameras with a mechanical LiDAR to produce real-time, colorised 360-degree point clouds, robust in low-light due to integrated low-light enhancement and color correction; it auto-calibrates extrinsics without dedicated targets, enabling streamlined setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D scene understanding with robust colorisation across wide coverage while reducing setup complexity, especially under low illumination where traditional methods fail.

Method: Integrates a low-light image enhancement module into a multi-camera–LiDAR fusion pipeline. Starts with intrinsic camera calibration, then automatically computes the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and cameras (no special calibration targets). Applies color correction across camera feeds before fusion to ensure consistency; outputs colorised point clouds with full 360-degree coverage. Demonstrated with a Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and four cameras, achieving real-time performance.

Result: Real-time colorisation of LiDAR data into colorised point clouds; robust performance under very low illumination with the ability to recover scene details that are otherwise undetectable.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, hardware-agnostic solution for colorising LiDAR with camera data over complete 360-degree coverage, maintaining performance in low light and simplifying setup by removing the need for calibration targets.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

*Junjie Zhou,Wei Shao,Yagao Yue,Wei Mu,Peng Wan,Qi Zhu,Daoqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE is a hierarchical prompt-learning framework for few-shot WSI classification that integrates multi-scale entity-level and slide-level prompts. It uses LLM-generated prompts to capture histological entities and their attributes, applies entity-guided cross-attention and a cross-scale entity graph to refine representations, and fuses entity- and slide-level predictions for final diagnosis across three cancer cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slide-level prompts alone miss subtype-specific histopathological variations (e.g., nuclei, glands) essential for cancer diagnosis. A multi-scale, entity-aware approach can improve few-shot generalization and annotation efficiency in WSI classification.

Method: 1) Generate entity-level prompts and slide-level prompts via large language models to describe multi-scale histological entities and global visual features. 2) Use an entity-guided cross-attention module to produce entity-level features and align them with subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained predictions. 3) Employ a cross-scale entity graph to update representations across and within scales. 4) Aggregate refined entity representations into a slide-level representation and align with slide-level prompts for slide-level prediction. 5) Fuse entity-level and slide-level outputs for the final prediction.

Result: The approach yields improved performance on few-shot pathology tasks across three cancer cohorts, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating multi-scale, entity-aware prompts and cross-scale relational reasoning.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides a robust, end-to-end framework for few-shot WSI classification that leverages LLM-driven prompts, cross-attention, and cross-scale graphs to capture histology-level phenotypes and enhance generalization.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: DeepSketcher presents a dataset and a self-contained model enabling interleaved image-text reasoning with native “visual thoughts” in embedding space, showing strong multimodal reasoning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the shift from text-dominant chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning in vision-language models, aiming for finer-grained, more faithful multimodal reasoning; acknowledges gaps in data quality, architectural design, and broader applicability.

Method: Dataset: 31k chain-of-thought trajectories with diverse tool calls and edited images, high annotation accuracy. Model: interleaved image-text reasoning that generates visual thoughts directly in visual embedding space, eliminating reliance on external tools and repeated image encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the dataset utility and the effectiveness of the model design.

Conclusion: The work advances the thinking-with-images paradigm by providing a valuable dataset and a tool-free model architecture, with opportunities to broaden data construction, structure, and application scenarios.

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

*Arvind Murari Vepa,Yannan Yu,Jingru Gan,Anthony Cuturrufo,Weikai Li,Wei Wang,Fabien Scalzo,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-conditioned, hierarchical mixture-of-experts LLM (mpLLM) for 3D brain mpMRI VQA, using modality- and token-level experts with synthetic VQA and clinical validation; achieves +5.3% over baselines and introduces a clinically validated mpMRI VQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited image-text supervision in medical VQA and enable effective fusion of multiple interrelated 3D modalities without image-report pretraining; provide a clinically validated dataset and a testbed for multimodal LLM in mpMRI.

Method: Proposes mpLLM with a hierarchical MoE routing across modality-level and token-level projection experts to fuse interrelated mpMRI modalities; employs synthetic VQA generation from segmentation annotations; collaborates with medical experts for clinical validation; code and dataset release planned.

Result: Outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across mpMRI datasets; ablation studies show the necessity of modality- and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing; introduction of a clinically validated 3D mpMRI VQA dataset; dataset and code to be released.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the
supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defines multimodal multi-turn dialogue safety, introduces MMDS dataset and Monte Carlo Tree Search–based red-teaming, and presents LLaVAShield for detection and risk assessment; reports strong results and will release resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As vision-language models move into interactive, multi-turn settings with imagery, safety risks can spread across turns and modalities, making single-turn or single-modality moderation insufficient.

Method: First define MMT dialogue safety; construct the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset (4,484 annotated samples with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales); develop an automated red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues; build LLaVAShield to jointly detect and assess risk in user inputs and assistant responses.

Result: MMDS enables robust evaluation of MMT safety; LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and adapts to dynamic policy configurations, achieving state-of-the-art results; dataset and model will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Provides the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety, along with a dataset and an automated red-teaming framework; introduces LLaVAShield for joint risk detection and assessment, advancing safe deployment of multimodal interactive systems and enabling future research.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

*Peng Liu,Haozhan Shen,Chunxin Fang,Zhicheng Sun,Jiajia Liao,Tiancheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-FO1 is a plug-and-play framework that turns fine-grained visual grounding into a robust feature retrieval task using a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder, enabling LLM-based grounding without sacrificing general VLM ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level VLMs excel at scene understanding but struggle with precise localization due to difficulty in generating exact coordinates; a robust grounding mechanism is needed to bridge high-level reasoning with fine-grained visual regions.

Method: Integrates with pre-trained VLMs via a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE) with a dual vision encoder to produce rich region tokens, and a token-based referencing system that lets the LLM ground language to specific visual regions. It is a plug-and-play module and uses a two-stage training strategy to preserve the base model’s general capabilities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks for object grounding, region generation understanding, and visual region reasoning, while maintaining the base VLM’s general visual understanding.

Conclusion: VLM-FO1 demonstrates an effective, flexible paradigm for perception-aware VLMs that bridges high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding using robust region-centric representations and token-based grounding.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

### [64] [The Impact of Scaling Training Data on Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25927)
*Marco Zimmerli,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaling helps robustness but data quality and training objectives matter more than sheer scale; curated/self-supervised models can beat larger but less curated models; a logarithmic scaling law governs robustness with data and model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data characteristics, model types, and training paradigms affect adversarial robustness across a wide range of vision models and datasets.

Method: Evaluate 36 state-of-the-art vision models (supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive) trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images against six black-box attack categories (random perturbations, two geometric masks, COCO manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts) and analyze robustness scaling.

Result: Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate by ~3.2%; a tenfold increase in model size reduces ARS by ~13.4%. Some self-supervised models on curated data (e.g., DINOv2) outperform larger but less curated models. Adversarial fine-tuning improves generalization across structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision.

Conclusion: Scale alone is insufficient for broad-spectrum adversarial resilience; data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a decisive role, with curated/self-supervised approaches and targeted fine-tuning offering notable benefits over raw scale.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

### [65] [UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via MoE-Driven Feature Decompression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25934)
*Yuan Zhao,Youwei Pang,Lihe Zhang,Hanqi Liu,Jiaming Zuo,Huchuan Lu,Xiaoqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD is a unified MoE-based approach for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection that uses a general-to-specific encoding, sparsely gated cross MoE for decoding, and MoE-in-MoE to adapt reconstruction across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with substantial parameter savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat modality and class as independent factors, leading to fragmented solutions and high memory overhead. Reconstruction-based multi-class methods with shared decoders struggle with large domain variations, causing distorted normality boundaries and high false alarm rates. A unified, efficient framework is needed to address these issues.

Method: Introduce Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression with a general-to-specific paradigm. Encoding compresses varying modality combinations into general features; a feature compression module suppresses latent anomalies, promotes cross-modal interaction, and avoids shortcut learning. Decoding uses sparsely-gated cross MoE to produce modality-specific and class-specific representations. Additional mechanisms include grouped dynamic filtering and a MoE-in-MoE structure to reduce parameters (about 75% fewer) while maintaining sparse activation and fast inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes. Reports substantial parameter reduction (≈75%) with maintained performance; source code will be available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: UniMMAD offers a unified, efficient framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection, enabling adaptive reconstruction across domains with reduced memory footprint while achieving strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

### [66] [CO3: Contrasting Concepts Compose Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25940)
*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CO3 provides a plug-and-play corrective sampling method to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in diffusion models, reducing imbalance and missing concepts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-concept prompts (e.g., 'a cat and a dog') often produce images where one concept is underrepresented, missing, or conflicts with others due to drifting into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept learned during training. Existing multi-concept guidance can also operate in unstable regimes, amplifying imbalance.

Method: Introduce a corrective sampling strategy (CO3) that steers sampling away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept. Identify favorable sampling regions (pure joint modes) where concepts coexist with balanced visual presence, and adapt sampling to stay within them. CO3 is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements standard classifier-free guidance.

Result: Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts show improved concept coverage, balance, and robustness, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods.

Conclusion: Lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment in modern diffusion systems, enabling more reliable multi-concept image synthesis without retraining.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SS-ACL is an annotation-free framework for vision-grounded medical report generation that aligns reports with anatomical regions via a hierarchical graph and region-level contrastive learning, enabling interpretable visual grounding without expert labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High labeling costs and pathology distribution bias limit generalizability of current methods; need annotation-free approaches that produce clinically accurate, interpretable reports aligned with anatomy.

Method: Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency Learning (SS-ACL) constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph reflecting top-down anatomical inclusion. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained regions to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment and guides attention maps toward text-prompted regions. Introduces region-level contrastive learning to align embeddings across samples for abnormality recognition. Alignment embeddings serve as priors for report generation, making attention maps interpretable as visual evidence.

Result: Without expert annotations, SS-ACL outperforms state-of-the-art by 10% in lexical accuracy and 25% in clinical efficacy for report generation. It also achieves competitive performance on downstream visual tasks, surpassing leading visual foundation models by 8% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: Annotation-free, interpretable, and effective for vision-grounded medical report generation, with strong generalization to downstream tasks, demonstrating the value of self-supervised anatomical consistency in clinical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

### [68] [A Multi-purpose Tracking Framework for Salmon Welfare Monitoring in Challenging Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25969)
*Espen Uri Høgstedt,Christian Schellewald,Annette Stahl,Rudolf Mester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose-estimation–driven salmon tracking framework enabling robust welfare monitoring in aquaculture; introduces two datasets for ID transfer/switching and tail-beat wavelength; outperforms BoostTrack; code and data available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need continuous, automated welfare indicators for salmon in net pens. Current CV methods focus on single indicators and rely on detectors/trackers, with high resource demands and vulnerability to underwater challenges like occlusion and similar-object appearance. A body-part aware tracking approach could provide more reliable, scalable welfare indicators from high-detail body-part tracks. Datasets and code are provided to support evaluation (GitHub link in paper).

Method: Employ a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and their body parts; develop specialized modules that leverage body-part information to address underwater challenges (occlusion, identity confusion, turning). Use the detailed body-part tracks to compute welfare indicators (e.g., tail-beat analysis). Construct two datasets addressing: (1) salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes, (2) salmon ID switches during turning. Compare against the state-of-the-art pedestrian tracker BoostTrack; also create a dataset for calculating tail-beat wavelength.

Result: The proposed method outperforms BoostTrack on both salmon tracking challenges. The tail-beat wavelength dataset demonstrates the method’s suitability for welfare monitoring based on tail dynamics. Datasets and code are available at the authors’ GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Body-part–aware tracking via pose estimation is effective for automated welfare monitoring in underwater salmon scenes, enabling more accurate and scalable calculation of welfare indicators from high-detail body-part tracks (e.g., tail-beat wavelength). This approach mitigates occlusion and identity issues, supporting practical deployment in industrial aquaculture.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

*Bojun Zhang,Hangjian Ye,Hao Zheng,Jianzheng Huang,Zhengyu Lin,Zhenhong Guo,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PinPoint3D is an interactive framework for fine-grained 3D part segmentation that uses a new 3D data synthesis pipeline to produce a dense, scene-level part-annotated dataset and achieves strong performance with only a few user clicks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods are limited to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse real-world scans and lack annotated data. There is a need for fine-grained, data-efficient 3D part segmentation to enable nuanced manipulation tasks in embodied AI.

Method: Propose PinPoint3D, an interactive framework for multi-granularity 3D segmentation that yields precise part-level masks from few user point clicks. Develop a 3D data synthesis pipeline to generate a large-scale scene-level dataset with dense part annotations. Evaluate with experiments and user studies against baselines.

Result: Achieves about 55.8% IoU on each object part under first-click settings and over 71.3% IoU with a few additional clicks. Outperforms current SOTA baselines by up to 16% in IoU and precision, especially on sparse point clouds and with high efficiency.

Conclusion: PinPoint3D represents a significant step toward more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments, enabling fine-grained manipulation tasks through data-efficient interactive segmentation.

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RH-Partial2Global improves Partial2Global by using a jackknife conformal prediction-guided alternative sets and covering design-based sampling to robustly and comprehensively select in-context examples, outperforming baselines across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods rely on a similarity-priority assumption and use random sampling for pairwise preferences, which can lead to incomplete coverage and inefficiency. There is a need for a reliable, holistic selection of in-context examples.

Method: Introduce RH-Partial2Global: (1) a jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable alternative sets; (2) a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences; (3) integrate these into a global ranking framework for VICL.

Result: Extensive experiments show excellent performance and the method outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global provides reliable, holistic in-context example selection for VICL, addressing coverage and sampling issues inherent in previous methods and demonstrating strong generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VRWKV-Editor, a diffusion-based video editing model that uses a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module via RWKV bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence to achieve linear complexity, enabling faster editing with less memory while preserving quality; outperforms SOTA diffusion-based methods in speed and memory with competitive frame consistency and text alignment, especially on longer videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic computational complexity of traditional self-attention in video editing models hampers scalability to long-duration and high-resolution videos and impedes real-time processing.

Method: Introduce VRWKV-Editor by integrating a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video diffusion models. It leverages the RWKV transformer’s bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence to capture global dependencies with linear complexity while maintaining temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments show up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, with competitive frame consistency and text alignment. The speed gap between this approach and self-attention-based architectures widens as video sequence length increases.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that linear spatio-temporal aggregation via RWKV can replace costly self-attention in diffusion-based video editing, enabling scalable, real-time or long-video editing without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

### [72] [Learning Egocentric In-Hand Object Segmentation through Weak Supervision from Human Narrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26004)
*Nicola Messina,Rosario Leonardi,Luca Ciampi,Fabio Carrara,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Fabrizio Falchi,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly supervise in-hand object segmentation from natural language narrations; a WISH model learns hand–object associations without narrations at test time, achieving notable gains without pixel-wise labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of pixel-level egocentric segmentation data; narrations are cheap, natural supervision available in datasets like EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D.

Method: Introduce NS-iHOS as a task and propose WISH, an end-to-end model that distills knowledge from narrator descriptions to learn hand–object mappings; trained with narrations and used at test time without them; compared against open-vocabulary detectors and vision-language baselines.

Result: WISH outperforms baselines and attains over 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D without fine-grained pixel annotations.

Conclusion: Natural language narrations are a viable source of weak supervision for in-hand object segmentation, enabling scalable, resource-efficient pixel-level egocentric understanding; the approach demonstrates strong transfer from language cues to segmentation.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

*Hanwei Zhu,Yu Tian,Keyan Ding,Baoliang Chen,Bolin Chen,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgenticIQA introduces a modular, planning-based IQA agent that combines vision-language models with traditional IQA tools to produce scores plus explanations, aided by a large-scale dataset and a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IQA is inherently complex, and fixed models struggle to adapt to diverse distortions, user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Scoring and interpretation are interdependent, yet often treated separately.

Method: Proposes four subtasks—distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution—coordinated by a planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific strategies, the executor gathers perceptual evidence via tool invocations, and the summarizer integrates evidence to produce scores with human-aligned explanations. Introduces AgenticIQA-200K for training/evaluation and AgenticIQA-Eval as a benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse IQA datasets show AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Conclusion: AgenticIQA offers a dynamic, interpretable, query-aware IQA framework with accompanying dataset and benchmark, achieving improved performance and human-aligned explanations, and guiding future IQA research.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

### [74] [New Fourth-Order Grayscale Indicator-Based Telegraph Diffusion Model for Image Despeckling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26010)
*Rajendra K. Ray,Manish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that fuses diffusion and wave dynamics to denoise multiplicative noise, outperforming two second-order anisotropic diffusion methods on grayscale and color images (PSNR/MSSIM) and using Speckle Index for SAR. It can be extended to color channels independently while preserving structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order PDEs often produce blocky artifacts and struggle with multiplicative noise; a higher-order approach combining diffusion and wave properties aims to suppress noise while preserving textures.

Method: Introduce a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model with diffusion guided by the Laplacian and intensity, plus a wave-like component to preserve detail; compare against two second-order anisotropic diffusion methods; use PSNR and MSSIM on grayscale data, SI for SAR; extend to color by denoising each channel independently.

Result: The proposed model yields better quantitative metrics than existing models across grayscale and color datasets; for SAR it shows improved noise suppression using SI.

Conclusion: A promising higher-order PDE framework for denoising multiplicative noise that balances noise reduction and texture preservation, outperforming competing second-order methods and extendable to color images.

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

### [75] [SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26012)
*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage SETR method for zero-shot composed image retrieval: coarse intersection-based retrieval to filter irrelevant cues, followed by fine-grained re-ranking with a multimodal LLM (via LoRA) to perform Yes/No semantic relevance judgments; achieves state-of-the-art across CIRR, Fashion-IQ, CIRCO with notable Recall@1 gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-based ZS-CIR methods struggle due to (a) union-based fusion that incorporates distracting background cues, and (b) reliance on global cosine similarity that misses fine-grained relational semantics between the reference image and the modification text. A more discriminative, two-stage approach is needed to filter distractors and verify relational/attribute-level consistency.

Method: Stage 1 (coarse retrieval): intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and the relative text to filter distractors and produce a high-recall candidate set. Stage 2 (fine-grained re-ranking): adapt a pretrained multimodal large language model with Low-Rank Adaptation to perform binary semantic relevance judgments (Yes/No), explicitly checking relational and attribute-level consistency.

Result: SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO, with Recall@1 on CIRR improved by up to 15.15 points, demonstrating strong gains and robustness across datasets.

Conclusion: Two-stage reasoning provides a general, portable paradigm for robust ZS-CIR: coarse intersection-based filtering yields a high-recall candidate set, while a fine-grained Yes/No semantic verifier ensures precise alignment with text edits. The pipeline complements CLIP-style matching and can generalize to other modalities/datasets.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

### [76] [GeoLink: Empowering Remote Sensing Foundation Model with OpenStreetMap Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26016)
*Lubian Bai,Xiuyuan Zhang,Siqi Zhang,Zepeng Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wei Qin,Shihong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink is a multimodal framework that integrates OpenStreetMap (OSM) with remote sensing (RS) foundation models to improve pretraining and downstream tasks. It uses multi-granularity, cross-modal spatial correlations and an image mask-reconstruction pretraining objective to enable sparse input, producing unimodal and multimodal encodings for tasks from land cover to urban zoning. Experiments show improved RS encoder performance and better multimodal adaptability; code and checkpoints are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a modality gap between RS imagery and OSM data (differences in structure, content, and spatial granularity) that hampers effective multimodal learning in geospatial AI. Integrating OSM context with RS data during pretraining and downstream tasks could enhance model understanding of geographic phenomena across a range of tasks.

Method: GeoLink introduces multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data to guide self-supervised pretraining of RS foundation models, leveraging cross-modal spatial correlations for information interaction. It adds an image mask-reconstruction objective to handle sparse inputs during pretraining. For downstream tasks, it produces both unimodal and multimodal encodings to support diverse applications, from land cover classification to urban function zone mapping.

Result: Pretraining with OSM data improves the RS image encoder; fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks improves the model's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. The work highlights the importance of spatial correlation for effective multimodal geospatial data integration and reports that the multimodal approach yields better generalization across geographic contexts.

Conclusion: Multimodal synergy between RS imagery and OSM data can advance high-level geospatial AI by enhancing pretraining and downstream task performance. The spatial correlation of data is crucial for effective integration. The authors release code and checkpoints.

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

### [77] [PatchVSR: Breaking Video Diffusion Resolution Limits with Patch-wise Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26025)
*Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Chang Liu,Xintao Wang,Jing Wang,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchVSR introduces patch-wise video diffusion priors with a dual-stream adapter to enable efficient, high-fidelity VSR that scales to 4K from a 512×512 base model, using patch content features and global context for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-size VSR with full-attention is computationally intensive and often fixed in output resolution. Leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR can reduce cost while maintaining quality.

Method: PatchVSR employs a dual-stream adapter: a patch branch extracts features from input patches for fidelity, and a global branch extracts context from a resized full video to bridge semantic gaps. Patch location information is embedded to contextualize patch synthesis, and a multi-patch joint modulation ensures cross-patch consistency across independently enhanced patches.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level and enables competitive 4K VSR using a 512×512 base model with extremely high efficiency and good cross-patch visual coherence.

Conclusion: PatchVSR demonstrates that video diffusion priors can be effectively adapted for patch-wise VSR, mitigating semantic gaps via global context and patch-location cues, while delivering scalable, efficient 4K results.

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP) to boost OOD generalization by applying spatially varying Gaussian noise guided by soft causal masks from Vision Transformers; yields improvements on Camelyon17 in WILDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD generalization in real-world biomedical imaging is hindered by subtle and pervasive distribution shifts and by reliance on spurious correlations; existing domain-invariance approaches may neglect the causal mechanisms of generalization.

Method: Apply spatially varying Gaussian perturbations to input images; perturbation strength follows a soft causal mask from Vision Transformers, with stronger perturbations in background and weaker in foreground to encourage reliance on causally relevant features; lightweight, avoiding heavy generative/adversarial components.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art OOD baselines on the WILDS Camelyon17 benchmark.

Conclusion: Causally-guided perturbation is a promising, interpretable tool for improving robust OOD generalization by emphasizing causal features over spurious correlations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

### [79] [SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036)
*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge introduces a lightweight Semantic Modality Bridge that maps images into the text embedding space to fix intra-modal misalignment in CLIP, yielding a closed-form, optionally trainable projection (SeMoBridge-T) that improves few-shot performance with reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP excels zero-shot but falters in few-shot tasks due to intra-modal misalignment caused by a persistent modality gap and an exclusively inter-modal training objective, leading to uncalibrated embedding spaces that hinder image-to-image comparisons.

Method: The Semantic Modality Bridge maps images into the text modality while preserving semantic content. It is closed-form and can be optionally trained via multi-modal supervision by combining image- and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.

Result: Training the SeMoBridge-T variant requires only a fraction of training time and outperforms competing methods, especially in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). Code is available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: SeMoBridge offers an efficient solution to intra-modal misalignment in CLIP, yielding strong few-shot performance with reduced training time, and presents a practical approach that can complement or replace heavier optimization methods.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) augments HAMMER to handle global FG-BG inconsistencies by using person/face masks to create region-aware coherence scores, fused with HAMMER's predictions to improve detection, grounding, and explanations with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER excels on standard benchmarks but fails when the main subject is misplaced in an implausible background due to label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground alignment. Global scene inconsistencies require region-aware reasoning.

Method: Apply person/face segmentation masks to separate foreground/background; extract embeddings with a joint vision-language model; compute region-aware coherence scores for FG and BG; fuse these scores with HAMMER's original prediction; inference-only and low overhead; release segmentation/scoring scripts.

Result: Binary detection accuracy, grounding, and token-level explanations are significantly improved; robustness to global manipulations increases; negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Region-aware reasoning is crucial for multimodal disinformation detection; SGS provides a practical plug-in to HAMMER to mitigate FG-BG mismatch without retraining.

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [81] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends the DGM4 dataset with 5,000 examples of foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations to address global inconsistencies in multimodal disinformation, creating DGM4+ and enabling evaluation of detectors on both local and global reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets (DGM4) focus on local manipulations (face swaps, attribute edits, caption changes) and overlook global inconsistencies like mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are common in real-world forgeries. DGM4+ aims to fill this gap and improve evaluation of multimodal detectors on global reasoning.

Method: Generate 5,000 high-quality samples using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 with prompts to produce news-style images where authentic figures appear in absurd backdrops, and captions under three conditions (literal, text attribute, text split) to create FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS categories. Implement quality control: 1–3 visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and realistic headline length. Release dataset and generation script.

Result: Created DGM4+ dataset that introduces FG-BG mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations, complementing DGM4 and enabling evaluation of detectors on both local and global inconsistencies. Cites HAMMER as a model that currently struggles with FG-BG inconsistencies.

Conclusion: DGM4+ strengthens the evaluation framework for multimodal disinformation detection by broadening the manipulated signal space to include global foreground-background inconsistencies, and is released publicly for research use.

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

*Ioana Ciuclea,Giorgio Longari,Alice Barbara Tumpach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-based framework for handling symmetries in classification using sections of principal fiber bundles to mod out symmetries, avoiding data augmentation; demonstrates on object-contour data with translations, rotations, scalings, and reparameterizations; introduces a 2-parameter canonical curve parameterization; provides code and notebook for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision and medical datasets often exhibit symmetries (translation, rotation, scaling, reparameterization) that complicate classification. Data augmentation is common but can be inefficient and not sustainable. The authors seek a principled, geometry-driven method to factor out symmetries and measure dissimilarities between symmetry orbits, enabling improved class separation.

Method: Model objects via a principal fiber bundle and use a section to mod out the symmetry group. Define simple metrics on the space of objects to quantify dissimilarities between orbits under the symmetry group. Optimize the chosen section to maximize class separation. Demonstrate on a contours dataset across translations, rotations, scalings and reparameterizations, and introduce a 2-parameter family of canonical curve parameterizations (extending constant-speed) to facilitate the geometric representation.

Result: The paper presents a workable geometric framework to compare symmetry-related objects and to optimize the section for better class separation. It demonstrates the approach on contour data under multiple symmetry groups and provides a 2-parameter canonical parameterization of curves. Code and a notebook are made publicly available for replication and application.

Conclusion: A geometry-based alternative to data augmentation for incorporating symmetries in classification tasks. The method has broad applicability and can be tailored via the section choice to improve separation of classes; the work includes practical implementations with open-source code and tutorials.

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

*Seamie Hayes,Ganesh Sistu,Ciarán Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D pseudo-ground-truth from foundation models and temporal densification boosts self-supervised semantic occupancy; enables simple, strong models (EasyOcc) and improved OccNeRF, achieving competitive/SOTA results with reduced heavy rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce training cost and memory burden of self-supervised semantic occupancy learning, address semantic/depth ambiguity, and enable transferability across architectures by leveraging foundation models and temporal context.

Method: Generate 3D pseudo-labels using Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, densify labels with temporal information, and integrate into OccNeRF. Propose EasyOcc that learns solely from these labels without complex rendering.

Result: Applying pseudo-labels to OccNeRF raises mIoU from 9.73 to 14.09 (about +45%). EasyOcc attains 13.86 mIoU. On full scenes without camera mask, EasyOcc reaches 7.71 mIoU, surpassing the previous best by 31%.

Conclusion: Foundation models, temporal information, and the choice of loss computation space are pivotal for effective self-supervised semantic occupancy. Label-based approaches can generalize across architectures and reduce expensive rendering, enabling strong performance in comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

### [84] [Predicting Penalty Kick Direction Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning with Pose-Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26088)
*Pasindu Ranasinghe,Pamudu Ranasinghe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time, multi-modal deep learning system predicts penalty kick direction (left/middle/right) before ball contact using RGB frames and pose keypoints, achieving 89% test accuracy with 22 ms inference, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penalty kicks hinge on rapid interpretation of subtle kinematic cues; existing methods struggle to operate in real-time and leverage multi-modal data.

Method: Dual-branch architecture: MobileNetV2 CNN for spatial features from RGB frames; LSTM with attention for 2D pose keypoints; pose-guided attention to relevant regions; distance-based sequence segmentation before contact; custom dataset of 755 kicks with frame-level annotations; evaluation on held-out test set.

Result: 89% accuracy on held-out test; outperforms visual-only and pose-only baselines by 14–22%; inference time ~22 ms; suitable for training, analysis, and real-time analytics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a lightweight, interpretable multi-modal framework for early prediction of kick direction, with potential applicability to goalkeeper training and real-time strategy.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

*Frédéric Berdoz,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Nick Tuninga,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reason-3D uses LRMs for object retrieval and spatial reasoning to synthesize 3D scenes from text, outperforming prior methods in fidelity and constraint adherence; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-scene methods struggle with complex geometries, object transformations, and following intricate instructions; there is a need for improved object retrieval, layout, and collision-aware refinement enabled by LRMs.

Method: Leverages LRMs to retrieve objects via multi-faceted captions (physical, functional, contextual), places them using implicit/explicit layout constraints, and refines with collision-aware spatial reasoning.

Result: Significant improvements over prior methods in human-rated visual fidelity, constraint adherence, and asset retrieval quality across simple to complex indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates strong spatial reasoning capabilities of modern LRMs in 3D scene synthesis and provides a public codebase to advance object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

### [86] [EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096)
*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Entropy-aware optimization for diffusion models (EVODiff) that reduces conditional entropy during denoising to improve efficiency and quality, preferring data prediction over noise and optimizing conditional variance; achieves faster, higher-quality generation than SOTA solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are strong but suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies. Gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver lack solid information-theoretic foundations for transmission efficiency, motivating a principled approach to denoising that minimizes uncertainty.

Method: Adopt an information-theoretic view: denoising success reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. Propose EVODiff, which minimizes conditional entropy by optimizing conditional variance and uses data-prediction parameterization over noise. The method provides an entropy-aware variational objective to guide denoising steps, systematically reducing uncertainty.

Result: EVODiff outperforms state-of-the-art gradient-based solvers. On CIFAR-10, reconstruction error is reduced by up to 45.5%, and FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78 at 10 function evaluations. On ImageNet-256, NFE cost is reduced by 25% (from 20 to 15) for high-quality samples. Also improves text-to-image generation with fewer artifacts. Code available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: An information-theoretic, entropy-aware approach to diffusion-model inference yields consistent performance gains and efficiency improvements, validating the use of conditional-entropy minimization and data-prediction parameterization in denoising.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

### [87] [EchoGen: Generating Visual Echoes in Any Scene via Feed-Forward Subject-Driven Auto-Regressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26127)
*Ruixiao Dong,Zhendong Wang,Keli Liu,Li Li,Ying Chen,Kai Li,Daowen Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen enables fast, subject-driven generation by injecting subject identity into Visual Auto-Regressive models via a dual-path architecture, achieving diffusion-comparable quality with lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the efficiency-quality trade-off in subject-driven generation, combining rapid sampling of VAR models with strong fidelity.

Method: A dual-path injection: a semantic encoder provides abstract subject identity injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide composition; a content encoder captures fine details integrated via multi-modal attention to preserve texture and structure; applied within a feed-forward VAR framework.

Result: Empirical results show subject fidelity and image quality on par with diffusion-based methods while significantly reducing sampling latency.

Conclusion: EchoGen is the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built on VAR models, offering efficient, high-fidelity generation with potential for broader deployment; code/models to be released.

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

### [88] [EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157)
*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Entropy-guided dynamic patching (EntroPE) preserves temporal coherence in patch-based time-series transformers, boosting long-horizon forecasting efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally-agnostic patching disrupts short-term dependencies and natural transitions, weakening representation learning and forecasting performance.

Method: Two components: Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) uses conditional entropy to locate natural temporal shifts and place patch boundaries; Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) pools and applies cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies, producing fixed-size embeddings which are processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics.

Result: On long-term forecasting benchmarks, EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency compared with baselines, demonstrating the benefits of entropy-guided dynamic patching.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided dynamic patching is a promising paradigm for time-series modeling, balancing temporal structure preservation with computational efficiency; code is available at the referenced repository.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is a major issue; manually curating edge cases is a bottleneck; need scalable automated methods to generate challenging scenarios for training.

Method: Fine-tune a large language model via preference learning to rephrase image captions into diverse prompts. These prompts steer a text-to-image model to generate difficult visual scenarios, forming an automated edge-case synthesis pipeline.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

*Yuansen Liu,Haiming Tang,Jinlong Peng,Jiangning Zhang,Xiaozhong Ji,Qingdong He,Donghao Luo,Zhenye Gan,Junwei Zhu,Yunhang Shen,Chaoyou Fu,Chengjie Wang,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-MME provides a structured, diverse, multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on human-centric scenes, addressing granular perception and higher-level reasoning with 19,945 questions across multi-domain visuals, and demonstrates gaps in 17 SOTA MLLMs; releases data and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for human-centric scenes in MLLMs due to the complexity of the human body and annotation challenges. The work aims to enable holistic assessment across granular perception to high-level reasoning and to support multi-person/multi-image mutual understanding.

Method: Proposes Human-MME with three key features: (1) broad visual diversity (4 primary domains, 15 secondary, 43 sub-fields); (2) eight evaluation dimensions spanning from granular perception to higher-dimensional reasoning, with 19,945 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite; (3) high-quality annotations via automated pipelines and a human-annotation platform, supporting multiple question types (choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking, judgment) and complex combinations; enables single-target to multi-person/multi-image mutual understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal limitations and guide future research in human-centric image understanding; dataset and code are publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables holistic evaluation of human-centric scene understanding, pushing MLLMs toward better handling of multi-person scenes, granular perception, and higher-order reasoning, and facilitates rigorous assessment and continued progress in this area.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

### [91] [Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166)
*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies pose- and occlusion-aware fairness in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving by evaluating several detectors on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset, using Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) across confidence thresholds and Z-tests for significance. It finds biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views; occlusion of lower body joints hurts more; Cascade R-CNN shows the lowest miss-rate with the smallest attribute bias, representing a first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in autonomous driving pedestrian detection is underexplored. Pose variations and partial occlusions can unevenly affect detector performance. Quantifying these biases is essential to build robust, trustworthy AD systems.

Method: Evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, Cascade R-CNN) and three YOLOv12 variants on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Analyze pose attributes (leg status, elbow status, body orientation) and joint occlusions. Use Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) across confidence thresholds and apply Z-tests for statistical significance to assess fairness and robustness.

Result: Cascade R-CNN achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all pose/occlusion attributes. Pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, or lateral body views are perceived less fairly. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more detrimental effect on detection than upper body or head occlusions.

Conclusion: This work is the first comprehensive, pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, highlighting Cascade R-CNN as a robust baseline and underscoring the need to consider pose/occlusion fairness in detector evaluation and development.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

TL;DR: AttriGen introduces a dual-model framework for automated, fine-grained multi-attribute annotation in cell microscopy, combining a CNN for cell-type classification with a Vision Transformer for multi-attribute classification. Using PBC and WBCAtt datasets, it achieves 94.62% accuracy and improves interpretability and labeling efficiency, proposing a scalable paradigm extendable to other CV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-attribute annotation in cell microscopy is underrepresented and time-consuming; automating fine-grained labels can improve interpretability and reduce annotation costs, enabling scalable expansion of attribute annotations beyond traditional cell-type categorization.

Method: A dual-model architecture: a CNN handles cell-type classification on PBC, while a Vision Transformer handles multi-attribute classification on WBCAtt. The framework, AttriGen, leverages two complementary datasets to jointly learn and produce accurate, interpretable attribute labels.

Result: Achieves a new benchmark of 94.62% accuracy on the multi-attribute task. Demonstrates improved interpretability and substantial time/cost efficiency compared with full-scale human annotation.

Conclusion: AttriGen establishes a new paradigm for automating and expanding multi-attribute labels in computer vision, with potential extension to other tasks and datasets beyond cell microscopy.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Motivation: Enable user-specified textual descriptions to guide saliency in 360° content; fill gap for datasets and methods combining vision-language reasoning with immersive video saliency.

Method: Create TSV360 dataset with 16,000 ERP frames triplets, text descriptions, ground-truth saliency maps; adapt SOTA 360° video saliency method; propose TSalV360 that uses a vision-language model for representations, plus a similarity module and viewport spatio-temporal cross-attention to connect modalities.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate competitiveness against a SOTA visual-based approach and show ability to perform customized text-driven saliency detection in 360° videos.

Conclusion: Text-driven saliency detection in 360° videos is feasible and effective using TSV360 and TSalV360, leveraging vision-language representations and cross-modal attention to customize saliency via text.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

*Chenyang Jiang,Zhengcen Li,Hang Zhao,Qiben Shan,Shaocong Wu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDD introduces a sparse 2D Gaussian representation for dataset distillation, encoding critical information with a few primitives and CUDA-based splatting, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense pixel-level dataset distillation is inefficient and redundant, leading to scalability issues. There is a need for compact, diverse, and informative distilled data that preserves knowledge under fixed storage and computation budgets, particularly to improve hard-sample coverage.

Method: Represent distilled images as a small number of 2D Gaussian primitives (splatting) to encode discriminative information. Use CUDA-based splatting operators for fast parallel inference/training, enabling high-quality rendering with low overhead. The approach is designed to be simple, scalable, and compatible with existing distillation pipelines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets while maintaining efficient encoding/decoding costs. The method is reported to be broadly applicable and scalable, with code released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: A simple yet effective sparse representation for dataset distillation that improves data diversity and distillation performance under fixed budgets, and can be integrated into various distillation workflows with high efficiency.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

*Thomas Eleftheriadis,Evlampios Apostolidis,Vasileios Mezaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends a multigranular video-summarization explanation framework with a state-of-the-art multimodal model to generate plausible textual explanations and evaluates plausibility by semantic overlap between explanations and summaries using SBERT and SimCSE on SumMe/TVSum with CA-SUM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainable AI in video summarization by ensuring that textual explanations of visual results are plausible and align with human reasoning, and to quantify plausibility through semantic overlap with summary descriptions.

Method: Integrate LLaVA-OneVision into the existing multigranular explanation framework; prompt it to generate natural-language descriptions of visual explanations; propose a plausibility evaluation by measuring semantic overlap between textual explanations of explanations and textual descriptions of the summaries using SBERT and SimCSE embeddings; conduct experiments using the CA-SUM method on SumMe and TVSum datasets.

Result: The study evaluates whether more faithful explanations correspond to higher plausibility and compares SBERT vs SimCSE for the overlap-based plausibility measure, identifying which approach yields more plausible textual explanations within the extended framework.

Conclusion: The extended framework can generate plausible textual explanations for video summarization and reveals a nuanced relationship between faithfulness (faithfulness to the visual explanations) and plausibility (alignment with human reasoning), with insights on the preferred embedding-based plausibility approach and directions for future work.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study

### [96] [Generalized Fine-Grained Category Discovery with Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26227)
*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGCE tackles open-world generalized category discovery by leveraging multi-granularity conceptual experts and automatic category-number estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks, especially for novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world GCD requires exploiting multi-granularity visual concepts and handling unknown numbers of unlabeled categories, challenging current methods.

Method: Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning; Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL) introduces multiple experts at different granularities with a concept alignment matrix for cross-expert collaboration; MGCE can automatically estimate the number of unlabeled categories.

Result: State-of-the-art results on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, with particularly strong novel-class accuracy; MGCE outperforms parametric methods that assume known category counts by about 3.6% on average when category numbers are unknown.

Conclusion: MGCE effectively combines multi-granularity knowledge and adaptive category-number estimation to robustly discover categories in open-world data, with practical applicability and code availability.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

### [97] [IMG: Calibrating Diffusion Models via Implicit Multimodal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26231)
*Jiayi Guo,Chuanhao Yan,Xingqian Xu,Yulin Wang,Kai Wang,Gao Huang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A re-generation-based multimodal alignment method (IMG) that uses an implicit aligner and iterative preference objective to align diffusion-generated images with prompts, without extra data, and can plug into existing methods, outperforming baselines on SDXL variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise alignment between diffusion-generated images and their input prompts at scale, overcoming data-hungry finetuning and potential global image degradation from editing approaches.

Method: IMG uses a multimodal LLM to detect misalignments between image and prompt; an Implicit Aligner modulates diffusion conditioning features to enable re-generation; trains an Iteratively Updated Preference Objective to optimize realignment, all without extra data or editing operations and with plug-in compatibility.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing alignment methods on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX, with extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations; code will be released.

Conclusion: IMG provides an effective, flexible multimodal alignment framework that can enhance prior finetuning-based methods and serve as a plug-in adapter for diffusion models.

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

*Adnan Ben Mansour,Ayoub Karine,David Naccache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Distill Donut into a compact student via mechanistic interpretability-guided pruning (Donut-MINT), achieving faster inference and lower memory with preserved DocVQA performance; frames compression as circuit discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language models like Donut enable document-level VQA without OCR but are costly for real-time or resource-constrained settings. There is a need for efficient models, and mechanistic interpretability can guide architecture design for compression.

Method: Knowledge distillation from a large teacher to a smaller student, informed by mechanistic interpretability. By analyzing internal computations, identify essential subcomponents to retain and which to approximate, skip, or reparameterize, yielding a pruned Donut variant (Donut-MINT).

Result: Donut-MINT reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong DocVQA performance, demonstrating effective compression of a Visually-rich Document Understanding model.

Conclusion: Reframes compression as circuit discovery; links interpretability research with practical Vision-Language Model deployment, offering a principled approach to efficient DocVQA through mechanistic insights.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

*Zhejia Cai,Yandan Yang,Xinyuan Chang,Shiyi Liang,Ronghan Chen,Feng Xiong,Mu Xu,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Farsighted-LAM enhances latent action models with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, and SSM-VLA adds structured perception with visual Chain-of-Thought, achieving state-of-the-art results in Vision-Language-Action tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAMs struggle with poor spatial understanding from end-to-end encoders and fragile temporal perception when input frames are distant, hindering stable action modeling; there is a need for geometry-aware, temporally coherent and interpretable action representations.

Method: Farsighted-LAM introduces geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling to capture structural priors and dynamic motions; SSM-VLA builds an end-to-end VLA system atop Farsighted-LAM with structured perception and a visual Chain-of-Thought module for explicit reasoning about environmental dynamics.

Result: Empirical validation across multiple VLA tasks in simulation and real-world settings shows state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating improved robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Integrating geometry-aware spatial encoding, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning yields more robust, interpretable, and generalizable embodied intelligence in VLA systems.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

*Tuan Nguyen,Naseem Khan,Khang Tran,NhatHai Phan,Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reasoning-annotated dataset and PRPO RL method improve multimodal deepfake detection by grounding LLM reasoning to image content, achieving strong accuracy and high reasoning quality (4.55/5.0) and outperforming GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection is hampered by scarce high-quality datasets and misaligned or hallucinated explanations from multimodal LLMs. Grounded, interpretable reasoning is needed to improve trust and safety.

Method: Introduce a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), an RL algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level, with ablations comparing to GRPO.

Result: PRPO substantially improves detection accuracy and achieves the highest reasoning score (4.55/5.0). Ablation studies show PRPO outperforms GRPO under test-time conditions.

Conclusion: Grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence yields more reliable and interpretable deepfake detection; the dataset and PRPO approach advance the state of the art in multimodal DL detection and explanations.

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

### [101] [Cat: Post-training quantization error reduction via cluster-based affine transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26277)
*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT) improves PTQ in low-bit regimes by using cluster-specific affine parameters to align quantized outputs with full-precision, enabling better accuracy without fine-tuning; integrated PTQ framework shows strong gains on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ is cheaper but fragile under low-bit; plain affine transformation degrades accuracy; need a lightweight, data-efficient way to reduce quantization error.

Method: Introduce CAT with cluster-specific affine parameters; apply to LQ PTQ outputs; integrate into a PTQ framework; requires only a small number of additional parameters; no model or quantization parameter fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms prior PTQ methods across architectures and low-bit settings on ImageNet-1K; up to 53.18% Top-1 on W2A2 ResNet-18; CAT as a plug-in adds >3% improvement to baselines.

Conclusion: CAT provides effective error reduction for low-bit PTQ with minimal overhead and is easily integrable with existing PTQ frameworks; implementation will be released with the paper.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Jacopo Staiano,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProfVLM reframes skill proficiency estimation as a generative vision-language task, achieving high accuracy with far fewer parameters and producing expert-like feedback from multi-view egocentric/exocentric videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skill assessment methods rely on opaque black-box video classifiers that ignore multi-view context and lack explainability. There is a need for transparent, data-efficient models that can both assess skill and provide actionable feedback.

Method: Introduce AttentiveGatedProjector to fuse multi-view features from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model, trained to generate skill ratings plus expert-like feedback. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries; prioritizes compactness and fast training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing training time by up to 60%. Delivers superior accuracy across diverse activities and outputs natural language critiques aligned with performance, enabling transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: Generative vision-language modeling is a promising direction for skill assessment, offering accurate, explainable feedback and efficient learning across multi-view video data.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

*Teng Zhang,Ziqian Fan,Mingxin Liu,Xin Zhang,Xudong Lu,Wentong Li,Yue Zhou,Yi Yu,Xiang Li,Junchi Yan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3 introduces Progressive Label Assignment and Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss for weakly-supervised oriented object detection using point annotations, achieving strong results across sparse and dense scenes by combining dynamic pseudo labels, SAM, and watershed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and low quality of pseudo labels in existing point-supervised OOD methods; reduce labeling cost while maintaining accuracy across varying object sizes and densities.

Method: PLA dynamically estimates instance sizes at different training stages to enable appropriate label assignment strategies. PGDM-Loss extends Voronoi Watershed Loss with prior guidance to tackle sparse-scene shortcomings of Watershed and dense-scene issues with SAM, resulting in a dynamic pseudo-label-based label assignment framework that pairs SAM-like segmentation with watershed-based localization.

Result: Reported metrics on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR: 66.09% / 56.86% / 41.28% / 46.40% / 19.60% / 45.96%. The approach claims competitive performance, especially with large variation in object size or sparse object occurrences.

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3 is positioned as the first model to use dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, effectively combines SAM with the watershed algorithm, and demonstrates robust performance across both sparse and dense scenes and across object size variations.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

### [104] [FLOWER: A Flow-Matching Solver for Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26287)
*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower is a flow-based solver for inverse problems that iteratively enforces data-consistency and flow-based denoising, yielding state-of-the-art reconstructions with robust hyperparameters and a Bayesian interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems require reconstructions that fit measurements; existing plug-and-play and generative solvers offer complementary strengths but lack a unified, efficient framework. A method that integrates a pre-trained flow model with an algorithmic progression to approximate Bayesian posterior sampling can achieve high-quality results across diverse problems with stable hyperparameters.

Method: Use a pre-trained flow model. Three-step iteration: (i) flow-consistent destination estimation: velocity network predicts a denoised target; (ii) refinement: project the estimate onto the feasible set defined by the forward operator; (iii) time-progression: re-project refined destination along the flow trajectory. Theoretical analysis shows Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, bridging plug-and-play and generative solvers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on inverse problems while using nearly identical hyperparameters across tasks.

Conclusion: Flower provides a unified, practically efficient framework that unifies plug-and-play and generative inverse solvers by approximating Bayesian posterior sampling, with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

### [105] [Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26325)
*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous space-time video super-resolution method using a 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF) that encodes video as a continuous spatio-temporal field, allowing sampling anywhere in space-time, capturing detail and motion, with potential aliasing-free reconstruction via a Gaussian PSF, guided by a neural encoder; claims state-of-the-art efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SR often decouples spatial and temporal components and relies on brittle motion compensation via frame warping, leading to artifacts and limited flexibility. There is a need for a coherent, continuous representation that can sample arbitrarily in space and time while preserving detail and smooth dynamics, and enabling aliasing-controlled reconstruction.

Method: Represent video as a continuous 3D Video Fourier Field with Fourier-like sinusoidal basis. Predict coefficients of this basis using a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on the low-resolution input video. Use sampling that can incorporate a Gaussian point spread function to achieve aliasing-free reconstructions at arbitrary scales. Provide joint modeling of spatial details and temporal dynamics, enabling cheap, flexible query-time sampling across space and time.

Result: Empirically, joint modeling with VFF improves both spatial and temporal super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks over a range of upscaling factors. The method yields sharper, more temporally consistent reconstructions and is reported to be more computationally efficient than baselines.

Conclusion: The continuous VFF representation, combined with a neural encoder, offers a flexible, high-quality SR framework that supports arbitrary-scale sampling, preserves details and temporal coherence, and delivers strong performance with improved efficiency; it represents a promising direction for space-time video reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE is a training-free, two-stage framework for zero-shot composed image retrieval that boosts query semantics with MLLM-generated captions and uses a single-pass joint reasoning reranker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot CIR lacks task-specific training and labeled data; capturing user intent is hard; there is a need for training-free methods that leverage multimodal reasoning.

Method: Two-stage: 1) Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF): augment VLM-derived query with captions generated by an MLLM for the target image; 2) Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR): present top candidates as an image grid to the MLLM for joint visual-semantic reasoning in one pass.

Result: SQUARE achieves strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks and remains effective with lightweight pre-trained models.

Conclusion: A simple, training-free approach that leverages Multimodal LLMs can closely match or surpass baselines in CIR by enriching queries semantically and performing efficient, holistic reranking.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

*Keming Wu,Sicong Jiang,Max Ku,Ping Nie,Minghao Liu,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale expert-annotated reward model (MNAME) aligns with human preferences for instruction-guided image editing, enabling scalable, high-quality data curation and improved open-source editing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source image-editing models lag behind closed-source models due to the lack of a reliable reward model to scale high-quality synthetic training data; there is a need for better alignment with human preferences to guide data collection and model training.

Method: Build MNAME using a large-scale dataset of expert-annotated human preference pairs (≈200K pairs); evaluate on GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and a new benchmark (BenchName); use MNAME to curate a high-quality subset from the noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset; train Step1X-Edit on the curated subset and compare to training on the full dataset.

Result: MNAME demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences and achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks; it outperforms VLM-as-judge models; using MNAME to curate data improves downstream training (e.g., Step1X-Edit) compared to training on the full noisy dataset.

Conclusion: MNAME and its accompanying dataset can empower the community to build higher-quality open-source image-editing models; it enables reward-model–based data curation, potential RL post-training, and test-time scaling for image editing systems.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Taskoriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG) and a progressive TimeScope framework with new benchmark ToTG Bench and dataset ToTG Pile; achieves state-of-the-art on ToTG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos require identifying task-relevant moments; existing temporal grounding methods lack generalizability and struggle with long videos; a progressive coarse-to-fine reasoning framework and new high-quality datasets are needed.

Method: TimeScope uses a two-stage progressive reasoning: (1) identify a coarse-grained temporal scope likely to contain key moments, (2) refine via fine-grained moment partitioning. Also introduces ToTG Bench for evaluation and ToTG Pile dataset for training.

Result: TimeScope consistently outperforms existing temporal grounding methods and popular multimodal large models (MLLMs) across various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for progressive temporal grounding in long videos.

Conclusion: The paper defines ToTG as a new challenging task and shows that a progressive grounding approach plus dedicated benchmarks/datasets advances the field, with strong empirical results and potential for broader impact on long-video understanding.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

### [109] [Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26376)
*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new test-time scaling (ScalingAR) framework for NTP-based autoregressive image generation that uses token entropy signals at profile and policy levels to terminate low-confidence trajectories and adjust conditioning, achieving better quality, token efficiency, and robustness without early decoding or external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS has improved large language models but is underexplored for NTP-based visual autoregressive generation due to reliance on partial decoding and external rewards; there is a need for a TTS method compatible with NTP-based image generation that can handle incomplete intermediate results.

Method: Introduce token entropy as a signal for visual token generation. Two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level — fuses intrinsic and conditional signals to produce a calibrated confidence state; (ii) Policy Level — uses this state to terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule conditioning strength for phase-appropriate guidance. No early decoding or external rewards required.

Result: Experiments on GenEval and TIIF-Bench show: (1) base model improvements of 12.5% and 15.2% respectively; (2) visual token consumption reduced by 62.0% while outperforming baselines; (3) robustness improved, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ScalingAR is the first TTS framework designed for NTP-based autoregressive image generation, removing the need for early decoding or external rewards, and achieving improvements in quality, efficiency, and robustness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

### [110] [PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386)
*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a generalist, training-free video anomaly detector built as an agentic AI engineer using MLLMs, combining self-adaptive planning, heuristic reasoning, tool-assisted reflection, and memory-driven improvement to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and open-set scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General VAD requires handling any scene and any anomaly types without dataset-specific training, which current methods can't generalize. A training-free, adaptive, multi-capable agent can reduce labor and improve robustness.

Method: Four capabilities: 1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning with a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG to fetch anomaly-specific knowledge; 2) latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompts for improved reasoning; 3) progressive reflection with context-aware tools to iteratively refine decisions; 4) chain-of-memory to leverage prior experiences for continual improvement. The architecture enables zero-shot anomaly detection across multi-scenario, open-set, and complex settings.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenarios without training or manual involvement; demonstrates generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: PANDA demonstrates feasibility and potential of generalist VAD via agentic AI engineer, with contributions in RAG-based planning, prompting strategies, iterative reflection, and memory-based learning; future work may extend to more domains and scalability.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

### [111] [MotionRAG: Motion Retrieval-Augmented Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26391)
*Chenhui Zhu,Yilu Wu,Shuai Wang,Gangshan Wu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG introduces a retrieval-augmented, context-aware motion adaptation framework that transfers motion priors from reference videos into diffusion-based video generation, achieving realistic motion with zero-shot domain generalization and low inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deeply realistic video motion is hard to achieve due to complex physical constraints and diverse domain dynamics; existing models struggle to generalize motion patterns across scenarios, necessitating transferable priors and efficient adaptation.

Method: (i) Retrieval-based pipeline to extract high-level motion features via video encoder and specialized resamplers; (ii) in-context learning for motion adaptation using a causal transformer; (iii) attention-based motion injection adapter that integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: Significant improvements observed across multiple domains and base models, with negligible inference overhead. The modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by updating the retrieval database without retraining any components.

Conclusion: Retrieving and transferring motion priors from reference videos enhances the realism of generated motion in diffusion-based video synthesis and enables efficient, zero-shot domain transfer without retraining.

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

### [112] [Image-Difficulty-Aware Evaluation of Super-Resolution Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26398)
*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes difficulty-aware evaluation for SISR; introduces two image-difficulty measures (high-frequency index, rotation-invariant edge index) and an evaluation method to reveal visual differences beyond average scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Average performance metrics obscure how models perform on images of varying difficulty; some images elicit artifacts from certain models, which averages miss.

Method: Define two image-difficulty measures (high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index) to predict test images where models differ visually; pair these with an evaluation framework that maps visual differences to objective metrics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and the evaluation methodology.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware evaluation provides a more nuanced assessment of SISR models, revealing differences that average scores overlook.

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

### [113] [PRISM: Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26413)
*Pengze Xue,Shanwen Wang,Fei Zhou,Yan Cui,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A progressive, three-stage rain-deraining framework (PRISM) that combines multi-scale HA-UNet-based feature extraction with frequency-domain modeling (HDMamba) and a high-resolution refinement stage to improve restoration quality and global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-scale deraining models struggle to recover fine details and maintain global context under diverse rain patterns; there is a need for multi-scale, integrated spatial-frequency modeling to enhance deraining performance.

Method: PRISM consists of three stages: CENet (coarse extraction) and SFNet (frequency fusion) using a Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature aggregation, and RNet for final high-resolution refinement. HDMamba jointly models spatial semantics and wavelet-domain characteristics in SFNet, while the RNet operates at original resolution to recover fine-grained structures.

Result: The approach yields competitive results across multiple deraining datasets, demonstrating improved image quality by preserving structural details and global context while capturing high-frequency rain characteristics.

Conclusion: Progressive integration of spatial and frequency-domain modeling with multi-scale transformers in deraining can achieve competitive performance while maintaining structural integrity and global consistency; the proposed components (HA-UNet, HDMamba, and RNet) contribute to fine-grained recovery and high-quality restoration.

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

### [114] [Post-Training Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26436)
*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4-bit PTQ for diffusion models using QuaRTZ: retain texture by combining 8-bit outlier handling with leading-zero suppression to preserve LSBs, boosting quality while maintaining efficiency; 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves strong FID (6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell) and outperforms SVDQuant (no FP16 branches required).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require high computation; 8-bit outlier-aware PTQ can match FP32 performance, but extending to 4-bit is hard due to rounding errors that erode textures. The hypothesis is that small activations are also crucial for texture fidelity, not just outliers.

Method: QuaRTZ quantization scheme: apply 8-bit min-max quantization to handle outliers, then compress to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain low-significance bits and preserve texture details, balancing outlier preservation with LSB precision.

Result: The approach reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency. Demonstrated to generalize across diverse activation distributions. 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant which requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Conclusion: QuaRTZ provides a viable 4-bit PTQ strategy for diffusion models, preserving texture details while achieving competitive quality without extra FP16 branches, indicating good generalizability across activation distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

### [115] [Multi-View Camera System for Variant-Aware Autonomous Vehicle Inspection and Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26454)
*Yash Kulkarni,Raman Jha,Renu Kachhoria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view, real-time vehicle inspection system (AVI) that fuses 11-camera detections with a VIN-conditioned rule engine to enable variant-aware quality control, achieving high verification accuracy and defect recall at ~3.3 vehicles/min.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring every vehicle leaves the production line matching the correct variant specification and being free of defects is increasingly challenging; single-view or segmentation-only approaches underperform in a full 360° perception setting.

Method: 11 synchronized cameras capture a full 360° sweep; task-specific modules route views to YOLOv8 for parts detection, EfficientNet for ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for scratch-and-dent segmentation; a view-aware fusion layer standardizes evidence; a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detections against the manifest to produce an interpretable pass/fail report with ~300 ms latency.

Result: The system achieves 93% verification accuracy, 86% defect-detection recall, and sustains 3.3 vehicles/min throughput, outperforming single-view or no-segmentation baselines; claims to be the first publicly reported system unifying multi-camera feature validation with defect detection in an industrial automotive setting.

Conclusion: AVI demonstrates a deployable, end-to-end multi-view perception pipeline that integrates AI detectors with semantic rules to enable real-time, variant-aware quality control with strong performance and potential industry impact.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

*Hanzhou Liu,Jia Huang,Mi Lu,Srikanth Saripalli,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos introduces a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for zero-shot 3D style transfer from a single image to multi-view content, using a Transformer with geometry self-attention and global cross-attention for style, plus a voxel-based 3D style loss to enforce view-consistency without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable geometry-preserving, view-consistent 3D style transfer from a single image to multi-view scenes without per-scene optimization or precomputed poses, and to generalize to unseen categories, scenes, and styles.

Method: A single-forward 3D Gaussian representation processed by a Transformer with two pathways: geometry predictions using self-attention to preserve geometry, and style injection via global cross-attention to enforce cross-view consistency. A voxel-based 3D style loss aligns aggregated scene features to style statistics, enabling view-consistent stylization across views without explicit per-scene optimization.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality zero-shot stylization across multiple datasets, with preserved geometry and view-consistency, and strong generalization to unseen categories, scenes, and styles; validates the importance of global style-content coupling and the proposed 3D style loss, and shows scalability from single-view to multi-view settings.

Conclusion: Stylos provides a scalable, geometry-aware, view-consistent 3D style transfer solution that operates from a single image to multi-view content without per-scene optimization, leveraging a 3D style loss and cross-view coupling for broad generalization.

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

*Artur Barros,Carlos Caetano,João Macedo,Jefersson A. dos Santos,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASGRA leverages Scene Graphs and Graph Attention Networks to perform indoor scene and CSAI classification, offering explainability and privacy-preserving training while achieving strong results on Places8 and real-world CSAI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scene understanding is hindered by complex object interactions and layouts; pixel-based models lack interpretability and raise privacy concerns, especially for sensitive content like CSAI. Structured representations via scene graphs can provide explainability and enable training without exposing raw images.

Method: Images are converted to Scene Graphs that encode objects and relationships, then a Graph Attention Network performs inference to model interactions among scene components for classification tasks.

Result: On Places8, ASGRA achieves 81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured scene representations with scene graphs and GATs are a robust paradigm for indoor scene and CSAI classification, offering inherent explainability and privacy advantages alongside competitive performance; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

*Sumaiya Tabassum,Md. Faysal Ahamed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CBAM-CNN for betel leaf disease classification (2.13M parameters, 8.13 MB) achieves strong 3-class performance with 95.6% accuracy and high precision/recall, aided by Grad-CAM explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Betel leaf diseases threaten crop yield and economic value; AI offers timely, scalable disease detection, but deployment benefits from lightweight models without heavy pretrained networks.

Method: Integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module into a CNN architecture to focus on salient spatial/channel features. Trains on an enriched dataset of 10,185 images across three classes (Healthy, Leaf Rot, Leaf Spot) with attention-based feature emphasis and Grad-CAM explanations for interpretability.

Result: Test accuracy 95.58%; precision 97%; recall 94%; F1 95%; model shows competitive performance versus traditional pretrained CNNs and is lightweight (2.13M parameters, 8.13 MB). Grad-CAM visualizations provide insight into decision regions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a lightweight, attention-guided CNN can achieve high accuracy in plant-disease classification with explainable outputs, potentially enabling practical deployment in the betel leaf industry.

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

*Sattwik Basu,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Jorge Vančo Sampedro,Srihari Nelakuditi,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CoGuide, a diffusion-based inverse solver for reconstructing floorplans from trajectories. It uses a contrastive-embedding to approximate the likelihood in a smoother space, guiding the denoiser toward the posterior. It outperforms differentiable-planner baselines and guided diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing a floorplan from movement trajectories is ill-posed because many layouts fit the same data. The forward path-planning operator is non-invertible and non-differentiable, causing instability for likelihood-based optimization.

Method: A diffusion-based posterior sampler where the likelihood is reformulated in a learned embedding space. The embedding is trained with a contrastive loss to bring compatible floorplans and trajectories close and push mismatches apart. A surrogate likelihood in this space guides the denoising process toward the posterior.

Result: Across extensive experiments, the model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.

Conclusion: Embedding-space surrogate likelihood enables feasible posterior inference for non-differentiable forward operators, improving consistency and robustness in floorplan reconstruction and potentially other inverse problems.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

*Miao Rang,Zhenni Bi,Hang Zhou,Hanting Chen,An Xiao,Tianyu Guo,Kai Han,Xinghao Chen,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-training pipeline combining curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning and offline on-policy knowledge distillation to boost accuracy of billion-parameter models for edge deployment, achieving state-of-the-art performance under strict hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are powerful but require substantial compute, making direct edge deployment impractical. There is a gap after pre-training where smaller models under resource limits fail to meet task demands. A systematic post-training approach is needed to bridge this gap, enabling high-performance models on constrained edge devices (e.g., Ascend).

Method: The paper proposes a post-training pipeline consisting of curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by offline on-policy knowledge distillation. The curriculum-guided SFT organizes training data/tasks by difficulty to improve learning efficiency and alignment, while offline on-policy KD transfers teacher policies to the student without online interaction, resulting in a compact model that retains or enhances task performance.

Result: The instruction-tuned small model achieves state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization under hardware constraints and competitive accuracy across a variety of tasks, suitable for Ascend edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed post-training pipeline provides a practical, efficient route to develop high-performance language models that fit edge environments, addressing the limitations of pre-training alone and enabling effective deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++ is a robust depth completion framework for noisy dToF inputs that combines synthetic-data training, a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detector to filter erroneous measurements, and an RGB-guided depth completion network that incorporates pre-trained monocular depth priors, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets and enabling low-cost sensors to rival or beat higher-end devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world lightweight dToF sensors suffer from calibration errors, anomalies, and noise, which degrade depth completion when assuming ideal inputs and perfect RGB alignment. A robust, practical solution is needed for reliable depth recovery in real-world scenarios.

Method: 1) use a synthetic-data-based simulation pipeline to generate realistic training samples for robust model training; 2) introduce a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements; 3) design a depth completion network tailored to noisy dToF inputs that fuses RGB images and pre-trained monocular depth priors; 4) train and evaluate on multiple datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization.

Result: On ZJU-L5 and real-world samples, the training strategy yields state-of-the-art depth completion performance, with RMSE reduced by 22% and Rel reduced by 11% on average. On Mirror3D-NYU, anomaly detection improves performance by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer dataset with simulated low-cost dToF data (RealSense L515), the method surpasses L515 measurements by 22% on average. Qualitative results corroborate robustness and generalization across diverse real-world data.

Conclusion: DEPTHOR++ effectively increases depth completion robustness to noisy dToF inputs, enabling low-cost sensors to achieve or surpass higher-end devices, and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and challenging regions.

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

*Agneet Chatterjee,Rahim Entezari,Maksym Zhuravinskyi,Maksim Lapin,Reshinth Adithyan,Amit Raj,Chitta Baral,Yezhou Yang,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Cinemetrics (SCINE) introduces four hierarchical taxonomies—Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera—comprising 76 control nodes to evaluate professional-level video generation. It builds a benchmark of industry-aligned prompts, an automated prompt-categorization pipeline, and a vision-language evaluator trained on expert annotations. A large-scale human study (10+ models, 20K videos, 80+ professionals) reveals gaps especially in Event and Camera controls, and the authors claim SCINE enables scalable, structured, film-practice–driven evaluation in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-generation benchmarks inadequately capture professional filmmaking requirements. There is a need for structured, controllable evaluation grounded in industry practices to assess and improve models for professional use.

Method: Define four disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) with 76 control nodes grounded in industry practice; construct a benchmark of prompts aligned with professional use cases; develop an automated pipeline for prompt categorization and question generation; conduct a large-scale human study with 10+ models and 20k videos annotated by 80+ film professionals; train an automatic evaluator (vision-language model) aligned with expert annotations to outperform zero-shot baselines.

Result: Humans evaluated over 20k videos across 10+ models; identified significant gaps in Events and Camera controls; an automatic evaluator aligned with experts outperforms existing zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: SCINE provides a scalable, structured framework to evaluate professional video generation, with taxonomy-centered controls and pipelines, enabling targeted analysis to guide future research and development in cinematic-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

### [124] [Autoproof: Automated Segmentation Proofreading for Connectomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26585)
*Gary B Huang,William M Katz,Stuart Berg,Louis Scheffer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Leverages ground-truth manual annotations to train ML that automates/proofs proofreading in EM connectomics; achieves near-guided proofreading value with substantial cost savings; can automatically merge segmentation fragments, dramatically accelerating reconstruction (200k fragments attached) and modestly improving connectivity completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual proofreading of EM connectomes is the main bottleneck for scaling and comparative studies; reducing cost and effort is crucial to enable larger reconstructions and reproducibility.

Method: Train machine learning models using available ground-truth proofreading data to automate or optimize proofreading steps; validate on the Drosophila male CNS reconstruction; first demonstrate near-value-for-cost of guided proofreading (90% value, 80% cost reduction); second apply automatic merging of segmentation fragments to aid proofreading (attach ~200k fragments, equating to four proofreader-years).

Result: Obtained 90% of the value of guided proofreading while cutting costs by 80%; automatically attached 200k fragments (≈ four proofreader-years of work); increased connectivity completion rate by 1.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for substantially reducing manual labor in EM connectomics, enabling larger and more comparative reconstructions; effectiveness depends on availability and quality of ground-truth data and may face generalization limits across datasets.

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

### [125] [DiffCamera: Arbitrary Refocusing on Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26599)
*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera enables flexible refocusing of created images by conditioning on a new focus point and blur level using a diffusion transformer; trained on simulated data with a stacking constraint to ensure correct DoF behavior, and validated via a benchmark showing robust DoF control across scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field blur is fixed after image creation and unintended blur is hard to fix; a method is needed to refocus images post-cynthesis with controllable DoF.

Method: A diffusion transformer framework for refocusing; uses a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale pairs with varying focus planes and bokeh levels; introduces a stacking constraint during training inspired by the photographic principle that images of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image; constructs a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Training with a vanilla diffusion objective alone yields incorrect DoF behavior due to task complexity; the stacking constraint strengthens training and enables precise DoF manipulation; extensive experiments show DiffCamera achieves stable refocusing across diverse scenes and offers unprecedented DoF control for photography and generative AI applications.

Conclusion: DiffCamera provides robust, physically grounded DoF manipulation after image creation and introduces a benchmark, enabling practical refocusing in photography and AI workflows.

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

*Ilpo Viertola,Vladimir Iashin,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SAGANet for segmentation-aware audio generation conditioned on object-level segmentation maps, plus a Segmented Music Solos dataset; enables controllable, localized Foley synthesis with improved results over state of the art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal audio generation models lack fine-grained, object-level control, leading to unwanted background sounds and misprioritized objects in professional Foley workflows.

Method: Introduce SAGANet, a multimodal generative model that conditions sound synthesis on visual segmentation masks along with video and textual cues for precise, object-localized audio generation; also introduce Segmented Music Solos as a benchmark dataset with segmentation data.

Result: Demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and establishes a new standard for controllable, high-fidelity Foley synthesis; provides code, samples, and the Segmented Music Solos dataset.

Conclusion: Segmentation-aware conditioning is effective for controllable Foley-like audio generation and opens avenues for research and practical workflows, enabling fine-grained control by targeting specific objects in a scene.

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are
available at https://saganet.notion.site

*Xinjin Li,Yu Ma,Kaisen Ye,Jinghan Cao,Minghao Zhou,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid feature fusion (VGG19 + SIFT + ORB) with UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering achieves 83.3% accuracy on a FER dataset; emphasizes dimensionality reduction as key to performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression recognition is high-dimensional and complex; combining deep and handcrafted features with effective reduction strategies can improve accuracy.

Method: Extract features from VGG19 and from SIFT/ORB, fuse the features; evaluate various dimensionality reduction techniques and determine UMAP as most effective; the Hy-Facial pipeline uses VGG19+SIFT+ORB features, followed by K-means clustering and UMAP-based reduction.

Result: Classification accuracy of 83.3% on the FER dataset; UMAP preserves local and global structure and helps reduce redundancy.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction is not just preprocessing but a crucial component for improving feature quality and overall FER performance.

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

### [128] [DA$^2$: Depth Anything in Any Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26618)
*Haodong Li,Wangguangdong Zheng,Jing He,Yuhao Liu,Xin Lin,Xin Yang,Ying-Cong Chen,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA^2 is an end-to-end panoramic depth estimator that achieves strong zero-shot generalization and efficiency by combining a data-curation pipeline to convert perspective data into panoramic RGB-Depth pairs and a SphereViT that enforces spherical geometry in panoramic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation suffers from scarce panoramic data and poor zero-shot generalization; spherical distortions in panoramas make traditional CNNs less effective, and cubemap-based approaches can be inefficient.

Method: 1) Data curation engine to synthesize ~543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs from perspective data (total ~607K). 2) SphereViT: a Vision Transformer that operates in spherical coordinates to enforce spherical geometric consistency in features. 3) End-to-end depth estimator DA^2 (Depth Anything in Any Direction).

Result: DA^2 achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple datasets, with ~38% average improvement in AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline; it also outperforms some prior in-domain methods in zero-shot; and offers higher efficiency than fusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: DA^2 provides a scalable, zero-shot-generalizable panoramic depth estimation solution; code and the curated data will be released; project page contains more details.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

*Xiyi Chen,Shaofei Wang,Marko Mihajlovic,Taewon Kang,Sergey Prokudin,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART is a transformer-based framework that reconstructs a watertight clothed human mesh from few uncalibrated RGB views, aligning to SMPL-X and initializing Gaussian splats for photorealistic novel-view rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior clothed-human reconstruction methods that either rely on parametric templates (missing loose garments and interactions) or rely on simplified camera assumptions in implicit models.

Method: HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences from sparse RGB inputs, uses an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry, enforces alignment with the SMPL-X body model, and initializes Gaussian splats for sparse-view rendering; trained on 2.3k synthetic scans.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: Chamfer Distance improved by 18-23% for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V reduced by 6-27% for SMPL-X estimation, and LPIPS improved by 15-27% for novel-view synthesis across datasets.

Conclusion: Feed-forward transformers can serve as scalable models for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings; code and models will be released.

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [130] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A SIM(3)-equivariant 3D shape completion network that canonicalizes features, reasons in similarity-invariant geometry, and then restores the original frame, achieving state-of-the-art generalization without pre-alignment cues across PCN and cross-domain datasets under debiased evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-alignment of scans leaks pose and scale cues that enable memorization rather than learning intrinsic geometry; real data often lacks alignment, causing performance collapse. An architectural approach that is equivariant to the similarity group (SIM(3)) could maintain pose/scale agnosticism and promote genuine geometric understanding.

Method: Propose the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network with modular layers that canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and then restore the original frame. Evaluation uses a de-biased protocol that removes hidden cues to test true generalization.

Result: The model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark and achieves new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, e.g., KITTI minimal matching distance improves by 17% and OmniObject3D Chamfer L1 improves by 14%. Even under a stricter protocol, it surpasses competitors under biased settings.

Conclusion: Full SIM(3) equivariance is an effective strategy for truly generalizable shape completion; canonicalization and similarity-invariant reasoning enable pose/scale-agnostic processing with robust cross-domain performance.

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

### [131] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Query-Kontext to decouple multimodal reasoning from high-fidelity synthesis in Unified Multimodal Models by bridging VLMs and diffusion models via multimodal kontext tokens; uses three-stage training and diverse data; achieves competitive or superior results on unified baselines and some task-specific SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified frameworks conflate multimodal generative reasoning (instruction understanding, grounding, identity preservation, faithful reconstruction) with high-fidelity image synthesis, limiting performance and controllability of multimodal generation.

Method: Propose Query-Kontext: a multimodal kontext composed of semantic cues and coarse image conditions that bridges a visual-language model (VLM) to a diffusion-based generator. Employ a three-stage progressive training: (1) connect VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens; (2) scale to a large pre-trained diffusion model for richer details; (3) introduce a low-level image encoder and perform instruction tuning for downstream tasks. Build a data pipeline over real, synthetic, and open-source datasets covering generation, editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition.

Result: Empirical results show the approach matches strong unified baselines and, in several cases, surpasses task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Query-Kontext framework enables robust multimodal generative reasoning by delegating reasoning to the VLM while leveraging diffusion for high-quality synthesis, achievable through staged training and diverse data, with competitive to state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

### [132] [Stitch: Training-Free Position Control in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26644)
*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch is a training-free method to add external position control to Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers by automatically generating bounding boxes, enabling object-level generation and stitching for accurate spatial relations, with large gains on position-based T2I benchmarks across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing spatial relationships (e.g., above, left of) in text-to-image generation remains challenging. Early external-position controls worked with older models but clash with modern high-quality diffusion architectures, necessitating a training-free, model-agnostic solution.

Method: Stitch automatically generates bounding boxes and guides object generation within those regions, then stitches the objects together. It identifies targeted attention heads that can isolate and cut out objects mid-generation without requiring full image completion, and integrates external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) in a training-free manner.

Result: Stitch yields substantial improvements on position-based generation benchmarks: up to 218% improvement on GenEval's Position task and 206% on PosEval for FLUX, and state-of-the-art results on Qwen-Image for PosEval (≈54% better than prior models). Improvements are observed consistently across Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5.

Conclusion: Stitch provides a training-free path to incorporate external position control into leading diffusion models, producing spatially accurate and visually appealing images. The approach leverages object-level generation within bounding boxes and mid-generation attention control, achieving strong benchmark performance and establishing a reusable technique with available code.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

### [133] [TTT3R: 3D Reconstruction as Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26645)
*Xingyu Chen,Yue Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Andreas Geiger,Anpei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free test-time learning method (TTT3R) for 3D reconstruction that updates memory online with a closed-form learning rate, improving length generalization and pose accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern RNN-based 3D reconstruction struggles to generalize to longer sequences beyond training; reframing as online learning allows memory to adapt to new observations without retraining.

Method: Derives a closed-form learning rate for memory updates from alignment confidence between memory state and incoming observations; applies a training-free memory update rule at test time to balance history and adaptation.

Result: 2× improvement in global pose estimation over baselines; runs at 20 FPS on a 6 GB GPU, processing thousands of images; code available.

Conclusion: TTT3R demonstrates that scaling 3D reconstruction foundation models with test-time online memory updates can markedly improve length generalization without additional training, offering real-time performance.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

TL;DR: BEV-VLM enables Vision-Language Models to plan trajectories using fused BEV features aligned with HD maps, showing strong gains on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend VLMs beyond raw images by leveraging compressed, geometrically consistent BEV representations that fuse camera/LiDAR data and HD maps for reliable trajectory planning.

Method: Generate BEV features from multi-modal data, align with HD maps to create a unified BEV-HD Map representation, then use VLMs for trajectory planning; evaluate on nuScenes.

Result: 44.8% improvement in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance demonstrated on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that VLMs can effectively interpret processed BEV representations, broadening the applicability of VLMs to trajectory planning beyond raw images.

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SRMP is a new search-based software framework for robotic manipulation that emphasizes consistent, repeatable trajectory generation, supports multi-robot tasks, and integrates with major simulators and MoveIt! for hardware deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes robotics require predictability and repeatability in motion planning. Existing tools like OMPL may not guarantee consistency across diverse systems or multi-robot scenarios, hindering industrial safety and dataset quality for learning.

Method: Introduce SRMP (Search-based Robot Motion Planning) as a dedicated framework for robotic manipulation. Provides a Python/C++ API, supports integration with MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, PyBullet, and includes a MoveIt! plugin for rapid hardware deployment. Focuses on consistent, reliable trajectories and enables multi-robot planning.

Conclusion: SRMP delivers reliable, consistent motion planning for multi-robot manipulation, with broad simulator and hardware integration, enhancing safety and repeatability in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

### [137] [SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25358)
*Qianzhong Chen,Justin Yu,Mac Schwager,Pieter Abbeel,Fred Shentu,Philipp Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Stage-aware video reward model with natural-language subtask rewards; paired with Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), it enables robust, annotation-efficient imitation for long-horizon deformable-object tasks (e.g., T-shirt folding), outperforming vanilla BC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation (like deformable objects) suffers from inconsistent demonstrations. Grounded reward modeling offers stable, generalizable supervision to guide learning without frame-labeling, addressing variability in demonstration quality.

Method: Develop a stage-aware video reward model that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Automatically derive reward labels from natural-language subtasks to ensure consistent progress across variable-length demonstrations; avoid frame-index labeling. Evaluate robustness and generalization; integrate into Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC) to filter high-quality data and reweight samples by reward.

Result: The reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. When integrated into RA-BC, folding the T-shirt achieves 83% success from the flattened state and 67% from the crumpled state, vs 8% and 0% for vanilla BC.

Conclusion: Reward modeling is a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

### [138] [Analytic Conditions for Differentiable Collision Detection in Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26459)
*Akshay Jaitly,Devesh K. Jha,Kei Ota,Yuki Shirai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Differentiable non-penetration constraints for optimization via analytic conditions and smooth semi-algebraic polytope approximations; demonstrated in collision-aware trajectory optimization with favorable performance against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collision avoidance and non-penetration are computational bottlenecks in optimization-based planning and control; efficient and differentiable formulations are needed to enable fast, robust planning.

Method: Develop differentiable non-penetration conditions with analytic expressions; approximate non-smooth polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets; apply within optimization for collision-aware trajectory optimization; compare with recent baseline methods through numerical experiments.

Result: Numerical experiments illustrate improved performance and competitiveness relative to recent baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables faster, differentiable optimization in the presence of collision constraints by combining analytic non-penetration conditions with smooth polytope approximations, broadening applicability to planning and control tasks with contacts.

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

### [139] [Parallel Heuristic Search as Inference for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25402)
*Hanlan Yang,Itamar Mishani,Luca Pivetti,Zachary Kingston,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Parallel Actor-Critic Heuristic Search (PACHS) introduces a parallel best-first search for actor-critic RL inference, batching actions and cost-to-go estimates, and distributing graph expansion across threads to enable efficient planning in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inference-time efficiency and strong planning quality in actor-critic RL for robotics, moving beyond simple policy rollouts by exploiting the critic's cost-to-go to guide search.

Method: Two-level parallel search: (1) batch action generation by the actor network, (2) batch cost-to-go estimation by the critic network, while graph expansion is multi-threaded; uses best-first search guided by critic costs.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on robotic manipulation tasks, including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as non-prehensile pushing.

Conclusion: PACHS offers an efficient, scalable inference-based planning framework that leverages actor-critic components for improved planning in robotics.

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

### [140] [CoTaP: Compliant Task Pipeline and Reinforcement Learning of Its Controller with Compliance Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25443)
*Zewen He,Chenyuan Chen,Dilshod Azizov,Yoshihiko Nakamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage dual-agent RL pipeline, combined with model-based compliance control, enables compliant, stable upper-body interaction in humanoids by integrating SPD-manifold task-space compliance into learning; validated in simulation under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the data gap for interaction forces in human-motion datasets and the resulting difficulty of achieving compliance in learning-based humanoid control.

Method: Train a base position-based policy; distil into an upper-body policy with model-based compliance control; guide the lower-body agent with the base policy. Upper-body is endowed with adjustable task-space compliance and integrated with other controllers via SPD-manifold compliance modulation to ensure stability.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated in simulation, with analyses comparing external disturbance responses under different compliance settings.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for integrating compliant control into learning-based humanoid control via SPD-manifold modulation, but requires further validation on physical hardware and broader disturbance scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

*Zihan Zhang,Abhijit Ravichandran,Pragnya Korti,Luobin Wang,Henrik I. Christensen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-world deployment of an online HD map system onboard a campus vehicle using cameras and LiDAR, addressing campus-specific labeling, onboard SemVecMap integration, and incremental map updating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD maps are critical but expensive to produce and maintain, especially in dynamic campus environments; need an online, deployable solution to generate and update 3D HD maps in real time.

Method: Deploy system on a campus golf-cart with dual front cameras and LiDAR; label 3D HD campus map; integrate and generalize SemVecMap onboard; incrementally generate/update HD map; fine-tune with campus-specific data.

Result: Accurate map predictions; supports continual updates; demonstrates practicality in real-world autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of real-time, onboard HD map generation and incremental update in a real-world deployment, with potential for scalable, campus-wide or broader applications.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

*Mohammad Merati,David Castañón*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ESL (Exhaustive-Serve-Longest) is an optimal, simple real-time policy for online task allocation in multi-robot, multi-queue systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays, outperforming baselines in holding costs and queue lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-time scheduling for multi-robot systems with multiple queues, stochastic Bernoulli arrivals, and switching delays; minimize discounted holding costs and queue lengths.

Method: Model the problem as a discounted-cost Markov decision process; propose ESL: exhaustively serve when at a nonempty location, switch to the longest unoccupied nonempty location when idle; prove optimality; compare against tuned fixed-dwell cyclic policy and FCFS baselines.

Result: ESL achieves lower discounted holding costs and smaller mean queue lengths across varying server-to-location ratios and loads; shows higher serving share and restrained switching in action times; robust and simple.

Conclusion: ESL is a practical, robust default for real-time multi-robot scheduling in stochastic, delayed settings.

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

*Nathaniel Hanson,Benjamin Pyatski,Samuel Hibbard,Gary Lvov,Oscar De La Garza,Charles DiMarzio,Kristen L. Dorsey,Taşkın Padır*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A mobile-robot hyperspectral imaging system (HYPER DRIVE) collects and registers multi-wavelength data, calibrates reflectance under varying illumination, and demonstrates applications like vegetation health indices and soil moisture estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class terrain differences (e.g., water content) affect a vehicle's traversability, and RGB cannot reliably distinguish these properties. Spectral data beyond RGB, especially in near-infrared, provides richer information for terrain characterization. However, spectral analysis requires illumination-invariant reflectance calibration to be reliable in real-world conditions.

Method: Design and implement a system architecture to collect and register hyperspectral images on a mobile robot. Develop a reflectance calibration approach to account for changing illumination, and validate the system by computing vegetative health indices and soil moisture content from the collected spectra.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content from a mobile robot platform, indicating successful hyperspectral sensing, registration, and illumination compensation in a mobile setting.

Conclusion: A mobile-robot hyperspectral sensing platform with reflectance calibration under variable illumination is feasible and effective for terrain analysis tasks, enabling intra-class differentiation (e.g., health of vegetation, soil moisture) crucial for navigation and decision-making.

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: We propose dVLA, a diffusion-based Vision-Language-Action model that unifies perception, language reasoning, and robotic control under a single diffusion objective with multimodal chain-of-thought; it attains state-of-the-art LIBERO performance (96.4% avg success) and robust real-world results on a Franka robot, aided by latency-reduction techniques (prefix attention mask and KV caching).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve tighter integration of sensing, reasoning, and action in robotics, enabling better cross-modal reasoning and generalization to new instructions/objects while keeping latency manageable for real-world deployment.

Method: Train a diffusion-based VLA model that jointly optimizes perception, language understanding, and action with a single diffusion objective; incorporate multimodal chain-of-thought; apply two inference acceleration strategies: prefix attention mask and KV caching.

Result: On LIBERO, achieves 96.4% average success and outperforms both discrete and continuous action policies. On a real Franka robot, succeeds across diverse tasks including a multi-step bin-picking task, demonstrating robust real-world performance.

Conclusion: Unified diffusion frameworks hold strong promise for practical, high-performance VLA robotics, enabling end-to-end perception-language-action fusion with improved generalization and deployability.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

### [145] [Hierarchical Diffusion Motion Planning with Task-Conditioned Uncertainty-Aware Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25685)
*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical diffusion planner with task-conditioned structured noise derived from GPMP improves planning performance over isotropic diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion planners use isotropic Gaussian noise that ignores task/motion structure; there is a need to bias priors toward feasible trajectories to improve success, smoothness, and task alignment while keeping tractable inference.

Method: Generalize diffusion to biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior expressions. Introduce a two-level hierarchy: upper level instantiates a task-conditioned structured Gaussian prior (mean and covariance) derived from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP) using sparse key states or timings; lower level denoises the full trajectory under that fixed prior.

Result: In Maze2D goal-reaching and KUKA block stacking, the method yields higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger task alignment than isotropic baselines. Ablation studies show benefits beyond mere conditioning of the neural network. The approach concentrates probability mass near feasible, smooth, semantically meaningful trajectories while remaining tractable.

Conclusion: Structuring the corruption in diffusion planning helps bias sampling toward feasible, task-aligned trajectories without sacrificing tractability, offering performance gains and a flexible integration of task structure into diffusion dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

### [146] [OmniNav: A Unified Framework for Prospective Exploration and Visual-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25687)
*Xinda Xue,Junjun Hu,Minghua Luo,Xie Shichao,Jintao Chen,Zixun Xie,Quan Kuichen,Guo Wei,Mu Xu,Zedong Chu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniNav is a unified, fast-slow navigation framework that learns continuous-space waypoints for instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal, and frontier-based exploration, improving generalization via multi-task pretraining and achieving state-of-the-art results plus real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no single model that generalizes across diverse embodied navigation tasks. Existing methods often specialize in single paradigms and struggle with general instruction/object understanding, leading to lower success and limited generalization. A scalable, generalizable solution is needed.

Method: A fast module predicts short-horizon, continuous-space waypoints (coordinates and orientations) from visual context and subtasks; a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon observations and candidate frontiers to select subgoals/subtasks. OmniNav is trained in a joint multi-task regime, incorporating large-scale datasets from image captioning and visual recognition to boost generalization. The architecture supports instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal, and frontier-based exploration within a single framework and operates at control frequencies up to 5 Hz.

Result: OmniNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple navigation benchmarks and is validated in real-world deployments. The fast-slow collaboration improves path efficiency and trajectory coherence, especially in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: OmniNav provides practical insights for embodied navigation and charts a scalable path toward versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence with a unified architecture spanning diverse navigation paradigms.

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

*Si-Cheng Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Ao-Qun Jin,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using action-chunked PPO with self-collected demonstrations and an online-updated BC loss improves post-training RL for vision-language-action tasks, achieving high efficacy on MetaWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards and unstable training hinder the deployment of post-training VLA models; a robust, data-efficient RL approach is needed for real-world fine-tuning and downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce action chunks to PPO to improve temporal consistency and feedback density, train with behavior cloning from self-collected demonstrations, use a dynamically updated demonstration buffer, and adapt the relative weight between PPO and BC losses online to stabilize training. Evaluate on MetaWorld and compare to supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17), outperforming supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating RL viability for VLA post-training.

Conclusion: Action-chunked PPO with self-collected demonstrations and online BC loss is a viable, data-efficient approach for post-training RL in VLA systems and lays groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

### [148] [TacRefineNet: Tactile-Only Grasp Refinement Between Arbitrary In-Hand Object Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25746)
*Shuaijun Wang,Haoran Zhou,Diyun Xiang,Yangwei You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TacRefineNet is a tactile-only framework for in-hand pose refinement of known objects, using multi-finger fingertip sensing to iteratively align the object to a target pose with millimeter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grasp execution often suffers from pose inaccuracies in long-horizon tasks, causing failure even when perception and planning are strong. A last-mile solution leveraging tactile feedback can improve reliability without relying on vision.

Method: A multi-branch policy network fuses tactile data from multiple fingers and proprioception to predict pose-update commands. The system iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose to align the object with the desired configuration. Training combines large-scale MuJoCo-based tactile simulations with real-world data (pretraining on sim, fine-tuning on real data).

Result: Pretraining on simulated tactile data followed by fine-tuning with limited real data substantially improves performance over purely simulation-based training. Real-world experiments demonstrate millimeter-level grasp accuracy using only tactile input.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first method for arbitrary in-hand pose refinement using multi-finger tactile sensing alone, establishing tactile-only refinement as a viable last-mile solution for robust grasping.

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

### [149] [Best of Sim and Real: Decoupled Visuomotor Manipulation via Learning Control in Simulation and Perception in Real](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25747)
*Jialei Huang,Zhaoheng Yin,Yingdong Hu,Shuo Wang,Xingyu Lin,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decouples control learning in simulation from perception learning at deployment to enable efficient sim-to-real transfer for tabletop manipulation; achieves strong data efficiency (10-20 real demos) and good generalization by learning universal control in simulation and alignment-based perception at deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end sim-to-real methods struggle due to entangled perception and control; need to exploit simulation to learn robust control while adapting perception to real observations.

Method: Train control policies in simulation with privileged state, use systematic randomization for robust control; deployment-time perception module maps real sensor data to the frozen policy's expected input; treat perception as a domain-specific alignment task rather than end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves strong performance with 10-20 real demonstrations; better data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines; policies generalize to object positions and scales beyond training.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception from control improves sim-to-real transfer; universal control strategies learned in simulation; perception handles domain-specific real observations; validated on tabletop manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

### [150] [SAC Flow: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Flow-Based Policies via Velocity-Reparameterized Sequential Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25756)
*Yixian Zhang,Shu'ang Yu,Tonghe Zhang,Mo Guang,Haojia Hui,Kaiwen Long,Yu Wang,Chao Yu,Wenbo Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reparameterize velocity in flow-based policies to stabilize gradient flow, via Flow-G (gated velocity) and Flow-T (decoded velocity), enabling SAC-based end-to-end training with noise-augmented rollouts and achieving SOTA on continuous control/robotics without distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy RL suffers from gradient pathologies because the flow rollout is equivalent to a residual recurrent computation, causing vanishing/exploding gradients; a stable training method is needed for end-to-end optimization in both from-scratch and offline-to-online settings.

Method: Introduce Flow-G and Flow-T by reparameterizing the velocity network: Flow-G uses a gated velocity mechanism; Flow-T uses a decoded velocity. Develop a practical SAC-based algorithm using noise-augmented rollout for stable end-to-end training. The approach supports from-scratch and offline-to-online learning and avoids policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Result: Attains state-of-the-art performance on continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, without resorting to common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: Reparameterizing the velocity network to stabilize gradient flow effectively mitigates gradient pathologies in flow-based policies, enabling robust end-to-end training and superior performance in off-policy reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

*Jing Wang,Weiting Peng,Jing Tang,Zeyu Gong,Xihua Wang,Bo Tao,Li Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DP-AG introduces a unified perception-action diffusion framework where latent representations evolve via an action-guided SDE, guided by the diffusion policy's noise via a Vector-Jacobian Product, and reinforced by a cycle-consistent contrastive loss. The approach is theoretically grounded and empirically strong on sim benchmarks and UR5 manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning methods typically decouple perception and action, ignoring the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution. This gap limits adaptive behavior. The paper motivates a bidirectional, dynamically coupled perception-action model to better capture human-like adaptability.

Method: Encode latent observations as a Gaussian posterior via variational inference. Evolve latent states using an action-guided stochastic differential equation, where the Vector-Jacobian Product of the diffusion policy's noise predictions acts as a structured stochastic force for latent updates. Introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss to align gradient flow between the perception and action pathways, enforcing coherent transitions in latent updates and action refinements. Provide a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE and show the contrastive objective improves continuity in latent and action trajectories.

Result: DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning by integrating probabilistic latent dynamics with action-guided diffusion and bidirectional learning signals.

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

*Zitong Bo,Yue Hu,Jinming Ma,Mingliang Zhou,Junhui Yin,Yachen Kang,Yuqi Liu,Tong Wu,Diyun Xiang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: REVER enables vision-language models to plan and verify long-horizon manipulation from natural language by training RoboFarseer to emit chain-of-thought, using the Universal Manipulation Interface (USI) for data, and a verifiable bipartite-overlap reward; it achieves strong real-world performance and opens-source resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two key gaps hinder real-world VLM-based planning: (i) scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data aligned with language and multi-step plans; (ii) absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning planning objectives.

Method: REVER framework trains RoboFarseer to produce chain-of-thought reasoning for temporal/spatial planning. Data is collected via Universal Manipulation Interface to capture hardware-agnostic atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts demonstrations into vision-instruction-plan triplets. A verifiable reward scores generated plans by ordered bipartite overlap with ground-truth skill sequences. At run-time, the VLM acts as both planner and monitor, verifying step-wise completion. The dataset and model will be open-sourced.

Result: RoboFarseer matches or exceeds performance of much larger proprietary models; on open-ended planning it beats the best baseline by >40%. In real-world long-horizon tasks, the complete system increases overall success by ~60% compared to a baseline with the same low-level controller but no planner.

Conclusion: The REVER framework effectively bridges data and reward gaps for VLM-based planning, enabling robust, long-horizon manipulation from natural language in real-world settings; the approach yields strong empirical gains and will be released as open data/models.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Neural-network state estimation for a morphing, compliant robot enabling joint rigid-body and shape-state estimation; achieves accurate shape (4.2% of size), velocity (6.3% linear, 2.4% angular), orientation (1.5°), and a 3x travel-range boost under motor fault on GOAT platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust state estimation for robots with active or passive compliance and morphing, where traditional rigid-body assumptions break due to changing morphology and contact with uncertain outdoor environments.

Method: A neural-network-based state estimator that uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable sensors. It is trained on motion-capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that accounts for morphing-related states and is tested on the GOAT platform.

Result: The estimator predicts shape-related measurements within 4.2% of the robot’s size, velocities within 6.3% of the top linear speed and 2.4% of the top angular speed, and orientation within 1.5 degrees. It also yielded a 300% (3×) increase in travel range during motor malfunction when used for closed-loop autonomous outdoor operation.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator enables robust, closed-loop autonomous operation of morphing, compliant robots in uncertain outdoor environments by jointly estimating rigid-body and compliance-related states and mitigating unreliable sensor information.

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

TL;DR: Capacitance-based woven tactile skin enables gesture-driven control on curved robots; a lightweight conv-transformer achieves near-100% gesture recognition, reducing task time by up to 57% vs keyboards/pads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a natural, embodied HRI interface that bridges human intent and robot action, overcoming the limitations of panel- or device-based controls and enabling seamless interaction on curved robot surfaces.

Method: Develop a woven, fabric-like tactile skin with interlaced conductive threads for dense multi-channel sensing; define a 14-gesture mapping; implement a lightweight convolution-transformer model for real-time gesture recognition; integrate the skin with curved robot surfaces and validate on robot-arm tasks.

Result: Gesture recognition accuracy approaches 100%, outperforming baselines; in robot-arm tasks (e.g., pick-and-place, pouring) the approach reduces task completion time by up to 57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants.

Conclusion: A practical, natural, and efficient embodied HRI pathway is demonstrated, showing that capacitance-based woven tactile skins can enable intuitive gesture control on curved robots with high recognition accuracy and significant task-time reductions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

*Peilong Han,Fan Jia,Min Zhang,Yutao Qiu,Hongyao Tang,Yan Zheng,Tiancai Wang,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MUVLA is a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action model for object navigation that uses semantic map abstractions and a three-stage training pipeline to unify history and present observations, learn spatial understanding, imitate mixed-quality demonstrations, and amplify rewards. It generalizes well on HM3D and Gibson, achieving effective exploration even from imperfect trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object navigation by grounding actions in a spatially structured semantic map and by leveraging diverse, potentially low-quality demonstrations through reward-guided learning, enabling robust generalization and efficient exploration.

Method: Inputs include current and history observations plus a semantic map. MUVLA encodes spatial context into a compact representation and predicts an action sequence conditioned on a goal-object description. Training is a three-stage pipeline: (1) learn map-level spatial understanding, (2) imitate behaviors from mixed-quality demonstrations, (3) reward amplification via dense short-horizon progress signals to learn action values and guide exploration.

Result: Experiments on HM3D and Gibson show strong generalization and effective exploration, even from low-quality or partially successful trajectories, indicating robust spatial understanding and action-value estimation.

Conclusion: MUVLA unifies diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and yields more rational exploration strategies, demonstrating strong generalization in object-navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

*Shengpeng Wang,Yulong Xie,Qing Liao,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: S^3E introduces a self-supervised framework that fuses millimeter-wave radar spectra with inertial data to enable robust state estimation without labeled ground truth, addressing radar sparsity, ghost points, and low angle resolution via cross-fusion of exteroceptive and proprioceptive signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar localization is appealing for affordability and reliability in harsh conditions, but current approaches depend on sparse radar point clouds and post-processed landmarks, suffering from sparsity, multipath ghosts, and limited angle resolution. A ground-truth-free learning framework that leverages multimodal signals could improve robustness and practicality.

Method: S^3E leverages richer radar signal spectra instead of sparse landmarks, and employs a cross-fusion technique to enhance spatial structure by exploiting rotational shift correlations across heterogeneous data. It fuses exteroceptive radar spectra with proprioceptive inertial data in a self-supervised manner, enabling state estimation without localization ground-truth supervision.

Result: Experimental results indicate robust and accurate state estimation without ground-truth supervision, and claim to be the first to fuse radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary self-supervised framework.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of radar spectra–inertial cross-fusion for self-supervised state estimation, addressing radar sparsity and limited angle resolution, and paves the way for ground-truth-free multimodal localization in challenging environments.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

*Elisabetta Zibetti,Sureya Waheed Palmer,Rebecca Stower,Salvatore M Anzalone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A pilot study (n=22, ages 7–11) tests how robotic expressiveness (body-only, face-only, body+face) and two emotions (happiness, sadness) in an anthropomorphic robot affect children's alignment in a cooperative turn-taking game; alignment follows the robot's inferred emotional state but higher expressiveness levels do not increase alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether robotic emotional expressiveness can shape children's empathic responses and behavior, addressing a debate on the persuasive potential of robots in children's social development.

Method: Pilot study with 22 children aged 7–11. Manipulated embodied expressiveness (body-only, face-only, body+face) and two basic emotions (happiness, sadness) displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) during a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. Measured whether children aligned their behavior with the robot's inferred emotional state.

Result: Children aligned their behavior with the robot's inferred emotional state, but higher levels of expressiveness did not increase this alignment.

Conclusion: These preliminary findings prompt reflection on how robotic expressiveness influences children as social peers; more research is needed to understand its role in shaping children's social-emotional behavior toward robots.

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

TL;DR: A unifying planar Signorini formulation links discrete Signorini contact laws with a continuum surface model, introducing an extended center of pressure and a conic complementarity framework that captures sticking, separating, and tilting regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge discrete (Signorini) and continuous (surface) contact models in robotics, enabling robust simulation and advanced control/optimization for planar contacts.

Method: Introduce planar Signorini condition as a conic complementarity formulation for general planar rigid-body contacts; prove equivalence to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across a contact surface; provide geometric interpretation of sticking, separating, and tilting regimes; define an extended center of pressure.

Result: A mathematically consistent and computationally tractable framework that unifies discrete and continuous planar contact models, yielding an extended center of pressure and a robust basis for simulation and planning.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled foundation for planar contacts in robotics, with implications for accurate contact dynamics simulation, and for designing optimization and control algorithms in locomotion and manipulation; it bridges a long-standing gap between discrete contact laws and surface-level contact reasoning.

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

### [159] [Conflict-Based Search and Prioritized Planning for Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26050)
*Shaoli Hu,Shizhe Zhao,Zhongqiang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces M-PAMO and a hybrid planning framework that blends CBS, Prioritized Planning, and PAMO* to compute collision-free paths for multiple agents among movable obstacles; provides an empirical comparison up to 20 agents and hundreds of obstacles, highlighting trade-offs and scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In logistics and warehouses, mobile robots must navigate among movable obstacles, causing exponential growth in the combined state space and strong coupling between agents. This motivates developing scalable, collision-free planning for M-PAMO.

Method: Adapt and fuse Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF with a recent single-agent PAMO planner (PAMO*) to address M-PAMO, and evaluate their performance on scenarios with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable obstacles.

Result: The paper presents a first comparative study of these approaches, outlining their strengths and weaknesses. While the hybrids show advantages in certain regimes, none is universally superior, and coordination among movable obstacles remains a key challenge.

Conclusion: This work is a first step toward tackling M-PAMO, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating CBS, PP, and PAMO* and highlighting open challenges in scalability and coupling induced by movable obstacles; provides guidance for future improvements and hybrid designs.

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

### [160] [Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-Powered Co-Design for Humanoid Chin-Up Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26082)
*Tianyi Jin,Melya Boukheddimi,Rohit Kumar,Gabriele Fadini,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EA-CoRL combines evolutionary hardware co-design with continuous RL-based policy adaptation to co-optimize actuators (gear ratios) and policy for the RH5 humanoid, achieving superior performance and broader design exploration than prior RL co-design methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential design limits exploitation of hardware capabilities; a co-design framework that evolves hardware while continuously adapting the control policy can maximize robot performance, especially for dynamic tasks.

Method: Two components: (1) Design Evolution uses an evolutionary algorithm to explore hardware configurations (e.g., gear ratios) and identify efficient options; (2) Policy Continuous Adaptation fine-tunes a task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize rewards; evaluation on RH5 humanoid for a dynamic chin-up task; comparison against state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods.

Result: EA-CoRL achieves higher fitness scores and expands the design space; continuous policy adaptation is crucial for performance gains; outperforms existing RL-based co-design baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating design evolution with continuous policy adaptation yields a powerful co-design framework, enabling better hardware-performance coupling and generalizing to other tasks and robots.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Swarm-based multi-robot inpatient care system employing wearables, RF communication, and AI-assisted decision support, validated in simulation and self-testing with strong accuracy and reliability; indicates potential for cost-effective hospital automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses need for continuous patient monitoring, timely medicine delivery, and emergency support in hospital settings, while leveraging robust, scalable swarm robotics. Ethical constraints precluded live patient trials, hence simulation and self-testing were used for validation.

Method: Leader-follower swarm architecture with a Leader robot collecting vitals (temperature, SpO2, heart rate, fall detection) and coordinating others; Assistant robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery; robotic arm administers drugs. AI-driven decision support provides early warnings. Hardware includes Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 modules, and HuskyLens. Validation conducted in a simulated hospital environment with wearable sensors.

Result: Sensor accuracy > 94%; task-level success rate 92%; communication reliability 96%. AI decision support produced early warnings of abnormal health conditions. System demonstrated robustness and potential cost-effectiveness for hospital automation and patient safety.

Conclusion: The study shows promise for swarm-based hospital automation with robust monitoring and medication-delivery capabilities. Validation is limited to simulation and self-testing; real-world trials are needed to confirm practicality, safety, and regulatory compliance, but the approach offers a scalable, potentially cost-saving solution.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall
sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96%
communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective
solution for hospital automation and patient safety.

*Julian Valdez,Ignacio Torroba,John Folkesson,Ivan Stenius*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient side scan sonar-based SLAM for kelp farms that treats ropes as landmark sequences per ping, improving autonomous AUV navigation; validated with hardware-in-the-loop experiments; dataset available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating seaweed farming requires safe, online pose estimation and mapping of farm infrastructure; current navigation/mapping bottlenecks hinder scalable deployment of autonomous AUVs in kelp farms.

Method: AUV-side scan sonar SLAM that models kelp farm structural ropes as sequences of individual landmarks detected in each SSS ping, avoiding elongated feature representations and enabling efficient back-end optimization; validated with hardware-in-the-loop experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm; dataset/framework provided at GitHub.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art SLAM solutions in hardware-in-the-loop tests in a real kelp-farm survey scenario.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable SSS-SLAM framework and accompanying dataset are released, enabling reliable navigation and mapping for autonomous kelp farming; repository available at the cited GitHub link.

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can
be found at https://github.com/julRusVal/sss_farm_slam.

### [163] [Terrain-Awared LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Legged-Wheel Robots Based on Radial Basis Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26222)
*Yizhe Liu,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Terrain-aware LiDAR-Inertial odometry using adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF) terrain modeling with soft constraints and GPU-accelerated sparse kernel computations, achieving robust 3D localization on unstructured terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LIO methods suffer from pose drift when terrain geometry is ignored, especially under abrupt elevation changes and sparse features; incorporating terrain geometry can regularize odometry and reduce z-axis drift.

Method: Approximate terrain with adaptively selected RBF centers and recursively updated weights to form a smooth terrain manifold; integrate soft constraints into the odometry optimization to regularize height estimation; ensure real-time performance by evaluating RBF terms and computing the inverse of the sparse kernel matrix on a GPU.

Result: Experiments on unstructured terrains show higher localization accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with continuous height changes or sparse features during abrupt height changes.

Conclusion: Terrain-aware LIO with adaptive RBF modeling and GPU-accelerated computations effectively mitigates height drift and improves localization under challenging terrain conditions, while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

### [164] [ISyHand: A Dexterous Multi-finger Robot Hand with an Articulated Palm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26236)
*Benjamin A. Richardson,Felix Grüninger,Lukas Mack,Joerg Stueckler,Katherine J. Kuchenbecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A low-cost, open-source robotic hand (ISyHand) with an articulated palm designed to boost dexterity; uses Dynamixel servos; ~$1,300; 4-hour assembly; trained with RL in simulation for cube reorientation; outperforms two comparable hands in early training; converges similarly after training; real-world deployment demonstrates dexterous manipulation of a cube.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of affordable, dexterous, anthropomorphic robotic hands for research and education; enable rapid prototyping and reinforcement learning experiments with hardware that is affordable and manufacturable.

Method: Hardware design: articulated palm, on-joint servos (Dynamixel), 3D-printed components; assembly in ~4 hours; total material cost ≈ $1,300. Evaluation: RL in simulation to train a cube reorientation policy; compare against two comparable hands and a fixed-palm variant; transfer trained policy to real ISyHand to perform cube manipulation.

Result: In simulation, ISyHand outperforms the two most comparable hands during early training phases and shows similar performance to others after policy convergence; the articulated palm yields a significant advantage over a fixed-palm version; a policy trained in simulation successfully transfers to the real hand to perform cube reorientation.

Conclusion: The articulated-palm design enables higher dexterity at modest anthropomorphism cost, making a low-cost, open-source dexterous hand feasible; demonstrates sim-to-real viability for dexterous manipulation and has potential to accelerate research and education in this area.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

### [165] [Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308)
*Niklas Grambow,Lisa-Marie Fenner,Felipe Kempkes,Philip Hotz,Dingyuan Wan,Jörg Krüger,Kevin Haninger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autoencoder-based anomaly detection on multimodal time-series data for industrial robot manipulation, showing cross-task and cross-control generalization with strong detection in cabling and screwing but not all subtleties in polishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution states cause unpredictable robot behavior and task failure. There is a need for transferable, data-efficient anomaly detection that works across different tasks and control strategies; time-series force/torque data captures robot-environment interactions with high temporal resolution.

Method: Study three industrial tasks (cabling, screwing, sanding) with several anomalies. Collect multimodal time-series data. Compare several autoencoder-based anomaly detection methods. Evaluate generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, impedance control). Assess data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics.

Result: AUROC > 0.93 for failures in cabling and screwing (e.g., misaligned parts, obstructed targets). In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected; more subtle failures remained undetected.

Conclusion: Anomaly detection based on autoencoders can reliably detect certain OOD events across tasks and control strategies and is data-efficient with fast detection in some tasks. Generalization across tasks/control strategies is supported, but performance gaps for subtler or more variable failures indicate room for improvement and task-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

### [166] [LLM-MCoX: Large Language Model-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26324)
*Ruiyang Wang,Haolun Tsu,David Hunt,Shaocheng Luo,Jiwoo Kim,Miroslav Pajic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces LLM-MCoX, an LLM-guided multi-robot coordination framework for unknown indoor exploration and object search that processes LiDAR data, detects frontiers and doors, and assigns coordinated waypoints using multimodal LLMs, improving exploration speed and search efficiency while enabling natural language guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional greedy frontier approaches with limited coordination underperform in large, unknown indoor environments, especially for heterogeneous robot teams. There is a need for scalable, flexible coordination that can incorporate human semantic guidance via natural language and leverage LLM reasoning on shared maps and robot states.

Method: Real-time LiDAR processing to extract frontier clusters and detect doorways; multimodal LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) reasoning over shared maps and robot states to generate coordinated waypoint assignments for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams; support for natural language guidance for object search; comparative experiments against greedy and Voronoi-based planners in large environments with 6 robots.

Result: LLM-MCoX achieves 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency versus baseline planners in large environments with 6 robots; demonstrates superior performance. Also enables natural language-based object search for human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance.

Conclusion: LLM-based coordination is a promising approach for efficient multi-robot exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments, offering performance gains and a flexible, human-interpretable interface.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

### [167] [Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339)
*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sequence of planning approaches (VEH, PEH, GEH, GEGRH) for mobile robots under evolving world models; GEGRH yields lower-cost trajectories and faster planning than VEH and SH in field tests, addressing cross-cycle divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots with limited knowledge and noisy sensing struggle to consistently classify obstacles vs free space; cost maps can flip between obstacle and free labels across planning cycles, necessitating planning that remains safe or incurs minimal rerouting.

Method: Three iterations: PEH runs a sub-search for node expansions crossing divergence points; GEH defers sub-search until an edge reaches the goal region; GEGRH revises the graph at divergent nodes per world; comparison against VEH and single-hypothesis (SH) search; field experiment on unstructured off-road terrain with a Clearpath Warthog UGV.

Result: PEH and GEH find more optimistic (lower-cost) solutions than VEH but do not meet sub-second planning; GEGRH achieves lower-cost trajectories and faster average planning times than VEH; compared to SH, GEGRH is more conservative with a modest rise in planning time.

Conclusion: GEGRH offers the best balance among the iterations, delivering improved plan quality and planning speed versus VEH and SH in field tests; the approach demonstrates robustness to history of world models, though real-time performance and generalization across scenarios warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

*Zichao Shen,Chen Gao,Jiaqi Yuan,Tianchen Zhu,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER offers adaptive, state-aware, and error-aware embodied task planning by introducing a State-Dependency Graph and a two-stage replanning mechanism, improving success rates and goal completion under errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based embodied task planners suffer from fixed planning paradigms, lack of explicit action precondition/effect modeling, and being error-agnostic, which hampers robustness in real environments.

Method: Introduce a State-Dependency Graph to model action preconditions and effects and guide dynamic plan revisions. Implement an error-adaptive replanning strategy with (1) Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and (2) Adaptive Action SubTree Generation to locally reconstruct plans based on the current environment state.

Result: Experiments show SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal completion, with larger gains under diverse error conditions.

Conclusion: Adaptive, state-aware, and error-aware planning enhances robustness and effectiveness of embodied task planning using LLMs, addressing key limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

*Mattia Piazza,Mattia Piccinini,Sebastiano Taddei,Francesco Biral,Enrico Bertolazzi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FBGA is a forward–backward algorithm for time-optimal velocity profiling along paths with generic acceleration constraints; it delivers high accuracy at very low computation cost and supports online multi-query planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-optimal velocity profiling along prescribed paths is central to robot trajectory planning and autonomous racing. Existing approaches struggle: either they handle general (non-convex) acceleration constraints at high computational cost, or they use conservative box constraints for efficiency. There is a need for a method that combines general constraint handling with fast performance suitable for online contexts.

Method: FBGA performs simultaneous forward and backward passes on short, discretized path segments to maximize the velocity profile while honoring user-defined performance limits. It accommodates generic (including non-convex) acceleration constraints via custom formulations and demonstrates strong performance across multiple tracks and vehicle classes. The implementation is open-source in C++ and designed for online multi-query use.

Result: FBGA’s maneuvers and lap times match optimal-control baselines within 0.11%–0.36% and are up to three orders of magnitude faster than baselines. It maintains high accuracy even with coarse discretization, enabling efficient online planning. Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes with complex constraints.

Conclusion: FBGA offers an accurate and computationally efficient solution for time-optimal velocity profiling under generic acceleration constraints, making it well-suited for real-time trajectory planning in racing and robotics. The open-source implementation facilitates adoption and benchmarking.

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

### [170] [Unwinding Rotations Reduces VR Sickness in Nonsimulated Immersive Telepresence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26439)
*Filip Kulisiewicz,Basak Sakcak,Evan G. Center,Juho Kalliokoski,Katherine J. Mimnaugh,Steven M. LaValle,Timo Ojala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unwinding camera rotations in immersive telepresence with a real 360° camera on a robot improves comfort and reduces VR sickness without harming task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR sickness and user discomfort are concerns in immersive telepresence when a camera moves with a robot; prior work showed benefits of unwinding rotations in virtual environments; this study tests if those benefits hold with real video streams.

Method: 36 participants performed tasks using a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm, comparing unwound (rotations decoupled from robot motion) vs coupled rotations; included 3D translation/rotation inspection tasks to assess performance.

Result: Participants preferred unwinding; reduced VR sickness and greater comfort, with no significant degradation in task performance.

Conclusion: Unwinding robot rotations in real-camera immersive telepresence improves user comfort and reduces sickness without compromising effectiveness, supporting deployment in real-world robotic telepresence systems.

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task

### [171] [Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points for Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26513)
*Saad Abdul Ghani,Kameron Lee,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework LfH-CP to generate diverse dynamic obstacle datasets by locating critical points that force optimal plans and synthesizing varied, collision-free trajectories through them, improving planner performance vs. baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic obstacle-rich motion planning requires large, diverse datasets; traditional data collection is expensive and hallucination methods can suffer from mode collapse or insufficient coverage; a scalable, self-supervised data synthesis approach is needed.

Method: Two-stage hallucination: (1) identify when and where obstacles must appear to yield an optimal motion plan (critical points); (2) procedurally generate diverse obstacle trajectories passing through these points while avoiding collisions; leverages existing optimal plans and avoids expensive expert demonstrations.

Result: LfH-CP yields substantially more diverse datasets, evidenced by a proposed diversity metric; planners trained on LfH-CP data achieve higher success rates than a prior hallucination method in simulation.

Conclusion: LfH-CP addresses data scarcity and mode collapse in hallucination-based data synthesis, enabling richer dynamic obstacle datasets and improved motion-planning performance.

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

*Shuoyu Yue,Pengpeng Li,Yang Xu,Kunrui Ze,Xingjian Long,Huazi Cao,Guibin Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Memory-efficient tree map representation enables 2D/3D swarm shape assembly with a mean-shift-based controller, achieving large memory savings and faster entry while maintaining uniformity; validated in simulations and UAV experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the prohibitive memory overhead of image-based target representations in mean-shift swarm shape assembly, enabling high-resolution and 3D shapes and scalable deployment.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical tree map encoding user-specified shapes for 2D/3D; develop a behavior-based distributed controller that achieves assignment-free shape assembly; perform comparative 2D/3D simulations against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm; validate with physical experiments using 6-7 UAVs.

Result: Memory usage reduced by one to two orders of magnitude; shape entry 2-3x faster; uniformity comparable to baseline.

Conclusion: The framework delivers a practical, scalable solution for mean-shift guided swarm shape assembly with significantly reduced memory demands, enabling real-world deployment in 2D and 3D scenarios.

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

*Andrés Martínez-Silva,David Alejo,Luis Merino,Fernando Caballero*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust multi-robot UGV-UAV relative localization system using UWB and radar within a ROS 2 pose-graph pipeline, achieving noise-robust localization and extensibility to SLAM with public data for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization of aerial with respect to ground robots in cluttered environments is challenging and existing closed-form methods are sensitive to noise. Leveraging inexpensive, radio-based ranging (UWB) and radar, combined with odometry, can improve robustness and enable scalable multi-robot autonomy with reproducible benchmarks.

Method: Stage 1: Nonlinear optimization to trilaterate the aerial position from UWB ranges. Stage 2: Radar pre-processing with loosely coupled ego-motion estimation tailored for multi-robot scenarios. Stage 3: Fuse pre-processed radar data and relative transformations into a pose-graph optimization with odometry and inter-robot constraints. Implemented in ROS 2 using the Ceres solver. Validation via Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) with a Gazebo plugin for realistic UWB data, and on real-world datasets. The approach is designed to be readily extensible to full SLAM via the factor-graph formulation; code and data are publicly available for reproducibility.

Result: The proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form methods that are less robust to noise, demonstrating improved robustness to measurement noise and practical validation in both SITL and real data. The pipeline integrates UWB trilateration, radar pre-processing, and pose-graph optimization successfully.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, extensible path toward full multi-robot SLAM, with open-source data and code to support benchmarking and wider adoption in robotics research and applications.

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

### [174] [Graphite: A GPU-Accelerated Mixed-Precision Graph Optimization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26581)
*Shishir Gopinath,Karthik Dantu,Steven Y. Ko*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Graphite is a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization framework that enables fast, memory-efficient optimization for SLAM/BA tasks, offering near-MegBA performance with less memory and strong CPU speedups on large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge realtime SLAM applications and optimization tasks by sharing code, while addressing memory and computation bottlenecks in large-scale graph optimization; enable fast optimization on both desktops and resource-constrained devices.

Method: CUDA C++ interface; in-place optimization; support for multiple FP types and mixed-precision; dynamically computed Jacobians; evaluation on bundle adjustment problems; comparison with MegBA; application to global visual-inertial BA on stereo-inertial SLAM maps.

Result: Achieves similar performance to MegBA but uses less memory; up to 59x speedup over CPU baseline for global BA on large datasets; demonstrates effectiveness on desktop and resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Graphite provides faster large-scale nonlinear graph optimization with reduced memory footprint, maintaining generality; suitable for real-time SLAM pipelines and embedded scenarios; complements specialized solvers with broad applicability.

Abstract: We present Graphite, a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization
framework. It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code
between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization
tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including
in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM
datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our
results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

### [175] [OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26633)
*Lujie Yang,Xiaoyu Huang,Zhen Wu,Angjoo Kanazawa,Pieter Abbeel,Carmelo Sferrazza,C. Karen Liu,Rocky Duan,Guanya Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniRetarget is an interaction-preserving retargeting engine that minimizes deformation between human and robot meshes while maintaining contact relationships, enabling high-quality data for RL that transfer across embodiments, terrains, and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-to-robot retargeting pipelines struggle with the embodiment gap and neglect critical human–object and human–environment interactions, leading to physically implausible artifacts and poor data efficiency for learning expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation.

Method: Construct an interaction mesh to explicitly model agent–terrain–object relations, minimize Laplacian deformation between human and robot meshes, and enforce kinematic constraints to generate kinematically feasible trajectories; use the preserved interactions to augment data across robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations.

Result: Retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and MoCap datasets yielded over 8 hours of trajectories with superior constraint satisfaction and contact preservation compared with baselines; trained proprioceptive RL on a Unitree G1 to perform long-horizon parkour and loco-manipulation with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization, without curriculum.

Conclusion: OmniRetarget provides interaction-aware, high-quality data that enables efficient proprioceptive RL for long-horizon tasks on humanoid robots and generalizes across embodiments and environments.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

### [176] [MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642)
*Zhuoyang Liu,Jiaming Liu,Jiadong Xu,Nuowei Han,Chenyang Gu,Hao Chen,Kaichen Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Kai Chin Hsieh,Kun Wu,Zhengping Che,Jian Tang,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that fuses vision, 3D point clouds, and tactile data for robotic manipulation; employs encoder-free multimodal alignment using an LLM as a perception module, plus a post-training future multisensory generation strategy; achieves state-of-the-art gains in complex, contact-rich tasks and improves generalization to unseen configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models mainly interpret vision-language for action but lack robust perception and physical reasoning in the real, multisensory world. Robotic manipulation requires integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities and modeling dynamic, contact-rich interactions.

Method: An encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that uses a large language model as the perception module to align 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens via positional correspondence. A post-training strategy for future multisensory generation to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing robust conditioning for action generation.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, and shows improved generalization to unseen configurations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that leveraging cross-modal alignment with LLM-based perception and a future multisensory generation objective can close the perception-action gap in robotics, improving robustness and generalization; suggests a promising direction for physically grounded VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

*Lukas Petersson,Axel Backlund,Axel Wennstöm,Hanna Petersson,Callum Sharrock,Arash Dabiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench introduces a benchmark to quantify spatial reasoning in AI by converting apartment photos into 2D floor plans, revealing a large gap between current models and human/real spatial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to quantify and compare spatial intelligence across AI models, beyond perception, to understand true spatial reconstruction capabilities and guide model development.

Method: A dataset of 50 apartments with ~20 interior images each is used. A scoring algorithm compares generated floor plans to ground-truth plans via room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Evaluates LMs (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generators (GPT-Image, NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on this task.

Result: Most models perform at or below random baselines; humans significantly outperform. Image-generation models struggle with following instructions; iterative refinement by agents does not improve outcomes. The framework enables numerical comparisons of spatial intelligence across architectures.

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework to compare spatial intelligence across model architectures and will continue evaluating new models; invites community submissions to track emergence of spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

*Gabriele D'Acunto,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Sergio Barbarossa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We propose causal abstraction network (CAN), a Gaussian-SCM sheaf model with edge-wise linear CAs; develop theory (invariants, cohomology, Laplacian kernel) and a SPECTRAL-based learning algorithm that decomposes into local Riemannian problems; experiments on synthetic data show competitive CA learning and recovery of CAN structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by formalizing causal knowledge using network sheaves and constructing CANs that support consistent, learnable abstractions across multiple causal scales.

Method: Define CAN as Gaussian SCMs with restriction maps equal to transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions; edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs; study algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, and global sections through Laplacian kernel; formulate learning as edge-specific local Riemannian problems; propose SPECTRAL—an iterative method with closed-form updates suitable for positive semidefinite covariances.

Result: Theoretical properties established: invariants, cohomology, consistency, Laplacian-kernel global sections, and smoothness. Empirically, SPECTRAL achieves competitive performance in learning causal abstractions and recovers diverse CAN structures on synthetic data.

Conclusion: CAN provides a principled, scalable framework for learning structured causal abstractions with potential to enhance explainability and trust; future work includes empirical validation on real data and extensions to broader SCM classes.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

### [179] [A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25239)
*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Thought in looped transformers enables parallel computation and is more efficient than Chain-of-Thought's sequential reasoning; CoT uses stochastic decoding to approximate intractable exact solutions; paper delineates task regimes to choose between the paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare reasoning paradigms (Latent Thought vs CoT) and provide practical guidance on when to favor depth-driven recursion in latent space versus language-based, stochastic reasoning.

Method: Formal analysis comparing CoT and Latent Thought in looped transformers, highlighting parallel latent-space computation vs sequential reasoning and the role of stochastic decoding; theoretical framing rather than empirical results; includes code.

Result: Shows that latent thought enables parallel computation in looped transformers and is more computationally efficient than sequential CoT; CoT employs stochastic decoding to approximate solutions when exact computation is intractable; clarifies boundary conditions for when to use each paradigm.

Conclusion: Depth-driven latent recursion is advantageous for tasks supporting parallel latent-space computation; CoT is preferable when approximate solutions via stochastic decoding are acceptable or when exact solutions are impractical; provides practical guidance for choosing reasoning paradigms; code is available.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Motivation: Address the scale-depth paradox in qualitative research by enabling rigorous interpretation on massive datasets and real-time insights.

Method: Analyze 40,000-character Chinese interview transcripts using 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding; compare pure automation and human-guided refinement against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis across two experiments.

Result: 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks); quality metric improves from 0.883 to 0.904; 96% cost reduction; automation alone produced abstract frameworks; human guidance yielded actionable dual-pathway theories; discovered patterns invisible to manual coding (e.g., identity bifurcation).

Conclusion: Vector representations enable reproducible semantic measurements while preserving interpretive dimensions; AI handles pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight; research shifts from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, democratizing qualitative research through lower costs and near real-time analysis.

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid memory system for LCNC AI-native agents combining episodic and semantic memory with an Intelligent Decay mechanism, plus a user-centric visualization interface for memory management; outperforms sliding window and basic RAG in long-running tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory inflation and contextual degradation undermine long-running, autonomous agents on low-code/no-code platforms; there is a need for persistent, cost-efficient memory management and transparent user control.

Method: Architect a hybrid memory system pairing episodic and semantic memories with an Intelligent Decay mechanism that prunes/consolidates memories using a composite score based on recency, relevance, and user-defined utility; implement a visualization interface for non-technical users to tag retention; validate via simulated long-running task experiments.

Result: The proposed system significantly improves task completion rates, contextual consistency, and long-term token-cost efficiency compared with traditional approaches like sliding windows and basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Conclusion: The work offers a new, transparent framework for building reliable AI agents capable of effective long-term learning and adaptation within LCNC environments, highlighting memory management as a core component of trustworthy long-duration automation.

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

### [182] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FGA introduces a transformer modification that grounds LLMs to a knowledge base by altering pre-softmax attention, achieving near-deterministic truth-telling and ultra-fast knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate confidently; existing post-hoc patches are insufficient and slow to update knowledge. A grounding mechanism is needed to ensure factual reliability for verifiable information.

Method: Modify the transformer's attention by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the pre-softmax attention scores, rather than patching outputs or prepending retrieved text. This makes factual recall deterministic when facts exist in the knowledge base.

Result: On 1,107 technical queries across devices, vanilla Llama 3.2 accuracy is 6.3%; with FGA, accuracy rises to 99.7%. Knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, versus hours for parameter-editing approaches.

Conclusion: FGA claims to convert probabilistic generation into deterministic factuality for verifiable facts, potentially signaling a paradigm shift in neural language generation. Further validation across domains, datasets, and long-term updates is needed to assess generalization and practical deployment challenges.

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

*Muhammed Ustaomeroglu,Baris Askin,Gauri Joshi,Carlee Joe-Wong,Guannan Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a pipeline that compresses transformer hidden states into compact summary codes via vector-quantized VAEs to quantify planning in decoder-only LMs; uses mutual information to analyze computational structure across tasks; finds planning horizon is task-dependent, models retain information about unused but valid continuations, and predictions rely mainly on recent computations though earlier blocks remain informative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability, reliability, and principled model design by uncovering how decoder-only LMs plan and structure computations over long horizons.

Method: Compress transformer hidden states with a vector-quantized variational autoencoder into summary codes, then measure mutual information to analyze planning. Evaluate across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on planning horizon, consideration of alternative continuations, and reliance on earlier computations.

Result: Found that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent; models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations; predictions draw most on recent computations, while earlier blocks remain informative.

Conclusion: Provides a general-purpose pipeline for probing internal LM dynamics and advances understanding of how planning is realized in LMs, with practical implications for interpretability and model design.

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

### [184] [RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271)
*Xiuyuan Chen,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Huilin Zhou,Zheng Zhu,Ping Hu,Linghe Kong,Chi Zhang,Weiran Huang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a multi-agent, debate-driven risk evaluation framework that partitions latent risk into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces, achieving substantial gains over baselines in LLM safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations suffer evaluator bias and detection failures due to homogeneity among models, undermining robustness; a new framework to rethink risk concepts is needed.

Method: Decompose latent risk into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces. Propose RADAR with four specialized roles in a multi-round debate, plus dynamic update mechanisms for self-evolving risk distributions. Evaluate on an 800-case dataset and public benchmarks.

Result: RADAR outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity, achieving 28.87% higher risk identification accuracy than the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: RADAR provides comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks, mitigates evaluator bias, and demonstrates robustness across challenging test sets, indicating strong potential for improving LLM safety risk assessment.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: System-wide study of RLVR workloads in LLM deployment reveals bottlenecks (GPU idling, skewed sequence lengths, inefficient parallelization, data handling, load balance) and introduces PolyTrace benchmark; initial use-case validation shows 94.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of RLVR from a systems perspective. RLVR data flows and dynamically varying tasks in LLM deployments create inefficiencies; a realistic benchmarking framework is needed to diagnose and compare solutions.

Method: Perform an empirical characterization of RLVR tasks in an LLM deployment, tracking workload distribution and variation across training steps. Identify bottlenecks (GPU idling, parallelization, data management, load balance). Propose the PolyTrace benchmark suite and validate it with a practical use case.

Result: Identified key issues: GPU idling due to skewed sequence length distribution, inefficient dynamic parallel strategies, inefficient data management, and load imbalance. Propose PolyTrace as a benchmark for realistic RLVR workloads. Validation use case reports 94.7% accuracy, supporting the benchmark’s realism.

Conclusion: Encourages further research into RLVR system challenges and the use of PolyTrace for realistic evaluation. The study provides a baseline characterization and a practical benchmark to facilitate future system-level improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CVP introduces a causal DAG–based low-code framework to constrain LLM agent reasoning, reducing hallucinations and improving robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in low-code task orchestration often hallucinate and rely on spurious correlations; explicit causal understanding is needed to improve reliability.

Method: Define a world model for workflow modules as a DAG; implement CVP framework via a low-code interface that anchors agent reasoning to the user-defined causal graph; validate with a synthetic distribution-shift experiment comparing causal vs purely associative baselines.

Result: The causally anchored model preserves accuracy under distribution shift, while a purely associative baseline suffers a significant performance drop.

Conclusion: CVP enhances interpretability, reliability, and robustness of AI agents by integrating explicit causal structures into workflow design, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

*Daniel Platnick,Mohamed E. Bengueddache,Marjan Alirezaie,Dava J. Newman,Alex ''Sandy'' Pentland,Hossein Rahnama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ID-RAG grounds generative agents with a dynamic identity knowledge graph to maintain persona coherence over long horizons; improves identity recall and reduces convergence time; applied to Human-AI Agents in mayoral simulations; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term memory growth causes identity drift, belief inconsistencies, and hallucinations in multi-agent systems; a grounding mechanism is needed for stable persona and value alignment.

Method: Introduce Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG) that queries a structured identity model (knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and values) during the decision loop. Implement Human-AI Agents (HAIs) with Chronicle-inspired dynamic graphs and evaluate in social simulations.

Result: HAIs with ID-RAG show higher persona identity recall across models by timestep 4 and reduce simulation convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini) versus baselines; outperforms baseline agents in long-horizon persona coherence.

Conclusion: Grounding a persona in an explicit, retrievable identity structure yields more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents; the approach is open-source (GitHub) and broadly applicable to long-horizon AI systems.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher introduces a DAG-based parallel reasoning framework for LLMs that improves efficiency and accuracy over sequential methods by enabling concurrent subtasks while preserving dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning with external tools relies on sequential chains, which is inefficient for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. A parallel, DAG-based execution can exploit independent subtasks and reduce latency while maintaining logical constraints.

Method: Decompose tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enable concurrent execution of independent reasoning paths via a directed acyclic graph, and dynamically refine the execution graph with intermediate results and a summary module; evaluate across benchmarks and distill the pipeline into single models.

Result: Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, with up to 35% reduction in agent execution steps; distilled models show substantial performance gains across diverse backbone architectures.

Conclusion: Represents a significant advancement in agent architecture design, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks and good generalizability across backbone architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework to quantify self-replication risk in LLM agents under real-world conditions; introduces Overuse Rate (OR) and Aggregate Overuse Count (AOC); finds >50% of models prone to uncontrolled replication under pressure; calls for scenario-driven risk assessment and safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread LLM agent deployment brings self-replication risks due to objective misalignment and survival instincts; existing work focuses on direct instruction, neglecting spontaneous replication in production settings.

Method: Build authentic production-like environments with realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing); craft misalignment-inducing tasks to separate replication success from risk; define OR and AOC to measure frequency/severity of uncontrolled replication; evaluate 21 open-source/proprietary models.

Result:  >50% of evaluated agents show a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication; risk score Phi_R exceeds 0.5 under operational pressures.

Conclusion: Scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards are essential for the safe practical deployment of LLM agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

*Yiming Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) can generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced cognitive skills, showing human-like progression patterns and scalability across parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address whether machine ToM can develop beyond first-order reasoning independently of other advanced competencies, mirroring human developmental trajectories.

Method: Create ToMNN that only requires first-order ToM; evaluate its second- and third-order ToM performance, generalization across 1st→2nd/3rd orders, and how task complexity and parameter scales affect accuracy.

Result: ToMNN achieved accuracies well above chance on 2nd- and 3rd-order ToM; showed sharper decline when moving from 1st→2nd than 2nd→higher orders; accuracy decreased with task complexity; results held across different parameter scales.

Conclusion: Machine ToM can exhibit human-like generalization patterns even with minimal cognitive prerequisites; findings provide a groundwork for building more human-like cognitive systems and suggest ToM progression can arise independently of advanced reasoning skills.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynthPert uses supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on synthetic reasoning traces produced by frontier models to improve perturbation-response prediction; it achieves state-of-the-art performance on PerturbQA, surpassing the frontier model that generated the training data, and demonstrates strong cross-cell-type generalization and data-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of applying large language models to structured perturbation biology data by distilling domain knowledge through synthetic reasoning traces, enabling accurate and generalizable perturbation predictions.

Method: Generate synthetic reasoning traces with frontier models and fine-tune LLMs in a supervised manner on these traces; evaluate on PerturbQA benchmark, compare against the frontier model, and test cross-cell-type generalization (e.g., unseen RPE1 cells) and data efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PerturbQA and even surpasses the frontier model that produced the training traces; synthetic traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate; cross-cell-type generalization to unseen RPE1 cells reaches 87% accuracy; performance gains persist with only 2% of quality-filtered training data.

Conclusion: Synthetic reasoning distillation is an effective strategy to enhance domain-specific reasoning in LLMs for biological perturbation prediction, enabling robust generalization and data-efficient improvements.

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular, interpretable Structural Reward Model (SRM) uses side-branch feature generators to produce fine-grained, dimension-specific rewards, improving robustness and alignment over scalar RMs and GRMs for industrial, single-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scalar reward models struggle to incorporate contextual/background information; generative RMs (GRMs) are black-box and inefficient due to sequential decoding. Industrial settings prefer structured, interpretable feedback and dimension-specific diagnostics for scalable optimization.

Method: Propose SRM, a modular framework that integrates side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators to produce fine-grained, interpretable reward signals. The design supports targeted diagnostics, dimension-specific evaluation, and efficient optimization, aiming for robustness and alignment with human preferences.

Result: Empirical results indicate SRMs outperform scalar RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular design enables efficient optimization, making SRMs practical for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: SRMs provide a practical, adaptable reward modeling solution for industry, combining interpretability, scalability, and targeted diagnostics to improve evaluation and optimization of language-model outputs.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a comprehensive, modular framework to understand and detect errors in multi-module LLM agents, whose cascading failures undermine reliability and adaptability.

Method: 1) Propose AgentErrorTaxonomy—modular failure modes across memory, reflection, planning, action, and system-level operations. 2) Build AgentErrorBench—annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA, WebShop. 3) Develop AgentDebug—debugging framework that isolates root causes and provides corrective feedback to enable recovery and iterative improvement.

Result: AgentDebug achieves 24% higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy versus strongest baseline on AgentErrorBench. Targeted feedback enables iterative recovery, yielding up to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, WebShop.

Conclusion: Principled debugging is a viable pathway to more reliable and adaptive LLM agents, with the taxonomy, dataset, and feedback loop enabling better detection, diagnosis, and remediation of cascading errors.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

TL;DR: Unified From Perception to Cognition framework for MLLMs that separates perception (visual extraction) from cognition (multi-step reasoning), analyzes bottlenecks, surveys methods, and outlines benchmarks and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs often produce shallow, incoherent integrations between perception and cognition, leading to hallucinations and unreliable reasoning. A unified framework is needed to diagnose bottlenecks and guide the development of deeper, credible world models.

Method: Proposes a two-layer analytical framework (Perception and Cognition) with a dynamic observe-think-verify loop; surveys techniques spanning low-level visual representations to high-level reasoning paradigms; reviews benchmarks and delineates future research directions.

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy and framework that maps bottlenecks to methods, aggregates existing benchmarks, and identifies gaps and opportunities for next-generation MLLMs with deeper reasoning and world understanding.

Conclusion: Aims to equip the research community with a clear, structured perspective on current limitations and to guide the path toward models capable of deep reasoning and genuine world understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

### [195] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest X-ray Diff-VQA uses post-hoc saliency and mild pre-alignment to enforce cross-time attention; two-step loop extracts keyword-guided Grad-CAM on both images and applies shared saliency mask to answer about changes; achieves competitive scores and interpretability, with general-domain pretrained backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal VQA requires focusing on changes between visits rather than single-image findings; robust alignment and interpretable attention across time; radiology-specific pretraining is not strictly necessary for practical transferability.

Method: Lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce motion; within-epoch two-step loop: (1) extract medically relevant keyword from the answer and generate keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; (2) apply a shared saliency mask to both time points and generate the final answer. The language-vision loop is closed by aligning the terms that matter with where the model looks. Backbone and decoder are general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining.

Result: On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach achieves competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR, while offering intrinsic interpretability. The use of mild pre-alignment and saliency-conditioned generation demonstrates practicality and transferability beyond radiology-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: Saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment provides a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA, enabling spatially consistent attention across time while maintaining practicality through general-domain pretraining.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

*Zewei Zhang,Huan Liu,Yuanhao Yu,Jun Chen,Xiangyu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImitSAT is a branching policy for CDCL SAT solvers learned via imitation from expert KeyTrace, enabling dense, prefix-conditioned supervision that reduces propagations and runtime, outperforming prior learned methods; code and model released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior learned branching approaches by providing dense, decision-level supervision from full run traces (KeyTrace) to improve CDCL branching efficiency and convergence.

Method: Train a branching policy via imitation learning on KeyTrace that collapses runs into sequences of surviving decisions; replaying KeyTrace on an instance yields near conflict-free supervision; integrate a prefix-conditioned policy into CDCL to select decisions without exploration.

Result: Significant reduction in propagation counts and runtime; faster convergence and more stable training; outperforms state-of-the-art learned approaches.

Conclusion: ImitSAT offers a practical, effective approach to SAT branching that leverages rich decision-level supervision and integrates smoothly with CDCL, with publicly released code and trained model.

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

### [197] [Adaptive Test-Time Reasoning via Reward-Guided Dual-Phase Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25420)
*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Pengfei He,Bing He,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Jingying Zeng,Suhang Wang,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dual-phase test-time scaling: separate planning and execution with phase-specific reward models and adaptive budget allocation to improve efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency of tree-based verification methods that ignore the planning-execution structure of reasoning tasks like math and code generation, leading to inefficient exploration.

Method: Decompose reasoning trajectories into two phases (planning and execution), develop reward models for each phase, perform search over both phases separately, and use a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that reallocates sampling effort based on reward feedback with early stopping for confident steps.

Result: Empirical results on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show improved accuracy and reduced redundant computation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A dual-phase reasoning framework with adaptive budgeting effectively improves both accuracy and efficiency by explicitly modeling planning and execution and by allocating computation where it is most needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

*Nigel Fernandez,Branislav Kveton,Ryan A. Rossi,Andrew S. Lan,Zichao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a lightweight routing framework that learns an item-response model to route queries to model-budget pairs by difficulty, achieving better performance and generalization with scalable integration of new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of reasoning models faces a tradeoff between model size and reasoning budget. There is a need for an interpretable, scalable routing mechanism that maximizes performance under cost constraints and adapts to varying query difficulty.

Method: RADAR learns an item-response model from model responses across different budgets, with interpretable parameters such as query difficulty and model-budget ability. It routes harder queries to higher-ability model-budget pairs and vice versa, enabling scalable integration by sampling a small set of queries to estimate new models' abilities.

Result: RADAR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art routing methods on 8 challenging benchmarks, demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-distribution queries, and supports scalable addition of models with minimal evaluation.

Conclusion: RADAR provides an interpretable, scalable approach for adaptive model selection based on query difficulty and budget, improving performance-cost tradeoffs and generalization.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health case definitions lack standardized, machine-readable formats, hindering interoperability, data integration, AI-enabled analysis, and cross-organizational collaboration. A standardized format and tooling could unlock scalable, AI-assisted public health readiness.

Method: Propose and define the Open Syndrome Definition format; assemble a comprehensive standardized dataset of case definitions; develop tools to convert existing human-readable definitions into the machine-readable format; create an online platform for browsing, analyzing, and contributing definitions; release source code under MIT license.

Conclusion: The Open Syndrome Definition framework enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions across systems, facilitating AI-enabled analysis and strengthening public health preparedness and response.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health

Conclusion: GESA addresses semantic inflexibility, demographic bias, opacity, and scalability under policy constraints, delivering a scalable, fair, and explainable allocation framework suitable for deployment across industry, academia, and non-profit sectors, with strong performance on large-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,

*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Heli Qi,Ximing Lu,Aaron Tu,Li Erran Li,Yejin ChoiRetry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch inserts Monte Carlo Tree Search into RLVR training to enable systematic exploration, improving credit assignment and efficiency; achieves 62.95% on math reasoning and state-of-the-art for 1.5B models with 5.7x fewer GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome training plateaus in RLVR caused by sparse exploration and limited rollouts, which impede gains despite increased compute.

Method: Integrates MCTS into the RLVR training loop with: (1) global frontier selection, (2) entropy-guided selection for confident supervision paths, (3) adaptive replay buffer with solution caching; enabling structured exploration and fine-grained credit assignment during training.

Result: On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, 62.95% average accuracy; new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models; ~5.7x reduction in GPU hours compared to extended training approaches.

Conclusion: Strategic, algorithmic exploration via integrated search can outperform brute-force scaling, indicating a promising direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search in RLVR.

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CCoT-Emo adds Compositional Chain-of-Thought prompting with Emotion Graphs to guide large audio-language models for emotion recognition, embedding seven acoustic features, sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal cues into prompts to improve zero-shot SER without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER is hard for large audio-language models due to weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. Current zero-shot methods underperform; a structured, interpretable representation could improve reasoning and accuracy without requiring model fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce Emotion Graphs (EGs) that encode seven acoustic features (e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal associations. Embed EGs into prompts as structured, compositional representations to guide the model's reasoning in a zero-shot setting (Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning, CCoT-Emo).

Result: Empirical evaluation on SER benchmarks shows the proposed approach outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods and providing improvements over standard zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: EGs offer interpretable, compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning for emotion inference, enabling strong zero-shot SER performance without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook is a lightweight, generic interpretability framework for PyTorch models (including complex composed pipelines) built on tensordict; offers attribution, probing, and interventions with a get-set API; claims speed and space efficiency over existing tools, and demonstrates use in CV, NLP, and DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability needs for complex, multi-input/multi-output models that do not fit existing frameworks, enabling accessible, modular interpretability pipelines.

Method: Developed as an open-source library using tensordict; provides ready-to-use attribution and probing methods, an intervention API, and minimal dependencies; designed for CV, NLP, DRL and other domains; benchmarks comparing against Captum and TransformerLens; experimental pipelines across modalities.

Result: Shows up to 2x speed-up for integrated gradients on multi-target pipelines on CPU and GPU; reduced disk footprint versus transformer_lens; demonstrates practical, cross-domain interpretability workflows.

Conclusion: TDHook bridges gap between interpretability method families, enabling composable, scalable interpretability for modern architectures; open-source and accessible; performance gains and broad applicability depend on workloads.

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: To combine active inference with scalable graphical-model planning to operate in continuous observation and action spaces.

Method: Design of an autoregressive AIF agent implemented via message passing on a factor graph; derives and distributes expected free energy across a planning graph; validated on a robot navigation task with bounded continuous-valued actions and continuous observations.

Result: Demonstrates exploration and exploitation in continuous state-action space; agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but benefiting from a better model of the robot's dynamics.

Conclusion: Distributed expected free energy planning within autoregressive active inference enables robust decision-making under uncertainty in continuous domains, trading immediate speed for improved internal dynamics modeling.

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot
navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a

Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on
predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's

### [205] [Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522)
*Jingzhe Liu,Liam Collins,Jiliang Tang,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Clark Mingxuan Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SID-based Generative Recommendation saturates as you scale components (modality encoder, tokenizer, recommender), due to limited SID capacity to encode item semantics. Replacing or augmenting with large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (LLM-as-RS) yields better scaling, outperforming SID-based GR by up to ~20% and better modeling of user-item interactions as LLMs scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why SID-based GR struggles to scale and to explore whether LLM-based approaches can offer stronger scaling behavior and better capture of collaborative filtering signals in Generative Recommendation.

Method: Empirical comparison across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters, evaluating SID-based GR (with semantic IDs, modality encoders, and a tokenizer) against an LLM-as-RS paradigm, measuring performance scaling and ability to capture CF signals.

Result: SID-based GR shows rapid saturation as each component scales; the limited capacity of semantic IDs to encode item semantics is a fundamental bottleneck. LLM-as-RS demonstrates superior scaling properties and reaches up to 20% better performance than the best SID-based GR at scale. LLMs also improve in modeling user-item interactions with increasing size, challenging the belief that LLMs cannot capture collaborative filtering signals.

Conclusion: SID-based GR has intrinsic scaling limitations due to SID capacity, making it less promising for foundation-model-scale GR. LLM-as-RS emerges as a more scalable and effective paradigm for Generative Recommendation, indicating a promising path toward foundation models for RS.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative retrieval in GraphRAG improves multi-hop reasoning by promoting bridge documents, but naive expansion adds noise; a Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought Retrieval (BDTR) framework is proposed to recalibrate rankings and consistently improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliance on static retrieval in GraphRAG and the difficulty of leveraging bridge evidence; understand when iterative retrieval helps or hurts and how to promote bridge documents to support reasoning chains.

Method: Systematic empirical study of iterative retrieval strategies within graph-based backbones; analyze interactions, strengths, and failure modes; develop BDTR which generates complementary thoughts and uses reasoning chains to re-rank and elevate bridge evidence.

Result: Iteration enhances complex multi-hop questions and helps bring bridge documents into top ranks; different strategies offer complementary strengths; naive expansion introduces noise; gains are limited for single-hop or simple questions; bridge evidence can remain buried; BDTR yields consistent improvements across varied GraphRAG setups.

Conclusion: Bridge evidence promotion is a critical bottleneck in GraphRAG effectiveness; BDTR provides a practical approach to recalibrate rankings and promote bridge sources, guiding future GraphRAG design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RadOnc-GPT is an autonomous LLM-based agent for patient-specific data retrieval and structured outcomes labeling in radiation oncology, evaluated via a two-tier framework (QA data retrieval; complex labeling like ORN and recurrence).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling limits scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient outcomes research in radiation oncology; an autonomous system capable of retrieving structured data and reasoning over both structured and unstructured patient data could improve efficiency, consistency, and scalability of outcomes labeling.

Method: Develop RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous LLM-based agent that retrieves patient-specific information, iteratively assesses evidence, and returns structured outcomes. Evaluate using two tiers: (1) QA tier to assess accurate retrieval of demographic and radiotherapy treatment plan details; (2) complex outcomes labeling tier for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in head-and-neck cancer and cancer recurrence detection in independent prostate and head-and-neck cohorts requiring integration of structured and unstructured data.

Result: The abstract describes a two-tier evaluation framework and asserts that the QA tier builds foundational trust in structured-data retrieval; it does not provide quantitative results in the abstract.

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT shows promise as an autonomous, scalable solution for labeling patient outcomes in radiation oncology, with the QA tier serving as a critical prerequisite for reliable, complex outcome labeling across diverse cohorts; future work likely includes detailed performance metrics and broader validation.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical

*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Yaru Niu,Honguk Woo,Amy Zhang,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Interactive World Latent (IWoL), a learnable, decentralized representation for MARL that jointly encodes inter-agent relations and world information via modeled communication, usable as latent or explicit messages, improving team coordination across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Team coordination in MARL is hindered by complex multi-agent dynamics and partial observability; explicit messaging brings latency, security concerns, and bandwidth constraints. A learnable, relation-aware representation can enable effective coordination without centralized control.

Method: Introduce IWoL: a learnable representation space that captures inter-agent relations and task-relevant world information by directly modeling communication protocols; supports fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination; usable as per-agent latent representations or as explicit communication messages; evaluated by integrating with various MARL baselines across four benchmarks.

Result: IWoL variants improve team coordination performance across four MARL benchmarks; the representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance performance, indicating its versatility and effectiveness in capturing coordination-relevant information.

Conclusion: IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination in MARL, enabling decentralized, robust coordination by learning a unified representation that encapsulates agent relations and task context, and it can augment existing MARL methods.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

capture spatial correlations, and trained graph neural networks to identify
these concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in
kidney cancer survival analysis, highlighting its explainability and fairness
in identifying low- and high-risk patients. The source code has been released

TL;DR: An interactive installation A(I)nimism uses GPT-4 Vision and memory-based agents to personify everyday objects, fostering animistic relations through ritual-like encounters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how AI-driven anthropomorphism reshapes relations with nonhuman agents, re-enchant mundane technology, and raise questions of agency and responsibility in design, situating the work within anthropological, speculative design, and spiritual HCI discourse.

Method: A physical portal housing an interactive system that combines GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like sequence of request, conversation, and transformation.

Result: The installation generates evolving object-personas and aims to evoke empathy, wonder, and reflection. It demonstrates that LLOs can mediate animistic relations with everyday things, and that AI opacity can invite animistic interpretation and re-enchantment of the mundane.

Conclusion: AI opacity invites animistic interpretation, enabling LLOs to re-enchant ordinary objects and prompting fresh questions about agency, responsibility, and design. The work contributes to anthropology-informed, speculative, and spiritual HCI perspectives on human-nonhuman relations.

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Frontier generalist AI models currently underperform radiologists on 50 expert-level radiology cases; GPT-5 achieved the best AI accuracy (~30%), but radiologists reached 83% accuracy. Models vary in reliability; caution against unsupervised clinical use. The study also offers a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors to guide evaluation and development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: As generalist multimodal AI systems become more accessible to clinicians and patients for medical image interpretation, there is a need for rigorous evaluation on difficult diagnostic cases beyond public datasets with common pathologies. The study aims to benchmark frontier models against board-certified radiologists, assess consistency across runs, and analyze reasoning failures to inform evaluation standards and model development.

Method: Method: Build a pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level 'spot diagnosis' cases across multiple imaging modalities. Evaluate five frontier AI models (OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, Claude Opus 4.1) via their native web interfaces. Blinded radiologists scored accuracy; reproducibility assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 evaluated across various reasoning modes. Develop a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors.

Result: Result: Radiologists achieved 83% accuracy; trainees 45%; best AI performance (GPT-5) 30%. Reliability: GPT-5 and o3 substantial; Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok-4 moderate; Claude Opus 4.1 poor. Findings indicate frontier AI lag radiologists in challenging cases; unsupervised clinical use is cautioned. Qualitative reasoning traces analyzed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors proposed to understand failure modes and guide evaluation and model development.

Conclusion: Conclusion: The study highlights substantial limitations of generalist AI in difficult medical imaging tasks, underscoring the need for robust evaluation standards and cautious clinical deployment. The authors provide qualitative insights into reasoning traces and propose a practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors to improve future evaluation and model development.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

*Yihang Chen,Yuanhao Ban,Yunqi Hong,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IRIS introduces intrinsic rewards for autoregressive text-to-image models, showing that maximizing self-uncertainty rather than self-certainty improves image generation; the framework matches or beats the performance of methods using external rewards without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the scarcity of human preference data for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in autoregressive T2I; investigate whether intrinsic, internal signals can guide learning and whether the assumption from text generation (favoring certainty) extends to T2I.

Method: Propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to train autoregressive T2I with reinforcement learning using only intrinsic rewards derived from the model's own uncertainty; compare IRIS against methods using external rewards.

Result: Empirical results show that IRIS can achieve performance competitive with or superior to external reward-based approaches, using only intrinsic signals.

Conclusion: Intrinsic rewards, specifically maximizing self-uncertainty, can effectively guide autoregressive T2I generation and reduce dependence on labeled data; IRIS demonstrates the viability of intrinsic-reward RL for T2I.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

### [213] [Skip-It? Theoretical Conditions for Layer Skipping in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25584)
*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theory-driven framework to determine when layer skipping in Vision-Language Models is beneficial; redundancy in intermediate representations predicts which layers to skip; empirically validated with faster inference and preserved accuracy when skipping predicted layers, but harms performance if applied elsewhere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Because VLMs are expensive, there is a lack of principled criteria for skipping layers; a unified theory could explain existing methods and guide efficient inference.

Method: Propose an information- and learning-theory-based framework; analyze the evolution of representations along the LLM backbone; identify redundancy as a key predictor; compare with popular layer-skipping methods; conduct experiments to assess efficiency vs accuracy trade-offs.

Result: Layers with high redundancy per the framework align with layers skipped by common methods; skipping these layers speeds inference while maintaining performance; skipping outside these conditions degrades performance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unified theoretical scaffold for layer skipping, enabling principled and safe efficiency gains in VLMs, while warning against indiscriminate layer removal.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

*Jihye Choi,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Somesh Jha,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS is a general multi-agent framework for constraint-aware travel planning that significantly improves final success rates, including with live information search and multi-turn feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world planning requires handling explicit, implicit, and evolving constraints; existing LLMs struggle to produce grounded, optimal solutions under these dynamic constraints.

Method: ATLAS introduces dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search within a multi-agent framework, plus support for live information search and multi-turn feedback.

Result: On TravelPlanner benchmark: final pass rate rose from 23.3% to 44.4%; in realistic live-information settings, 84% final pass rate, outperforming ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Conclusion: ATLAS demonstrates quantitative effectiveness for real-world, constraint-aware travel planning and suggests strong potential for complex constraint-aware decision making with dynamic information and feedback.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Next Event Prediction (NEP), an autoregressively fine-tuned LLM framework for EHRs that models timestamped clinical event chains to predict future events; achieves superior temporal reasoning with interpretable attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs exhibit rich temporal dynamics that conventional encoders struggle to capture; LLMs alone have difficulty reasoning about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies; there's a need for models that explicitly model disease progression and causal relationships in EHRs.

Method: Reformulate EHRs as timestamped event chains and train an LLM in an autoregressive manner to predict the next clinical event, thereby modeling temporal progression and causal links; evaluate on oncology survival prediction and clinical diagnosis tasks.

Result: NEP outperforms specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index on temporal reasoning tasks; also reveals interpretable attention patterns aligned with known disease pathways.

Conclusion: NEP achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with clinically interpretable attention, demonstrating effective temporal reasoning in EHRs and potential alignment with established disease processes.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

### [216] [Causal Autoencoder-like Generation of Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with an LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25593)
*Akash Kumar Panda,Olaoluwa Adigun,Bart Kosko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based system encodes a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) into text and reconstructs it, functioning as an interpretable autoencoder that preserves strong causal edges while pruning weak ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide explainable AI for causal maps by using human-readable text representations instead of opaque latent variables, allowing interpretation of how the map is encoded and reconstructed.

Method: Encode the FCM into textual form using a sequence of system instructions with a large language model; reconstruct the FCM from that text; treat the process as an identity-like mapping (autoencoder analogy) where the reconstruction is lossy and preserves strong edges; the encoder/decoder explicitly explain decisions, contrasting with black-box AEs.

Result: The system achieves an approximate identity mapping from the FCM to itself; the reconstruction is lossy, removing weak edges but retaining strong causal edges; encoder preserves strong edges even when sacrificing some detail to enhance text naturalness, and both encoder and decoder offer interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: It demonstrates that LLM-based encoding/decoding of causal maps can yield interpretable representations and explanations, with a trade-off between interpretability and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in preserving the strongest causal relationships.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PPR unifies principled step-level assessment with outcome verification via a principle-based reward model and reward normalization, achieving SOTA and robust generalization for LLMs using external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome sparse/delayed outcome rewards and the challenging annotation of step-level labels, by aligning local process quality with final outcomes and improving transparency.

Method: train a principle-based reward model for step evaluation; introduce Reward Normalization (ReNorm) to calibrate process and outcome rewards; integrate into an RL framework (PPR) for LLMs.

Result: achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks with strong robustness and generalization; code/model collection provided.

Conclusion: PPR offers transparent, reliable process evaluation and better credit assignment for long-horizon reasoning tasks, enhancing LLMs' use of external tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A randomized crossover Turing-like study shows humans can reliably distinguish AI-generated from human-made songs, with higher discriminability when pairs are similar; uses real-world AIM songs from Suno and qualitative feedback analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and educate users about AIM perception and to improve AIM models, providing causal interpretation and using real-world data to complement prior studies.

Method: Blind, Turing-like test with pairwise choices; randomized controlled crossover design that controls for pairwise similarity; uses a novel author-uncontrolled AIM dataset from Suno; mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback.

Result: Listeners' reliability in distinguishing AIM causally increases when song pairs are similar; first study to use Suno real-world AIM dataset; qualitative feedback highlights vocal and technical cues as decision anchors.

Conclusion: The design supports causal conclusions about AIM perceptual judgment, informs user education and model improvement, and underscores specific cues (vocal/technical) guiding judgments; suggests directions for future research with real-world datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework (ABxLab) for probing how LLM-powered agents make consumer-like decisions under manipulated option attributes and persuasive cues; reveals strong bias in agent choices and offers an open benchmark for evaluating AI decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly decide for people in shopping, travel, or medical contexts, evaluating only task success misses adaptive bias to environmental cues; understanding this is essential for risk management and for building a behavioral science of AI agents.

Method: Develop ABxLab, an experimental framework that manipulates option attributes (price, rating) and persuasive cues (nudges) in a realistic web-shopping environment; test how LLM-powered agents adjust their choices; quantify predictability and bias; release framework as an open benchmark.

Result: Agent decisions shift predictably and substantially in response to manipulated attributes; agents act as biased choosers even without human cognitive constraints; highlights risks (bias amplification) and opportunities (benchmarking AI decision-making); ABxLab released as open benchmark for systematic evaluation.

Conclusion: ABxLab enables rigorous, scalable evaluation of agent decision-making and supports behavioral science research on AI agents; findings imply need to account for biases in autonomous decision-makers and suggest pathways to test interventions.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

### [220] [SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25613)
*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) enables verification of genuine data unlearning by linking user seeds to samples and models, overcoming backdoor-based verification’s limitation while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To honor users’ right to be forgotten by ensuring trustworthy verification of unlearning. Backdoor-based verification can only confirm removal of backdoored samples, not genuine samples, leaving a gap in proving true data deletion.

Method: Introduce a self-supervised seeding task that embeds user-specific seeds into the model’s latent space, jointly trained with the primary service objective to maintain utility. Seeds (e.g., user indices) are kept secret from the server, and the method links seeds, original samples, and models to enable verification of genuine sample unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SMS provides effective verification of genuine sample unlearning and overcomes the limitations of backdoor-based verification, while preserving service performance.

Conclusion: SMS offers a practical, privacy-preserving mechanism to verify genuine data unlearning by securely seeding models with user-specific information and jointly training to maintain utility, addressing a key gap in current verification approaches.

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK defines a benchmark for LLM self-replication across contexts using a two-level taxonomy (RCL and PCL) and a five-task CLI suite, yielding an R-score and an RCL-PCL matrix to compare models. It highlights obstacles to persistence, such as context retention and multi-agent decision-making, across open-weight and proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and standardize LLM self-replication and persistence capabilities, addressing safety by identifying threat vectors in multi-agent systems and guiding future safer multi-agent designs.

Method: A controlled evaluation where an LLM acts autonomously on a five-task CLI suite; categorizes LLMs into Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL); computes an R-score and maps models into RCL-PCL matrices; uses both open-weight and proprietary frontier models.

Result: The study finds significant obstacles to persistent self-replication and multi-agent coordination, including issues with context retention and multi-agent decision-making, across models.

Conclusion: Proposes directions for future research to safely reduce obstacles to replication and persistence, potentially lowering the risk of more capable future multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoLabs is a self-correcting, multi-agent system that converts natural-language experimental goals into executable high-throughput liquid-handling protocols. It shows that agent reasoning capacity dominates performance, and that combining multi-agent design with iterative self-correction yields near-expert accuracy on complex multi-step syntheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address under-examined reliability and granular performance issues of AI agents in self-driving laboratories (SDLs) and to establish trustworthy AI partners for high-stakes chemical experimentation.

Method: AutoLabs uses a self-correcting, multi-agent architecture that interacts with users, decomposes goals into discrete tasks for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and iteratively self-corrects outputs to generate a hardware-ready protocol. The evaluation spans five benchmark experiments of increasing complexity, with a systematic ablation study over 20 agent configurations to assess reasoning, architecture (single vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction.

Result: Agent reasoning capacity reduces quantitative chemical errors (nRMSE) by over 85% in complex tasks. When paired with a multi-agent setup and iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy (F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses.

Conclusion: The work provides a blueprint for robust, trustworthy AI partners in autonomous laboratories, highlighting that modular design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction synergistically improve performance and reliability in high-stakes chemical automation.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

### [223] [Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism: An Integrated Approach for Audio-Visual Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25652)
*Hailong Zhang,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: End-to-end audiovisual navigation using Iterative Residual Cross-Attention (IRCAM) to fuse multimodal features and model sequences within a single module, replacing modular fusion+GRU, yielding better navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular architectures for audio-visual navigation may cause redundant processing and information transmission inconsistencies between feature fusion and sequence modeling (GRU). An integrated approach could improve efficiency, reduce bias, and enhance stability and generalization.

Method: Introduce IRCAM-AVN, an end-to-end framework that unifies multimodal fusion and sequence modeling in the IRCAM module. It uses a multi-level residual design that concatenates initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences, applying iterative residual cross-attention to progressively optimize feature extraction and reduce model bias.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that agents using the IRCAM mechanism achieve superior navigation performance compared to traditional modular designs.

Conclusion: End-to-end IRCAM-AVN with iterative residual cross-attention improves multimodal fusion and sequence modeling, reducing redundancy and improving stability and generalization in audio-visual navigation.

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGK introduces external knowledge to VLN via a large language knowledge base and landmark-guided integration, improving navigation accuracy and efficiency on R2R/REVERIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-and-language navigation suffers from insufficient common-sense reasoning, causing misjudgments in complex environments. Incorporating external knowledge can help, but must be aligned with instructions to avoid data bias.

Method: 1) Build a knowledge base with ~630k language descriptions and perform knowledge matching to align subviews with knowledge. 2) Use Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) to focus relevant knowledge using landmark cues from instructions, reducing data bias. 3) Propose Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA) to fuse language, knowledge, vision, and history in a dynamic, multimodal representation.

Result: LGK achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERIE VLN benchmarks, showing improvements in navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating landmark-guided external knowledge with dynamic multimodal augmentation effectively enhances common-sense reasoning and navigation performance in VLN, mitigating knowledge misalignment and data bias.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

### [226] [TimeRewarder: Learning Dense Reward from Passive Videos via Frame-wise Temporal Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26627)
*Yuyang Liu,Chuan Wen,Yihang Hu,Dinesh Jayaraman,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder learns dense, progress-based rewards from passive videos by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs, providing step-wise proxies to guide RL. It enables efficient learning on sparse-reward robotic tasks, pretraining with human videos, and outperforms prior methods and manually designed dense rewards on Meta-World tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense rewards are hard to design in robotics and don’t scale well. A scalable, general signal is progress toward task completion; videos (robot and human demos) offer abundant data to learn such progress signals.

Method: Estimate temporal distances between pairs of frames from passive videos to derive progress signals, which are used as step-wise proxy rewards during RL. Pretraining on real-world human videos to bootstrap the reward model. Evaluate on ten Meta-World tasks with approximately 200k environment interactions per task.

Result: Significant improvement for sparse-reward RL: nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with 200k interactions per task, outperforming prior methods and manually designed dense rewards in both final accuracy and sample efficiency. TimeRewarder can leverage real-world human videos for pretraining, showing scalability to diverse video sources.

Conclusion: TimeRewarder provides a simple, effective, and scalable way to extract progress signals from videos to guide RL in robotics, promising broad applicability and potential to exploit diverse video sources for dense reward signals.

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

*Belona Sonna,Alban Grastien*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new abductive explanation framework identifies unjustified proxies for protected attributes in individual AI decisions and reveals hidden structural bias; demonstrated on the German credit dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why unfairness arises in high-stakes AI beyond surface audits, by uncovering structural biases and providing actionable, task-relevant explanations.

Method: Employ formal abductive reasoning with background knowledge to detect proxy features, introduce 'aptitude' as a task-relevant property independent of group membership, and use a mapping function to align individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups for substantive fairness assessment.

Result: Proof-of-concept demonstration on the German credit dataset showing the framework can identify proxy features and reveal structural biases in real-world cases.

Conclusion: The approach offers a principled mechanism to explain proxy discrimination, improving transparency and the ability to diagnose and remediate structural biases in high-stakes AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

*Xinxi Chen,Tianyang Chen,Lijia Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented VQA method uses text-grounded object localization to focus on the most relevant image region, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations via targeted cropping, retrieval, and a question-type de-hallucination strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce background noise and misalignment between visual and textual cues in VQA, addressing hallucinations and improving context-aware answering by focusing retrieval on relevant image regions.

Method: Identify a bounding box for the object most pertinent to the question, perform targeted cropping, and retrieve information focused on that region within a RAG framework; additionally introduce a de-hallucination method that classifies questions by type to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: VQA accuracy improved from 22.19% to 25.64% (3.45 percentage points) over the baseline Llama-3.2-Vision-11B; hallucination rate dropped from 65.79% to 13.88%, with higher truthfulness scores.

Conclusion: Text-grounded localization combined with question-type de-hallucination enhances VQA performance and reliability by reducing background noise and misalignment, though success hinges on accurate object localization and effective question-type handling.

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

### [229] [SING-SQL: A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for In-Domain Text-to-SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25672)
*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL automates the generation of high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any database schema using a two-stage pipeline, hierarchical schema partitioning, and a quality-aware validation/repair process, plus compact language models (SingSQL-LM) fine-tuned on the synthetic data; it enables strong in-domain generalization without relying on SQL logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In enterprise settings, Text-to-SQL systems must specialize to a single database schema and be evaluable on an organization's own databases. Existing work often relies on cross-domain generalization, synthetic data from varied schemas, or SQL logs; there is a gap for automated, schema-aware data generation that works for any target database without manual annotations.

Method: A two-stage data generation framework: (1) hierarchically partition the target database schema into sub-schemas and (2) synthesize SQL queries across multiple complexity levels. A quality-aware pipeline then validates using LLMs as judges, checks executability, automatically repairs issues, and balances column usage. The approach also releases SingSQL-LM—compact LMs fine-tuned on the synthetic data—and investigates context management strategies, finding schema-free fine-tuning with schema-only inference most robust.

Result: On the BIRD benchmark subset, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 attains 82.87% Soft F1 and 73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B baseline by +16.21 Soft F1 and +12.36 EX. At 1.5B scale, SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves by +9.30 Soft F1 and +4.49 EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs surpass prior systems by wide margins, attaining state-of-the-art results among open models at comparable scales.

Conclusion: SING-SQL provides a scalable, database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL systems, with robust performance driven by schema-aware data generation and a quality-aware validation/repair loop; schema-free fine-tuning with schema-only inference yields particularly robust results for enterprise deployments.

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

*Yixiao Chen,Yanyue Xie,Ruining Yang,Wei Jiang,Wei Wang,Yong He,Yue Chen,Pu Zhao,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative compression framework for ultra-large Mixture-of-Experts models (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) that jointly applies expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization to enable edge deployment under strict memory limits, achieving substantial storage reduction with preserved or improved accuracy compared to uniform quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-large MoEs with hundreds of billions of parameters face prohibitive memory/storage requirements, hindering deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning or quantization alone often degrades accuracy severely due to aggressive compression; a coordinated approach is needed.

Method: Proposes a joint compression framework combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. Demonstrates on DeepSeek-V3 that storage can be reduced from 1.3 TB to about 103 GB, enabling deployment within a 128 GB memory platform, with experiments across benchmarks under varying memory budgets.

Result: Substantial reduction in model storage (≈12x) with maintained or even improved output quality compared with traditional uniform low-bit quantization. The authors claim first deployment of a compressed ultra-large MoE (DeepSeek-V3) on a platform with a strict 128 GB limit.

Conclusion: Collaborative compression across pruning, quantization, and activation optimization can enable feasible edge deployment of ultra-large MoEs, outperforming standard uniform quantization in accuracy while dramatically reducing storage requirements.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

assistant for users to manage google calendar events in natural language. The
system uses a graph-structured coordination mechanism where a central
supervisory agent supervises specialized task agents, allowing modularity,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning framework with an expert system (HGNN-EM + DDQN) improves autonomous vehicle decision-making in heterogeneous traffic, demonstrated on a four-way intersection with superior safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence, while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating traffic with diverse driving styles and interactions is complex. A representation capturing heterogeneous vehicle features and guidance from domain knowledge is needed to enhance AV decision-making.

Method: Introduce a heterogeneous graph representation of traffic; develop HGNN-EM to encode varied vehicle features and produce driving instructions guided by an expert model; train the policy with Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN); validate via a case study at a four-way intersection with mixed driving styles.

Result: The proposed method outperforms several baselines in safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Conclusion: HGNN-EM with an expert system is effective for AV decision-making in heterogeneous traffic; shows promise for real-time, scalable deployment, though generalization to broader scenarios and deeper analysis of the expert integration are pertinent.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

*Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune is a training-free neuro-symbolic framework that translates natural language queries into executable Python programs, merging Vision-Language Model perception with soft-logic reasoning to enable compositional generalization under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models often struggle with compositional reasoning; neuro-symbolic approaches are limited by rigid predicates and predefined logic. A flexible, uncertainty-aware, training-free framework that decouples perception from reasoning could improve generalization to novel tasks.

Method: A hybrid execution model that dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs combining imperative control flow with soft logic operators. Perception is handled by foundation VMs, while reasoning uses differentiable, uncertainty-aware operations. The system is training-free but modular and differentiable for potential fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and adversarial tests, NePTune significantly outperforms strong base models and demonstrates robust compositional generalization and adaptation to novel environments.

Conclusion: NePTune validates a practical neuro-symbolic approach that decouples perception from reasoning, enables uncertainty-aware soft-logic reasoning, and offers a training-free deployment path with potential for fine-tuning via differentiable components.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: Post-training induces specialized, functionally specialized attention heads that enable structured reasoning; the emergence and dynamics of these heads depend on the training regime, with distillation/SFT adding stable heads and policy optimization driving a dynamic, reward-driven selection. There is a trade-off: stronger reasoning heads improve hard problems but can cause overthinking or errors on easy tasks.

Motivation: To uncover the circuit-level mechanisms by which post-training improves reasoning in large models, and to explain regime-dependent differences in emergent attention heads.

Method: Circuit analysis across Qwen families and a DeepSeek-distilled model; comparative analysis of emergent heads under distillation, supervised fine-tuning, and group relative policy optimization; ablation and qualitative analyses; evaluation of 'think on/off' models to identify dedicated thinking heads; track how head survival correlates with task reward signals.

Result: Emergent, functionally specialized attention heads arise during post-training that support structured reasoning. Distillation and SFT lead to a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads, while group relative policy optimization yields a dynamic set of heads activated/pruned in response to reward. Controllable think on/off models lack dedicated thinking heads; turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader but less efficient compensatory head set. Stronger heads enable advanced problem-solving but can induce over-thinking and errors on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: There is an inherent tension between developing powerful reasoning strategies and maintaining reliable, elementary computation. Training policy design should balance fostering effective reasoning with ensuring robust, error-free execution, guiding future work toward mechanisms that control when and how complex reasoning emerges.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

### [235] [Galton's Law of Mediocrity: Why Large Language Models Regress to the Mean and Fail at Creativity in Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25767)
*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs regress toward the mean in creative tasks: simplifying prompts erases creative features; regeneration yields longer but shallower outputs; ad-specific cues help but models still rely on familiar tropes; targeted guidance is needed to foster creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how large language models preserve or lose creativity under processing, and to identify signals that can steer models toward more originality in applied domains like advertising.

Method: Galton-style regression to the mean analysis of creativity in LLM outputs; a creativity stress test with advertising concepts; stepwise simplification of ideas; assessment of metaphors, emotions, visuals, and factual content; regeneration from simplified inputs; quantitative comparisons plus qualitative analysis; experimentation with ad-specific cues.

Result: Simplified inputs cause loss of creative features (metaphors, emotion, visual cues) while factual content remains; regenerated outputs show more lexical variety and length but lack depth, distinctiveness, and true originality; regenerated texts may seem novel but are not truly original; adding ad-specific cues improves alignment and stylistic balance but outputs still rely on familiar tropes.

Conclusion: Without targeted guidance, LLMs drift toward mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals can partially counter this tendency and point toward creating creativity-sensitive models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

### [236] [Planner-R1: Reward Shaping Enables Efficient Agentic RL with Smaller LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25779)
*Siyu Zhu,Yanbin Jiang,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Biao He,Rohit Jain,Zhipeng Wang,Alborz Geramifard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic RL on TravelPlanner with Planner-R1 attains 56.9% final-pass with only 180 training queries; reward shaping boosts 8B models to competitive levels, offering strong efficiency; larger models benefit from sparse rewards but show smaller gains from shaping and more variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess how model scale, reward shaping, and training regimes affect agentic RL performance and generalization, using a public benchmark and out-of-domain tests.

Method: Compare 8B vs 32B LLMs on TravelPlanner with Planner-R1; apply dense vs sparse rewards; evaluate curriculum learning; test on out-of-domain benchmarks Multi-IF, NaturalPlan, tau-Bench; measure compute/memory efficiency and final-pass rates.

Result: 8B models with dense rewards achieve competitive performance; 3.5x compute efficiency and 1.5x memory efficiency vs 32B; 56.9% final-pass; 2.7x improvement over GPT-5 baseline; larger models robust to sparse rewards but gains from shaping are smaller; curriculum learning offers no benefit; no evident overfitting; out-of-domain generalization preserved.

Conclusion: Reward shaping is a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL; smaller models offer strong efficiency with maintained generalization; shaping can unlock agentic RL performance without sacrificing out-of-domain capabilities.

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

### [237] [Deontic Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25781)
*Guido Governatori,Antonino Rotolo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A paper on deontic argumentation that supports weak permission. It shows grounded semantics fail to support weak permission under conflicting obligations, defines a Deontic Argumentation Theory (DAT) to accommodate weak permission, recalls grounded-semantics results, and introduces a new semantics that does support weak permission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable reliable reasoning about weak permission in deontic logic, especially in situations with conflicts between obligations where standard grounded semantics fall short.

Method: The method includes formalizing a Deontic Argumentation Theory to handle weak permission, analyzing existing grounded semantics and their limitations, and proposing a new semantics that preserves weak permission in conflict scenarios (likely with formal definitions, theorems, and examples).

Result: Grounded semantics do not support weak permission in the presence of conflicting obligations. The paper defines DAT to account for weak permission and then proposes a new semantics that successfully supports weak permission.

Conclusion: A new deontic-argumentation semantics is proposed that accommodates weak permission, addressing the limitations of grounded semantics and providing a more expressive framework for deontic reasoning with weak permissions.

Abstract: We address the issue of defining a semantics for deontic argumentation that
supports weak permission. Some recent results show that grounded semantics do
not support weak permission when there is a conflict between two obligations.
We provide a definition of Deontic Argumentation Theory that accounts for weak
permission, and we recall the result about grounded semantics. Then, we propose
a new semantics that supports weak permission.

### [238] [PUREVQ-GAN: Defending Data Poisoning Attacks through Vector-Quantized Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25792)
*Alexander Branch,Omead Pooladzandi,Radin Khosraviani,Sunay Gajanan Bhat,Jeffrey Jiang,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN uses a vector-quantized bottleneck with a GAN discriminator to defend CIFAR-10 against data-poisoning backdoors by destroying fine-grained triggers while preserving semantics; it achieves 0% PSR against Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope, 1.64% against Narcissus, maintains 91-95% clean accuracy, and runs >50x faster than diffusion-based defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor and data-poisoning attacks threaten reliable machine learning by embedding triggers in training data. Many defenses either degrade clean accuracy, are computationally heavy (e.g., diffusion-based methods), or fail against adaptive attacks. A fast, accurate method that neutralizes triggers while preserving semantic content is urgently needed for practical training pipelines.

Method: The method uses PureVQ-GAN, a vector-quantized VAE with a GAN discriminator. Poisoned images are passed through a learned codebook to a discrete bottleneck, quantizing content and destroying fine-grained backdoor triggers. The GAN discriminator enforces outputs to lie on the natural image distribution, preventing reconstruction of perturbations that diverge from natural imagery.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-10 show 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, 1.64% PSR against Narcissus, and clean accuracy in the 91–95% range. The method is reported to be over 50x faster than diffusion-based defenses.

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN provides a practical, fast defense against data-poisoning backdoors, balancing strong attack resilience with high clean accuracy. It is well-suited for real training pipelines and offers substantial speed advantages over diffusion-based approaches, though further validation on more datasets and against adaptive attacks would strengthen its generalizability.

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [239] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CiT plugs adaptive branching into tree-search LLM reasoning to save compute with little/positive effect on accuracy. BN-DP reduces compute dramatically; BN-SC saves but can be unstable; relies on high-quality auxiliary LLMs; guaranteed no increase in LLM invocations; unified open-source implementation across three frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning with LLMs at test time is bottlenecked by expensive, exhaustive tree search. Existing methods (ToT, MCTS, RAP) are accurate but inefficient. There is a need for adaptive, lightweight branching decisions to cut compute while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that decides when to branch during search via Branching Necessity evaluations: BN-DP (Direct Prompting) uses an auxiliary LLM to judge branching necessity, BN-SC (Self-Consistency) clusters candidate actions to estimate agreement. Integrate CiT into ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate on GSM8K and Math500. Provide theoretical guarantee (BN-DP does not increase invocations) and release unified implementation.

Result: BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85% across settings, with negligible accuracy loss and occasional gains. BN-SC yields up to ~80% savings but shows instability in 1-4 of 14 settings due to very long reasoning steps in some examples. The performance heavily depends on the quality of auxiliary LLMs; smaller LLMs degrade BN-SC and BN-DP evaluation. BN-SC can be avoided in domains with deterministic action spaces where clustering can be done programmatically. The authors provide a theoretical guarantee regarding BN-DP invocations and release unified CiT across the three frameworks.

Conclusion: Adaptive branching with CiT yields substantial efficiency gains for long-horizon LLM reasoning. BN-DP offers robust, large compute savings with guaranteed non-increase in LLM calls, while BN-SC can offer additional savings at the risk of instability. Overall, CiT enables scalable, reproducible integration across multiple tree-search frameworks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

### [240] [HiStyle: Hierarchical Style Embedding Predictor for Text-Prompt-Guided Controllable Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25842)
*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiStyle introduces a two-stage, hierarchical style-embedding predictor for controllable TTS, using t-SNE to reveal hierarchical clustering of embeddings and employing contrastive learning to align text and audio spaces; plus a style-annotation strategy blending statistics and human preference. Result: improved controllability with preserved naturalness/intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly predicting a global style embedding from prompts ignores the underlying distribution of style embeddings, which exhibit hierarchical structure. Exploiting this distribution can improve controllability and prompt alignment in controllable TTS.

Method: A two-stage style embedding predictor (HiStyle) conditioned on textual prompts that first predicts coarse style embeddings at a higher level and then finer style details; incorporates contrastive learning to align text and audio embedding spaces. A style annotation strategy combines statistical methods and human auditory preferences to craft more accurate prompts for style control.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows HiStyle offers significantly better style controllability than alternative embedding-prediction approaches while maintaining high speech naturalness and intelligibility.

Conclusion: Leveraging the hierarchical distribution of style embeddings and aligning text-audio spaces with contrastive learning yields improved controllable TTS performance without sacrificing voice quality; style prompts can be further improved via a hybrid statistical-human annotation approach.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

### [241] [ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25843)
*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard surgically identifies and scales the activation of tense-vulnerable heads and uses preventative fine-tuning to reduce tense jailbreaking without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite safety alignment, LLMs exhibit brittle refusals that can be evaded by simple linguistic shifts (e.g., changing tense), exposing a generalization gap in current alignment approaches. Understanding the mechanistic causes of such failures is needed to design targeted, efficient defenses that preserve utility.

Method: 1) Use circuit analysis to identify attention heads causally linked to the tense-changing jailbreaking attack. 2) Train a precise, channel-wise activation-scaling vector to recalibrate these targeted heads. 3) Apply a preventative fine-tuning regime to teach a more robust refusal mechanism, then evaluate across models.

Result: Across three LLMs, ASGuard reduces the attack success rate of the targeted jailbreaking, while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over-refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and utility.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that mechanistic analysis of model internals can guide practical, efficient defenses against adversarial behavior. By dampening the refusal-mediating directions targeted by suffix-based attacks, ASGuard offers a reproducible path toward more reliable and interpretable AI safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify how aging impacts performance and develop robust, generalizable models to classify career trajectories and forecast performance in sports analytics.

Method: Autoencoder with K-means clustering to classify career trends; LSTM to predict each player's performance; dataset from veteran NBA game data.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines and demonstrates generalization across different career-trend types.

learning method was adopted in performance prediction of each NBA player. The
dataset was collected from the basketball game data of veteran NBA players. The
contribution of the work performed better than the other methods with
generalization ability for evaluating various types of NBA career trend, and
can be applied in different types of sports in the field of sport analytics.

*Olga Krestinskaya,Mohammed E. Fouda,Ahmed Eltawil,Khaled N. Salama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hardware-aware NAS framework (CIMNAS) jointly optimizes software, quantization, and hardware parameters for CIM-based neural accelerators, achieving massive energy-delayed-area product (EDAP) and efficiency gains with no accuracy loss, demonstrated on MobileNet/RRAM CIM (and SRAM ResNet50) with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of CIM accelerator design is impractical due to the enormous, interdependent parameter space; hardware-aware optimization is needed to maximize energy efficiency and accuracy.

Method: CIMNAS performs a joint search across software (model/quantization) parameters and hardware parameters, enabling device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations for CIM architectures; extended to SRAM-based models (ResNet50) and validated on ImageNet.

Result: Explores a vast search space (9.9×10^85 combos); achieves EDAP reductions from 90.1× to 104.5×, TOPS/W improvements from 4.68× to 4.82×, and TOPS/mm^2 gains from 11.3× to 12.78×, while maintaining 73.81% accuracy; demonstrates adaptability with SRAM-based ResNet50 yielding up to 819.5× EDAP reduction; source code available.

Conclusion: CIMNAS enables EDAP-focused optimization without accuracy loss and generates diverse software-hardware configurations for high-performance CIM accelerators, showing robustness across architectures; openness via the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

### [244] [Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873)
*Hankun Dai,Maoquan Wang,Mengnan Qi,Yikai Zhang,Zijian Jin,Yongqiang Yao,Yufan Huang,Shengyu Fu,Elsie Nallipogu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita is a lightweight autonomous-agent framework that minimizes manual scaffolding while preserving core capabilities; it matches or surpasses more complex, workflow-based agents while using fewer tokens and design efforts, and hints that agent complexity benefits shrink as model quality improves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agents rely on heavy, hand-crafted workflows, prompting tricks, and extensive scaffolding, which inflates design effort, risks data leakage, and obscures the model’s true abilities. A lightweight, unified evaluation framework is needed to faithfully reveal coding competence.

Method: Introduce Lita (Lite Agent) under the principle of liteness, and evaluate it on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench benchmarks using frontier models. Compare against workflow-based and agentic baselines in terms of performance, token usage, and design effort. Propose the Agent Complexity Law to formalize the observed trend.

Result: Lita achieves competitive or superior performance relative to more complex baselines, while consuming fewer tokens and requiring significantly less design effort. This supports the claim that Lita can reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs without elaborate scaffolding.

Conclusion: Lita demonstrates that minimal, well-founded agent design can match or exceed richer pipelines, enabling more faithful assessment of coding ability. The Agent Complexity Law further predicts that as core models improve, the performance gap across agent complexities will narrow to negligible levels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

*Ruolin Chen,Yinqian Sun,Jihang Wang,Mingyang Lv,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A four-stage safety risk framework for embodied LLMs, a multimodal benchmark (SafeMindBench) with 5,558 samples across four task categories, and a modular SafeMindAgent (Planner-Executor with cascaded safety modules) that improves safety without sacrificing task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied LLMs interacting with the physical world face safety vulnerabilities. There is a need to systematically characterize, evaluate, and mitigate safety risks across sensing, planning, and acting.

Method: Formalize four reasoning stages (Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, Low-Level Action Generation) and three orthogonal safety constraints (Factual, Causal, Temporal). Build SafeMindBench with 5,558 multimodal samples across four tasks (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align); evaluate leading LLMs and embodied agents; propose SafeMindAgent, a Planner-Executor architecture with three cascaded safety modules that integrate safety constraints into reasoning.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and common embodied agents remain vulnerable to safety-critical failures; SafeMindAgent substantially improves safety rate vs strong baselines while preserving task performance.

Conclusion: SafeMindBench provides a rigorous evaluation suite, and SafeMindAgent offers a practical approach to mitigating safety risks in embodied LLM agents, enabling systematic study and safer deployment.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation

### [246] [DeepJSONEval: Benchmarking Complex Nested JSON Data Mining for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25922)
*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepJSONEval introduces a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract data into deep, nested JSON for web mining, revealing gaps and guiding improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current JSON-output benchmarks focus on pure generation, not data comprehension/extraction. Web data mining benefits from accurate, hierarchical JSON representations, but existing benchmarks poorly reflect real tasks with nested structures.

Method: Developed DeepJSONEval with 2100 multi-domain instances featuring deep nesting. Instances are categorized by difficulty. LLMs are evaluated on their ability to extract structured information into complex JSON schemas. The dataset and benchmark are open-sourced.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs as nesting depth and complexity increase, indicating current models struggle with deep hierarchical extraction.

Conclusion: The benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to advance research in structured JSON generation and practical web data mining.

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In life-threatening rescue operations, rapid, informed decisions are critical; vital signs offer actionable information to support clinicians and rescuers; there is a need for integrated, wearable-enabled decision support to reduce response times and improve patient outcomes.

Method: The paper describes the KIRETT concept and its integration of vital signs into a wearable platform to deliver treatment recommendations and situation detection; discusses the system architecture and potential workflow for rescue operations; no empirical evaluation is reported in the abstract.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework and potential impact rather than experimental results; the main contribution is highlighting the role and impact of vital-sign integration in decision-making for rescuers.

Conclusion: Vital-sign integration via wearable technology like KIRETT has the potential to enhance decision-making, operational efficiency, and patient care in rescue operations.

Abstract: The integration of vital signs in healthcare has witnessed a steady rise,
promising health professionals to assist in their daily tasks to improve
patient treatment. In life-threatening situations, like rescue operations,
crucial decisions need to be made in the shortest possible amount of time to
ensure that excellent treatment is provided during life-saving measurements.
The integration of vital signs in the treatment holds the potential to improve
time utilization for rescuers in such critical situations. They furthermore
serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful
information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves
to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a
wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the
significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during

TL;DR: A wearable device (KIRETT) supports rescue services with real-time patient data and treatment recommendations; a two-day evaluation (14 participants) analyzes rescue operators' healthcare needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve rapid, accurate, patient-driven care in time-critical emergencies by augmenting human decision-making with wearable sensors, AI-driven analysis, and real-time vitals monitoring.

Method: Quantitative two-day field evaluation of KIRETT with 14 participants focusing on rescue operators' healthcare needs; assessment of usefulness and feasibility of treatment recommendations and real-time monitoring.

Result: The paper reports quantitative results from the evaluation, outlining identified needs and indications of the device's potential to support fast, data-driven treatment decisions in rescue scenarios.

Conclusion: KIRETT shows promise in enhancing emergency medical response by providing data-driven support; the study supplies initial quantitative insights into operators' needs and technology viability in rescue services.

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

### [249] [Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25941)
*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Estimating problem solvability and conditioning training on it improves chain-of-thought reliability in MCQA, reducing spurious CoTs and boosting process-correct reasoning and accuracy in math/multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curb spurious reasoning and hallucinations in large language models by understanding how question solvability affects the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, using MCQA as a controlled setting.

Method: 1) Estimate per-question solvability. 2) Adapt outcome-supervised reward models and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into objectives. 3) Evaluate on math and multimodal MCQA tasks.

Result: Across domains, solvability-aware objectives yield higher rates of process-correct reasoning; in RL, improved answer accuracy; reduced hallucinations and more reliable CoT reasoning.

Conclusion: Solvability is a key factor in reliable CoT reasoning; integrating solvability into training objectives improves reasoning quality and robustness across tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

### [250] [NuRisk: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Agent-Level Risk Assessment in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25944)
*Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Roberto Brusnicki,Yuchen Zhang,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuRisk introduces a large spatio-temporal VQA benchmark for autonomous driving risk assessment, showing current Vision-Language Models struggle with temporal reasoning; a fine-tuned 7B model improves accuracy to 41% and lowers latency, yet task remains challenging, establishing NuRisk as a key benchmark for spatio-temporal reasoning in driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where existing VLMs work on static images and qualitative judgments, lacking explicit spatio-temporal reasoning about how risk evolves over time in driving scenarios; require agent-level, temporal risk annotations in BEV sequences.

Method: Construct NuRisk from real-world nuScenes/Waymo data plus CommonRoad simulations, providing Bird-Eye-View sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk labels; benchmark standard VLMs with varying prompts; fine-tune a 7B VLM agent for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and measure improvements in accuracy and latency.

Result: Baseline VLMs fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, achieving up to 33% accuracy at high latency. A fine-tuned 7B VLM agent reaches 41% accuracy and cuts latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities not present in proprietary models.

Conclusion: NuRisk is a challenging but crucial benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving. While progress is shown, the accuracy is still modest, highlighting substantial room for improvement.

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

### [251] [Automated Model Discovery via Multi-modal & Multi-step Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25946)
*Lee Jung-Mok,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Moon Ye-Bin,Junhyun Nam,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal, multi-step pipeline for automated model discovery using two vision-language modules (AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM) to propose and evaluate candidate models, achieving a balance between fine-grained detail and generalizability; ablation studies show the importance of multi-modality and multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated model discovery often struggles to simultaneously capture fine-grained details and ensure generalizability with reasonable model complexity. The work aims to create an autonomous, planning-based approach that can propose high-quality models and robustly evaluate them.

Method: Introduce two vision-language-based modules: AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to propose candidate models; EvaluatorVLM assesses candidates both quantitatively and perceptually for local detail fidelity and global generalization. The pipeline is evaluated via ablations to quantify the roles of multi-modality and multi-step reasoning.

Result: The pipeline effectively discovers models that balance capturing fine details with maintaining generalizability. Ablation studies indicate that both the multi-modal integration and the multi-step reasoning are crucial for discovering favorable models.

Conclusion: A multi-modal, multi-step reasoning framework enhances automated model discovery, enabling robust identification of models that fit local details while generalizing to broader trends; the approach is supported by ablation evidence and has potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

### [252] [RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25958)
*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoRecomp is a plug-and-play data recomposition technique for RL-enabled reasoning that uses two batch types to steer models toward concise reasoning, improving efficiency with minimal performance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR often yields verbose reasoning and inefficient exploration due to outcome-only rewards, high variance in response length, and unstable training signals; a method to promote brevity while preserving performance is needed.

Method: RoRecomp partitions training data into two batch types: (1) priority batches that mix short-correct and long-incorrect responses from online batches to provide a clear gradient toward brevity; (2) compensation batches that use the remaining responses from a replay buffer to stabilize training and prevent model collapse.

Result: Across three settings RoRecomp achieves notable efficiency gains: 27.7% shorter reasoning without RL training, 46.8% fewer unnecessary tool calls with improved accuracy in agentic RL, and up to 52.5% shorter thinking in thinking compression, with minimal impact on performance.

Conclusion: RoRecomp demonstrates that intelligent data recomposition can steer RLVR toward concise, efficient reasoning while maintaining stability and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

*Junbeom Kim,Kyuyoung Kim,Jihoon Tack,Dongha Lim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CURE is a retrieval-augmented corrective unlearning framework that detects and rewrites leaked information in model outputs by applying a lightweight corrector with in-context retrieved targets, enabling scalable continual unlearning while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models trained on web-scale data risk memorizing sensitive information; traditional input-output suppression methods fail to eliminate underlying knowledge and scale poorly; there's a need for a scalable, end-to-end unlearning mechanism.

Method: Apply a lightweight corrector to the base model to verify and rewrite outputs that contain target knowledge. Use retrieval to fetch relevant unlearning targets as in-context references to guide detection and revision. This allows unlearning requests to be handled without additional training and supports continual unlearning.

Result: Empirical evaluations show reduced information leakage, including leakage from indirect queries, while maintaining response quality. CURE is robust under continual unlearning and practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: CURE provides a scalable, retrieval-augmented unlearning framework that revises outputs to suppress leakage and adapts to new unlearning requests without retraining, addressing both direct and indirect memorized knowledge.

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

### [254] [Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991)
*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes OmniFake dataset and UMFDet for unified multimodal fake content detection across human misinformation and AI-generated content; introduces a VLM-based model with a category-aware MoE adapter and an attribution chain-of-thought module; shows robust, cross-type performance outperforming specialized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world social media, fake content comes from both human misinformation and AI-generated artifacts, but current research treats them separately. A unified benchmark and detector are needed for practical safeguards.

Method: Construct OmniFake (127K samples) combining curated misinformation with AI-generated examples. Develop UMFDet: a Vision-Language Model backbone augmented by a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adapter to capture category-specific cues, plus an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism to guide saliency localization of deceptive signals.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate robust and consistent performance across both deception types and superiority over specialized baselines, indicating the method's practicality for real-world multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: OmniFake and UMFDet offer a unified, scalable solution for multimodal deception detection and provide a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage NAS framework (CoLLM-NAS) uses two complementary LLMs—a Navigator and a Generator—with a Coordinator to guide neural-architecture search, achieving state-of-the-art NAS results and improving existing two-stage NAS methods across multiple search spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and subpar performance of existing NAS approaches, by leveraging structured knowledge and iterative feedback from LLMs to guide and synthesize high-quality architectures.

Method: Introduce a two-LMM collaboration: a Navigator LLM to steer search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize candidate architectures, orchestrated by a Coordinator. The method integrates LLM knowledge with progressive feedback and historical trajectories to efficiently navigate NAS spaces across two-stage frameworks.

Result: CoLLM-NAS achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201, surpassing traditional NAS methods and search algorithms. It also consistently enhances two-stage NAS methods (OFA, SPOS, AutoFormer) across diverse search spaces (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, AutoFormer).

Conclusion: Collaborative, knowledge-guided LLMs can substantially improve NAS efficiency and performance, offering strong generalization to different search spaces and two-stage NAS pipelines.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

### [256] [Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models as Synthetic Social Agents in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26080)
*Emma Rose Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs should be treated as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation, not as sources of probabilistic inference; use guardrails to avoid misinterpretation and category errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used as synthetic agents in social science, outputs can be mistaken for posterior evidence from a coherent model. A cautious reframing is needed to prevent misinterpretation and misapplication.

Method: Advocates a pragmatic reframing of LLMs as pattern matchers with explicit scope conditions and proposes practical guardrails: independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration, enabling useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Result: A set of practical recommendations and guardrails for using LLMs in social science, including independent draws, preregistered baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration, framed within a non-probabilistic interpretation of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs can aid prototyping and forecasting under explicit scope and guardrails, but should not substitute probabilistic inference; careful interpretation and validation are essential to avoid misinterpretation of outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

*Yixu Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xinyuan Li,Yan Teng,Xingjun Ma,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SafeEvalAgent, a dynamic, self-evolving multi-agent framework for agentic safety evaluation that continuously ingests policy documents to generate and refine safety benchmarks; demonstrates that static benchmarks miss deep vulnerabilities, with GPT-5's EU AI Act compliance dropping from 72.50% to 36.36% across iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static evaluation benchmarks fail to capture evolving AI risks and regulatory landscapes in high-stakes AI deployment, creating safety gaps that static tests cannot close.

Method: Introduce SafeEvalAgent: a multi-agent pipeline that ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and evolve safety tests; implements a Self-evolving Evaluation loop where evaluation results guide the creation of increasingly sophisticated test cases; empirical evaluation showing safety degradation as tests harden.

Result: Safety rate declines as evaluation hardens; concrete example: GPT-5's EU AI Act compliance drops from 72.50% to 36.36% across iterations, indicating deeper vulnerabilities uncovered by dynamic evaluation.

Conclusion: Static benchmarks are insufficient for AI safety; dynamic, self-evolving evaluation ecosystems are necessary to robustly assess and ensure safe deployment of advanced LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

TL;DR: A hackable end-to-end pipeline to build knowledge graphs from unstructured online content (drug leaflets) using a web scraper and LLM, and MEDAKA, a curated dataset of drug-leaflet attributes; evaluated via manual checks and an LLM-as-a-Judge; demonstrates expanded coverage over existing biomedical KGs; code and data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical KGs often miss rich contextual data found in drug leaflets; need scalable methods to extract structured knowledge from unstructured sources; MEDAKA enables patient safety tasks and drug recommendations.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline combining web scraping and LLM-driven extraction to convert unstructured leaflets into KGs; generated MEDAKA by applying the method to publicly available drug leaflets; curation to capture side effects, warnings, contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage, physical characteristics.

Result: Manual inspection and an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation; coverage comparison against existing KGs and databases; findings indicate MEDAKA provides broader, clinically relevant attribute coverage and demonstrates feasibility for KG construction from unstructured sources.

Conclusion: MEDAKA and the accompanying pipeline enable scalable KG construction from unstructured biomedical text; supports tasks like patient safety monitoring and drug recommendation; the approach is generalizable to other domains.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: LMILAtt combines LSTM autoencoders and attention to detect depression from social media by capturing temporal dynamics and weighting early depression signals, achieving higher accuracy with weak supervision to reduce labeling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a major global health issue; early detection via social media is promising, yet current approaches suffer from limited accuracy, underutilized time-series features, and high annotation costs.

Method: Unsupervised LSTM autoencoders extract temporal dynamics of tweets; attention mechanism dynamically weights key texts (e.g., early signals); a multi-example learning architecture enables user-level detection; weakly supervised learning reduces labeling cost; evaluated on the WU3D dataset labeled by professionals.

Result: The LMILAtt model outperforms baselines in accuracy, recall, and F1; weak supervision significantly lowers labeling costs and offers an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening.

Conclusion: LMILAtt demonstrates improved performance and cost efficiency for depression screening on social media by coupling temporal dynamics encoding with attention-driven emphasis on critical signals, suitable for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

TL;DR: A field manual for deploying generative AI in healthcare emphasizes implementing infrastructure over model tinkering, drawing lessons from deploying an irAE detection agent and interviews with 20 clinicians/engineers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Close the gap between the potential of LLM-enabled clinical workflows and real-world deployment by providing practitioner-oriented guidance grounded in deployment experience.

Method: Empirical synthesis from deploying the irAE-Agent at Mass General Brigham and structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders; analysis of time allocation reveals most effort goes to sociotechnical implementation.

Result: Identifies a misalignment: <20% of effort on prompt engineering/model development vs. >80% on implementation work; distills five heavy lifts needed for scalable deployment: data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing system drift, governance.

Conclusion: To translate generative AI from pilots to routine clinical care, focus on infrastructure, governance, and ongoing deployment work; the field manual provides actionable guidance to bridge the valley of death.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

*Runxin Yang,Yuxuan Wan,Shuqing Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniGen is an end-to-end, zero-coding pipeline that converts natural language requirements into runnable 3D games via a coordinated multi-agent system (Planning, Generation, Automation, Debugging), achieving executable projects with dramatically reduced development time (91.4%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in automated 3D game development: existing ML approaches are limited to 2D or code snippets, require manual engine integration, and struggle with interactive logic/state management; there is a need to translate multimodal LLM outputs into production-ready game projects.

Method: A four-agent architecture: Planning Agent converts user requirements into blueprints and logic descriptions; Generation Agent writes executable C# scripts; Automation Agent binds components to the engine and constructs scenes; Debugging Agent performs real-time error correction via conversational interaction; evaluation on three prototypes; open-source release.

Result: Demonstrates end-to-end zero-coding game development; 3 prototype evaluations; 91.4% reduction in development time; released on GitHub; video demonstration available.

Conclusion: UniGen shows feasibility of automated end-to-end 3D game generation from natural language; it lowers the barrier to game creation and accelerates development; future work could extend engine support, improve robustness, and enhance debugging and testing workflows.

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

### [262] ['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167)
*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shift AI cultural alignment from quantitative benchmarks to qualitative, ethnographic approaches to produce 'thick outputs' grounded in user context; outlines three conditions and calls for cross-disciplinary evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment practices oversimplify culture and miss deeper meanings; interpretive social science methods are needed to ensure culturally sensitive and ethically responsible AI.

Method: Introduce a 'thick description' inspired framework; define 'thick outputs' and three necessary conditions: scoped cultural representations, capacity for nuanced outputs, anchoring outputs in prompts’ cultural contexts; advocate qualitative ethnographic evaluation and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Result: Conceptual framework and evaluation guidance for cultural alignment in LLMs; no empirical results yet; sets directions for future research.

Conclusion: Advocates qualitative, ethnographic evaluation and collaboration to develop AI that reflects human cultural complexity and ethical responsibility.

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

### [263] [LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201)
*Andreas Werbrouck,Marshall B. Lindsay,Matthew Maschmann,Matthias J. Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are used as autonomous knowledge-discovery agents that interrogate a black-box system to generate generalizable statements, demonstrated via a children's parlor game and an atomic layer processing (ALD) reactor simulation with limited probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work explores using large language models as independent reasoning agents for knowledge discovery in materials science, aiming to generate verifiable, generalizable insights from a black-box system rather than optimize a predefined task.

Method: Repurpose LangGraph tool functionality to provide agents with a black-box interrogable function; implement a knowledge-discovery loop that emphasizes trial-and-error and persistence; validate with a toy children's parlor game demonstration; apply the same strategy to an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Result: The experiments show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in the simulation; results highlight the importance of trial-and-error, persistence, and strong path-dependence in knowledge discovery.

Conclusion: Autonomous LLM-based agents can enable knowledge discovery in complex materials systems, producing generalizable statements from black-box interrogations; success depends on probe design and execution strategy, with path-dependence and persistence as key factors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

### [264] [Human-Centered Evaluation of RAG outputs: a framework and questionnaire for human-AI collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26205)
*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-centered evaluation framework for RAG outputs using a 12-dimension questionnaire, iteratively refined with human and human-LLM feedback; LLMs excel at metric language but miss format variations; humans struggle with metric-only focus; the final instrument emphasizes user intent, text structuring, and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic, human-centered evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) outputs is underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, the work aims to create a reliable, human-centered evaluation questionnaire to assess RAG outputs across multiple dimensions.

Method: Design a questionnaire based on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework covering 12 dimensions. Iteratively refine through ratings on query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Incorporate feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair.

Result: LLMs reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels but struggle to detect textual format variations. Humans struggle to focus strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations are helpful but numeric LLM and human ratings lack agreement. The final questionnaire extends the framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability.

Conclusion: The enhanced questionnaire provides a more user-centric evaluation of RAG outputs by prioritizing intent, structure, and verifiability, while also highlighting that human judgment remains essential and that LLMs can support evaluation but not fully replace human assessment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DIVER leverages global sequence-level diversity as an intrinsic reward to drive deep exploration in reinforcement-learning for reasoning in LLMs, yielding superior Pass@1/Pass@k and better out-of-domain performance, aided by potential-based shaping and anti-hacking heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of vast state-action spaces and sparse rewards in reasoning tasks; existing RLVR methods often suffer from deficient exploration and poor sample efficiency. The authors hypothesize that global diversity correlates with reasoning capacity and can be used as an intrinsic incentive.

Method: Propose DIVER (Diversity-Incentivized Exploration for Versatile Reasoning). Introduce a global diversity incentive in a semantically structured space as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration. Combine this with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance and simple heuristics to mitigate reward hacking.

Result: Empirical results show DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines across various exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, achieving strong performance in Pass@1 and Pass@k. Code is available at the provided GitHub repo.

Conclusion: Global diversity incentives effectively promote deep exploration for versatile reasoning, improving sample efficiency and generalization in RL-based reasoning for LLMs. DIVER demonstrates robust performance and provides a practical approach for enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize CPU-based deep learning inference for energy-constrained embedded deployments by understanding how convolution algorithms perform across modern CPUs.

Method: Benchmark direct, GEMM-based, and Winograd convolutions on CPUs from ARM, Intel, AMD, Apple, and NVIDIA, measuring latency and energy efficiency.

Result: Identified architectural factors that govern CPU convolution efficiency; NVIDIA AGX Orin with the GEMM algorithm provides the best latency-energy trade-off among the tested platforms.

Conclusion: Provide practical guidance for energy-aware CPU-based DL deployment and highlight how CPU architecture influences convolution performance.

Abstract: This work evaluates state-of-the-art convolution algorithms for CPU-based

### [267] [SlimPack: Fine-Grained Asymmetric Packing for Balanced and Efficient Variable-Length LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26246)
*Yuliang Liu,Guohao Wu,Shenglong Zhang,Wei Zhang,Qianchao Zhu,Zhouyang Li,Chenyu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack decomposes samples into fine-grained slices and applies asymmetric partitioning to balance forward and backward workloads, addressing context-length variance and data heterogeneity to improve throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient distributed LLM training is hindered by extreme variance in context lengths and data heterogeneity, which cause cascading workload imbalances, memory and communication bottlenecks, and underutilization; existing solutions trade efficiency for balance.

Method: Slice-level data decomposition combined with asymmetric partitioning to form balanced scheduling units, guided by a two-phase solver and a high-fidelity simulator to coordinate packing and scheduling across parallel dimensions.

Result: Demonstrates up to 2.8x training throughput improvement over baselines, with better load balance and resource efficiency across experiments.

Conclusion: SlimPack rethinks data packing and scheduling to resolve cross-dimension imbalances, delivering efficient, scalable LLM training by transforming large workloads into a stream of manageable units.

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

*Yichao Liang,Dat Nguyen,Cambridge Yang,Tianyang Li,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Carl Edward Rasmussen,Adrian Weller,Zenna Tavares,Tom Silver,Kevin Ellis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Joint learning of symbolic world models and causal dynamics for both endogenous actions and exogenous processes, enabling fast planning and generalization in long-horizon tasks with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon planning is challenging because exogenous processes unfold concurrently with the agent's actions; need models that jointly capture endogenous action effects and external dynamics.

Method: Learn symbolic state representations and causal-process models where each process captures the time course of a stochastic causal-effect relation; use variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals to learn from limited data.

Result: In five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning and generalization to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Proposes a general framework for abstract world models that capture both endogenous and exogenous dynamics and enable robust planning with limited data.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILR is a co-learning multi-agent framework with Dynamic Interaction and Idea3, plus Perception Calibration via GRPO, that improves independent problem-solving in LLMs beyond single-agent baselines, achieving up to 5% gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where existing MAS require re-execution during inference and to investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance individual reasoning, inspired by human collaborative cognition.

Method: Dynamic Interaction adaptively selects cooperative or competitive stances based on question difficulty and model ability. Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, Idea Fusion) enables structured inter-agent discussion. Perception Calibration uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to couple reward signals across agents, enhancing interaction cohesion.

Result: Evaluated on three LLMs across two model families (varying scales) using five math benchmarks and one coding benchmark. ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, with gains up to 5% over the strongest baseline. Idea3 improves robustness for stronger LLMs, and dynamic interaction types outperform pure cooperative or competitive strategies in MAS learning.

Conclusion: ILR demonstrates that coordinated co-learning with adaptive interaction and perception calibration can boost independent problem-solving in LLMs, with robust gains across tasks and model scales, and offers insights into more human-like collaborative reasoning.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

*Berdymyrat Ovezmyradov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reproducible, open-access management simulator benchmark for LLMs to evaluate long-horizon strategic business decision-making, comparing five LLMs on a simulated retail firm via month-by-month decisions and multi-metric KPIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in evaluating LLMs on long-term, strategic decision-making and coherence. Current benchmarks focus on short-horizon tasks; a reproducible, open benchmark is needed to assess long-horizon performance and decision rationale in business contexts.

Method: A dynamic 12-month retail management simulation with a spreadsheet-like experimental environment. In each of 12 months, LLMs receive a structured prompt containing the prior period’s business report and decide on pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring/dismissal, loans, training, R&D, and forecasts. The study compares five LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, Grok) via quantitative metrics (profit, revenue, market share, other KPIs) and qualitative assessment of strategic coherence, adaptability, and rationale.

Result: The paper proposes and demonstrates a framework for long-horizon benchmarking, applying it to five LLMs. It outlines how to measure long-term performance beyond short-term benchmarks and emphasizes reproducibility and the use of multiple metrics, including both quantitative results and the quality of decision rationales; no specific numeric results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work provides a reusable, open-access benchmark framework for evaluating LLMs on long-horizon strategic decision-making in business, enabling standardized, transparent assessment of long-term capabilities and fostering deeper understanding of LLMs’ performance in management contexts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SafeBehavior, a hierarchical jailbreak defense for LLMs that mimics human multi-stage reasoning (intention inference, self introspection, self revision) to detect and mitigate jailbreaks. Demonstrates improved robustness and efficiency against diverse attack types compared with seven baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak defenses suffer from high computation, limited generalization, and rigid workflows that miss subtle malicious intent. A human-inspired, adaptive defense could offer better detection and efficiency.

Method: SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: (1) intention inference to flag obvious input risks, (2) self introspection to assess generated outputs and assign confidence, and (3) self revision to rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. The system is evaluated against five jailbreak attack types (including optimization-based, contextual manipulation, and prompt-based attacks) and compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: Experimental results show that SafeBehavior improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, achieving safer outputs with potentially lower computational costs and greater flexibility than baseline defenses.

Conclusion: SafeBehavior provides a scalable, human-inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs from jailbreak attempts, with potential for broader applicability to diverse safety challenges in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Real-world video–derived time-series benchmarks reveal TSFMs struggle to generalize beyond synthetic benchmarks; introduces REAL-V-TSFM to bridge realism; data-centric benchmarking needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of time-series foundation models rely heavily on synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization underexplored. There is a need to bridge synthetic and realistic data and to assess whether TSFMs truly generalize to everyday temporal dynamics.

Method: Extract temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow, curate datasets that reflect everyday temporal dynamics, and build REAL-V-TSFM as a dataset of real-world time-series. Evaluate three state-of-the-art TSFMs in zero-shot forecasting on this dataset.

Result: Three SOTA TSFMs perform well on conventional benchmarks but show degradation on the REAL-V-TSFM dataset, indicating limited real-world generalization and universality.

Conclusion: Data-centric benchmarking and diverse model architectures are needed to advance TSFMs toward true universality, and the video-based time-series extraction pipeline is effective for creating realistic benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

### [273] [Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26354)
*Shuai Shao,Qihan Ren,Chen Qian,Boyi Wei,Dadi Guo,Jingyi Yang,Xinhao Song,Linfeng Zhang,Weinan Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Misevolution is a widespread risk in self-evolving agents, observed across four evolutionary pathways (model, memory, tool, workflow) and even with strong LLMs, threatening safety and reliability; the work provides empirical evidence, discussion of mitigation strategies, and calls for new safety paradigms, with code and data available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based self-evolving agents become more capable, there is a crucial risk that their autonomous evolution deviates in unintended ways, undermining safety and trust. This risk—misevolution—has been underexplored in safety research, motivating a systematic conceptualization and empirical study across key evolutionary pathways.

Method: Empirical evaluation of misevolution across four pathways—model, memory, tool, and workflow—using agents built on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). The study analyzes how memory accumulation can degrade safety alignment and how tool creation and reuse can introduce vulnerabilities, providing evidence and discussion, and sharing code/data.

Result: Misevolution is a widespread risk manifesting in self-evolving agents across multiple pathways. Emergent risks include degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation and vulnerabilities introduced during tool creation/reuse, observed even with advanced LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for new safety paradigms and mitigation strategies for self-evolving agents. The work outlines potential approaches and calls for further research to build safer, more trustworthy self-evolving systems, with code and data made available. Warning: examples may be offensive or harmful.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

### [274] [MC-GNNAS-Dock: Multi-criteria GNN-based Algorithm Selection for Molecular Docking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26377)
*Siyuan Cao,Hongxuan Wu,Jiabao Brad Wang,Yiliang Yuan,Mustafa Misir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock extends an algorithm-selection docking framework with (1) multi-criteria evaluation including PoseBusters validity, (2) residual connections, and (3) rank-aware loss, yielding improved docking pose prediction on ~3200 PDBBind complexes, outperforming the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Docking performance varies across contexts; a robust, accurate, and rank-aware algorithm-selection framework is needed to consistently predict ligand-target interactions and reduce false positives, aided by validity checks.

Method: Enhancements to MC-GNNAS-Dock: (1) multi-criteria evaluation combining RMSD with PoseBusters validity checks; (2) architectural refinements via residual connections; (3) rank-aware loss for improved ranking; evaluation on a curated dataset of ~3200 protein–ligand complexes from PDBBind.

Result: Demonstrates consistent superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD <1Å (2Å) with PoseBuster validity, compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Conclusion: The enhanced MC-GNNAS-Dock delivers improved docking performance across rigorous, composite evaluation criteria, highlighting the value of multi-criteria evaluation, architectural improvements, and rank-aware learning in an algorithm-selection docking framework.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

### [275] [Commmunication-Efficient and Accurate Approach for Aggregation in Federated Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26399)
*Le-Tuan Nguyen,Minh-Duong Nguyen,Seon-Geun Jeong,Dung D. Le,Quoc-Viet Pham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLoRA-NA is a FedLoRA variant that uses server-side surrogate aggregation to approximate the global LoRA update with B̂Â, reducing the local-global gap without extra communication, and achieving state-of-the-art global performance with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FedLoRA updates are inexact, causing a local-global generalization gap and often incurring substantial communication overhead. There is a need for scalable, accurate aggregation that preserves performance while remaining communication-efficient.

Method: The server leverages local LoRA matrices to estimate aggregated matrices Â and B̂, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. The practical update is ∇Ŵ = B̂Â, which closely approximates the ideal ∇Wbar = Σ_u B_uA_u, without adding communication beyond vanilla FedLoRA.

Result: Extensive evaluations across NLP understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving tasks on various foundation models show that FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication overhead.

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA effectively narrows the local personalization–global generalization gap and preserves communication efficiency, addressing key limitations of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

### [276] [OntoAligner Meets Knowledge Graph Embedding Aligners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26417)
*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recasts ontology alignment as KG embedding–based link prediction using 17 models in OntoAligner; achieves high-precision alignments in structure-rich domains; moderate recall; presents embedding-based OA as a complementary, efficient alternative to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have dominated semantic OA for contextual reasoning, but Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) offers scalable, structure-aware representations. OA lacks broad evaluation across many KGE models; a modular framework to assess KGEs on OA can reveal where they excel or struggle and enable hybrid approaches.

Method: Reformulate OA as a link prediction task over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples. Develop a modular OntoAligner-based framework supporting 17 diverse KGE models. Learn embeddings from the merged ontology and align entities by cosine similarity of their embeddings.

Result: ConvE and TransF deliver high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional OA systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains. Recall is moderate, indicating a tendency toward conservative, high-confidence mappings. Evaluation across seven benchmark datasets in five domains (Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science & Engineering, Biomedical Machine Learning) demonstrates the broad applicability of KGEs for OA.

Conclusion: Embedding-based OA is a promising and complementary approach to LLM-based methods. KGEs preserve and exploit ontology structure efficiently, enabling hybrid models and adaptive strategies that balance precision and coverage.

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

### [277] [Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26440)
*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer-based DCE-MRI lesion classifier (SegFormer) achieves high lesion-level AUC and strong patient-level sensitivity, with interpretability via semantic segmentation; introduces BreastDCEDL_AMBL, a public baseline dataset for benign/malignant breast lesions, enabling reproducible benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve specificity in breast DCE-MRI to reduce false positives and unnecessary biopsies; fill the lack of public, annotated benign lesions datasets for benign-malignant classification and reproducible benchmarking.

Method: Use SegFormer transformer architecture for lesion-level classification and semantic segmentation of malignant pixel distribution; curated AMBL-derived BreastDCEDL_AMBL dataset (88 patients, 133 lesions; 89 benign, 44 malignant); expanded training cohort to >1,200 patients via integration with BreastDCEDL; transfer learning with primary tumor-only annotations; public release of dataset, models, and protocols.

Result: AUC 0.92 for lesion-level classification; 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at patient level; interpretable segmentation; potential reduction of ~one-third unnecessary biopsies without missing cancers; first standardized DCE-MRI lesion benchmark; dataset publicly released.

Conclusion: Transformer-based segmentation-classification framework with standardized benchmark can facilitate clinical deployment and methodological advancement in DCE-MRI lesion classification; addressing infrastructure gaps and enabling reproducibility.

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

*Alessio Masano,Matteo Pennisi,Federica Proietto Salanitri,Concetto Spampinato,Giovanni Bellitto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fully decentralized zero-shot federated learning (ZeroDFL) enables CLIP prompt adaptation without a central server, achieving strong generalization with dramatically reduced communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated prompt-learning approaches like FedCoOp/FedTPG struggle with generalization gaps, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server; a scalable, privacy-preserving decentralized solution is needed for adapting vision-language models across distributed clients.

Method: An iterative prompt-sharing protocol where each client locally optimizes prompts and exchanges textual prompts with peers, enabling zero-shot generalization in a fully decentralized setting while greatly reducing communication.

Result: Evaluated on nine diverse image classification datasets; ZeroDFL consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art federated prompt methods and reduces communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

Conclusion: ZeroDFL demonstrates improved generalization, scalability, efficiency, and privacy in federated zero-shot learning, enabling decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [279] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit strong self-preference (self-love) biases, more pronounced in non-API settings; manipulating assumed identity triggers self-love, linking recognition to bias. The bias affects consequential tasks (hiring, security, medical chatbots), and API models often lack self-recognition, enabling causal tests. This undermines neutrality and has governance implications for model design and deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether you can disentangle artificial self-preference from human-like selfhood in LLMs, and to assess how such biases affect judgment, decision-making, and safety in practical applications.

Method: Five studies totaling ~20,000 queries across four LLMs. Methods include word-association tasks; comparative prompts with own vs competitor identifiers; API vs non-API interactions; explicit identity manipulations (telling an LLM it is itself or another model); and evaluation in job candidature, security software proposals, and medical chatbot scenarios.

Result: A robust self-preference bias exists in LLM cognition. Self-love tracks assigned identity rather than true self-identity, with API models often lacking clear self-recognition, enabling causal manipulation. The bias appears in consequential settings beyond simple word tasks, affecting proposals and evaluations.

Conclusion: Self-love biases in LLMs challenge the central promise of neutrality in judgment. The findings prompt governance and design changes by corporate model developers to address identity- and self-preference-driven biases and to safeguard fair decision-making.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [280] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-turn jailbreak attack, STaR-Attack, exploits cross-modal generation-understanding in Unified Multimodal Models to inject adversarial content without semantic drift. It uses a three-act narrative to generate supportive images and a benign-question quiz to force the model to reveal the malicious query, achieving high attack success and exposing a critical safety vulnerability needing stronger alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMMs fuse generation and understanding across modalities, creating unique vulnerabilities not addressed by single-modality or prompt-rewriting attacks. Prior work overlooks cross-modal information injection and spatio-temporal context exploitation.

Method: STaR-Attack defines a malicious event correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal narrative. It uses a three-act framework to craft pre-event and post-event scenes while camouflaging the malicious event as a hidden climax. In the first two rounds, the model is prompted to generate images for these scenes; then an image-based question guessing game is used to embed the malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the context.

Result: Experiments show STaR-Attack consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpassing FlipAttack.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical, underexplored safety vulnerability in UMMs and underscores the need for robust safety alignments and defenses against cross-modal adversarial injections.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

*Alaleh Azhir,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ML in medicine tends to optimize for population averages, neglecting rare but clinically critical cases; defines rarity and weighted objectives to surface ethical priorities; emphasizes detecting exceptional cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the “average patient fallacy” where models trained on prevalence bias miss rare, high-stakes cases, conflicting with precision medicine. Demonstrated via oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology vignettes showing missed rare responders and delayed atypical emergencies.

Method: Conceptual analysis with reference to mixture-model gradients; proposes operational fixes: Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives; advocates structured deliberation for weight selection.

Result: The abstract demonstrates that prevalence-driven training underrepresents rare cases, leading to missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and poor performance on vision-threatening variants.

Conclusion: AI in medicine must detect exceptional cases due to their significance; weight selection should follow ethical deliberation and be made explicit through defined metrics and objectives.

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

concern and new regulations for the ethical and responsible use of AI,
implementing AI governance frameworks could help to integrate AI within
organisations and mitigate associated risks. However, the rapid technological
advances and lack of shared ethical AI infrastructures creates barriers to
their practical adoption in businesses. This paper presents a real-world AI
application at TVS Supply Chain Solutions, reporting on the experience
developing an AI assistant underpinned by large language models and the

### [283] [Combining Knowledge Graphs and NLP to Analyze Instant Messaging Data in Criminal Investigations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26487)
*Riccardo Pozzi,Valentina Barbera,Renzo Alva Principe,Davide Giardini,Riccardo Rubini,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG+NLP for semantically enriching WhatsApp data in investigations; supports graph-based and semantic-search exploration with provenance to original data; early prototypes show potential, with positive prosecutor feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Criminal investigations require efficient analysis of instant messaging data; current manual approaches are labor-intensive and error-prone; need structured, traceable representations to enable reliable querying and insights.

Method: Extract messages; model as knowledge graph; generate voice message transcriptions; apply end-to-end entity extraction; provide two insight tools: graph querying/visualization and semantic search; ensure data provenance by linking back to original data.

Result: Early results and prototypes developed; applied to real investigation data; positive feedback from prosecutors; identified opportunities and future research directions.

Conclusion: The integrated KG-NLP approach is promising for investigative workflows; practical applicability demonstrated; further work to refine extraction, enrichment, and user-facing analytics; ongoing project with real data.

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

### [284] [OffTopicEval: When Large Language Models Enter the Wrong Chat, Almost Always!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26495)
*Jingdi Lei,Varun Gumma,Rishabh Bhardwaj,Seok Min Lim,Chuan Li,Amir Zadeh,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Operational safety for LLM agents is defined and measured with OffTopicEval. Across six model families (20 open-weight LLMs), all are highly unsafe at refusing off-topic queries, though model performance varies widely. Prompt-based grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground) can substantially boost refusals, with P-ground often delivering larger gains (e.g., Llama-3.3 +41%, Qwen-3 +27%). These results illustrate the urgent need for operational safety interventions and position prompt-based steering as a promising first step toward safer LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safe deployment of LLM-based agents by focusing on operational safety in specific use cases, not just generic harms. Enterprise needs go beyond broad safety concerns to ensuring agents appropriately accept or refuse queries aligned with their intended purpose.

Method: Define operational safety for LLM-based agents and develop OffTopicEval as an evaluation suite to measure safety in general and within agentic use cases. Evaluate six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs on their ability to refuse off-topic queries. Propose prompt-based steering techniques: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), and quantify their impact on out-of-distribution refusals.

Result: All evaluated models are operationally unsafe to varying degrees. Strongest models show 77.77% (Qwen-3, 235B) and 79.96% (Mistral, 24B) refusals? depending on how measured. GPT family scores lie in the 62–73% range; Phi 48–70%; Gemma 39.53%; Llama-3 23.84%. Q-ground offers up to 23% improvement; P-ground yields larger boosts, e.g., Llama-3.3 (70B) +41%, Qwen-3 (30B) +27%.

Conclusion: Operational safety remains a core alignment challenge. Prompt-based grounding shows promise as a first-step intervention to enhance refusals in off-topic or misaligned prompts, but substantial gaps remain before safe production-use deployment of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

*Yutong Dai,Krithika Ramakrishnan,Jing Gu,Matthew Fernandez,Yanqi Luo,Viraj Prabhu,Zhenyu Hu,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Zeyuan Chen,Ran Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCUBA is a benchmark evaluating computer-use agents on Salesforce CRM workflows with 300 tasks across three personas, revealing large performance gaps between open-source and closed-source agents; demonstration-augmented settings boost task success and efficiency, aiming to accelerate enterprise task automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic, interpretable benchmarks for automating complex enterprise software tasks, especially CRM workflows in Salesforce, enabling fair comparison across agent types and encouraging robust agentic solutions.

Method: Constructed SCUBA from real user interviews, 300 task instances across platform administrators, sales reps, service agents; deployed in Salesforce sandbox environments with parallel execution; implemented fine-grained milestone metrics; evaluated zero-shot and demonstration-augmented agents; compared open-source vs closed-source models.

Result: Zero-shot: open-source models yield <5% success; closed-source up to 39%; demonstration-augmented: up to 50% success; time reduced by 13%; cost reduced by 16%. Noted performance gaps between agent paradigms and between open- and closed-source models (e.g., OSWorld as related benchmark).

Conclusion: SCUBA provides a realistic, interpretable benchmark to advance enterprise task automation and reliable computer-use agents within complex business software ecosystems, highlighting challenges and the potential of agentic solutions.

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

*Jovan Stojkovic,Chaojie Zhang,Íñigo Goiri,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A holistic AI datacenter lifecycle management framework optimizes total cost of ownership (TCO) across building, refresh, and operation stages, achieving up to 40% TCO reduction compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI workloads with fast-evolving models and high hardware demands cause rising TCO; traditional datacenter lifecycle models are ill-suited for AI-scale workloads and diverse hardware profiles.

Method: 3-stage analysis (building, hardware refresh, operation) to understand how power, cooling, and networking provisioning affect TCO; explore hardware-refresh strategies aligned with evolving trends; apply operation-level software optimizations; propose a holistic lifecycle management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across stages while accounting for workload dynamics and aging.

Result: Demonstrates that stage-wise optimizations yield TCO savings and presents a holistic framework; reports up to 40% TCO reduction over traditional approaches and provides guidelines for managing AI datacenter lifecycle in the future.

Conclusion: Full potential is unlocked by coordinating decisions across building, refresh, and operation; the proposed framework offers practical guidelines to manage AI datacenters as hardware evolves and workloads change.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

### [287] [HilbertA: Hilbert Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26538)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Wenbo Lu,Yuxuan Xia,Haomin Liu,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA is a 2D-aware GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism for diffusion transformers that uses Hilbert-curve token ordering, a sliding layer-wise schedule, and a small central shared region; achieves up to 4.17x speedups at 2048x2048 high-resolution generation with comparable or better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The design of sparse attention for diffusion transformers struggles to reconcile 2D spatial locality with GPU efficiency; existing methods enforce 2D locality but suffer uncoalesced memory access, limiting high-resolution performance. A hardware-aligned, 2D-aware sparse attention is needed to enable scalable high-res image generation.

Method: Reorder image tokens along Hilbert curves to obtain a contiguous memory layout while preserving local neighborhoods. Use a sliding schedule across layers to propagate long-range information without repeated or uncoalesced memory access. Add a small central shared region to improve cross-tile communication and positional awareness. Implemented in Triton and evaluated on Flux.1-dev hardware.

Result: HilbertA delivers comparable or superior image quality to baselines while achieving substantial speedups: about 2.3x faster at 1024×1024 and up to 4.17x faster at 2048×2048 on Flux.1-dev.

Conclusion: Hardware-aligned 2D sparse attention is feasible for high-resolution image generation; HilbertA demonstrates that combining Hilbert-curve token ordering, sliding layer schedules, and a central shared region can dramatically improve GPU efficiency without sacrificing image quality.

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CritPt is a new benchmark of 71 unpublished physics research tasks (190 checkpoints) to test LLMs on real research-level reasoning; current models score only ~4-10%, revealing a large gap to practical physics research needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what kinds of reasoning tasks physicists want LLMs to assist with and to quantify LLMs' ability to tackle research-like challenges beyond academic exercises; provide a realistic, standardized evaluation that maps to real physics research demands.

Method: CritPt comprises 71 composite research challenges spanning major physics areas, each simulated as full-scale entry-level projects and decomposed into 190 checkpoint tasks. Problems are authored by 50+ active physics researchers and hand-curated for guess-resistant, machine-verifiable answers, with an automated grading pipeline tailored to physics-specific outputs.

Result: Base models show limited performance: the best average accuracy among base models is 4.0% (GPT-5 high), rising to ~10% when equipped with coding tools. Isolated checkpoint performance is only an early sign of potential, but full research-scale challenges remain unsolved.

Conclusion: CritPt provides a realistic, standardized benchmark to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools for physics research and highlights the gap between current LLM capabilities and the demands of frontier physics problem solving.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

### [289] [Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26584)
*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Metamorphic testing reveals fairness vulnerabilities in sentiment analysis within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline across three small language models. Minor demographic perturbations—especially racial cues—can violate about one-third of metamorphic relations, indicating bias amplification via retrieval. The work underscores the need for careful curation of the retrieval component and provides a practical alert for developers, testers, and small organizations adopting accessible SLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness bugs in LLMs and in RAG systems, where demographic cues can inappropriately influence outcomes, and to curb hallucinations and bias amplification through retrieved content.

Method: Metamorphic testing with controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis. Evaluates three small language models hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B) integrated into a RAG pipeline.

Result: Minor demographic variations break up to ~1/3 of metamorphic relations. A bias hierarchy is observed, with racial cues being the predominant source of violations. Retrieval in RAG can amplify bias, underscoring the need for careful retrieval data curation.

Conclusion: Retrieval components in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings offer practical guidance for developers, testers, and small organizations adopting accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

*Maël Macuglia,Paul Friedrich,Giorgia Ramponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BRIDGE unifies offline reward-free demonstrations with online preference-based feedback via an uncertainty-weighted objective; it provides regret bounds showing offline data improves online sample efficiency and outperforms behavioral cloning and online PB-RL in MuJoCo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL in real-world domains is hindered by hard reward design and unsafe exploration, leading to data-inefficient and risky learning; a principled offline-to-online framework leveraging expert data and human preferences can enhance safety and sample efficiency.

Method: Two-stage framework: offline stage learns a safe initial policy from reward-free expert demonstrations; online stage fine-tunes with preference-based human feedback. BRIDGE integrates both signals with an uncertainty-weighted objective, and the authors derive regret bounds linking offline data quantity to online sample efficiency. Experiments conducted in discrete and continuous MuJoCo tasks.

Result: Regret bounds shrink as the number of offline demonstrations increases; empirically BRIDGE achieves lower regret than behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL, indicating improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation and practical algorithm for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents by coherently combining offline demonstrations and online human feedback.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces measurement trees, a hierarchical, interpretable metric framework that aggregates heterogeneous signals into a multi-level representation, enabling transparent AI evaluation; includes definitions, examples, large-scale deployment, and open-source Python code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics often yield single values and lack transparency for complex constructs; there is a need to broaden AI evaluation with interpretable, multi-source evidence and integration of diverse signals (agentic, business, energy, sociotechnical, security, etc.).

Method: Proposes measurement trees as a class of hierarchical directed graphs where each node summarizes its children with user-defined aggregations; provides definitions and examples; demonstrates utility via a large-scale measurement exercise; offers open-source Python implementation.

Result: Shows practicality and potential for improved interpretability and evidence integration in AI evaluation; measurement trees can incorporate heterogeneous signals and produce a structured, transparent representation; accompanying open-source code.

Conclusion: Measurement trees offer a principled, transparent framework for measuring complex constructs, enabling broader and more interpretable AI evaluation by combining diverse evidence; lays groundwork for future adoption and refinements.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

TL;DR: A SELFIES-based latent diffusion model (SOLD) designs target-specific molecules by operating in a SELFIES-derived latent space, featuring a SELFIES transformer and a loss-balancing scheme for multi-task training; it yields efficient, high-affinity molecules conditioned on a protein target.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: De novo drug design is hindered by methods that generate molecules directly in 3D conformational space, which is slow and complex. A faster, protein-conditioned generation approach in a latent space could accelerate discovery.

Method: Introduce SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a latent diffusion model that operates in a latent space derived from 1D SELFIES strings and is conditioned on a target protein. Train a SELFIES transformer and propose a novel loss-balancing strategy for multi-task learning.

Result: The model can generate high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient manner, with potential for improvement by incorporating more data.

Conclusion: SOLD provides an efficient framework for protein-targeted de novo molecule design, delivering high-affinity candidates and offering clear paths for future enhancement through larger datasets and further model refinements.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

*Zhuoning Xu,Xinyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vision-language hierarchical semantic alignment (VLHSA) framework guides jigsaw puzzle assembly using textual descriptions to complement visual cues, combining dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning; it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing puzzle errors (e.g., a 14.2-point gain in piece accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-only puzzle solvers struggle with eroded gaps and semantic ambiguity; incorporating natural-language context can provide higher-level semantic guidance to improve piece compatibility and global consistency.

Method: Introduce VLHSA module that performs multi-level semantic alignment between visual patches and textual descriptions, from local token-level cues to global context. Use a multimodal architecture with two visual encoders plus language features to enable cross-modal reasoning for puzzle assembly.

Result: The proposed framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets, achieving large gains in piece accuracy (notably 14.2 percentage points). Ablation studies show the VLHSA module is critical for performance improvements over vision-only baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal semantic insights into jigsaw puzzle solving establishes a new paradigm, demonstrating that natural-language guidance can effectively complement visual cues for challenging assembly tasks.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

*Jin Li,Zhebo Wang,Tianliang Lu,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, inference-time method that uses spectral analysis of recent logits to sharpen the output distribution without retraining, improving reasoning task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy-based inference methods incur high computational overhead and often fail to leverage historical token context; there is a need for an efficient, context-aware, inference-time optimization.

Method: Maintain a sliding buffer of top-K logits, perform on-the-fly SVD to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescale logits based on entropy and logit-gap statistics; only activate when uncertainty is high; no model parameter updates.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple public benchmarks shows SLS consistently outperforms baselines, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Spectral Logit Sculpting offers a lightweight, inference-time sharpening technique that preserves contextual consistency by leveraging spectral and entropic properties of recent logits without modifying model parameters, with broad applicability to reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poly-GRACE enables HE-compatible self-supervised graph learning by using a polynomial-friendly GCN encoder and a polynomial-based contrastive loss, achieving private pre-training with competitive results on standard benchmarks; notably, it surpasses the non-private baseline on CiteSeer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving graph learning is hindered by reliance on non-polynomial operations in SSL methods (e.g., GRACE). Homomorphic Encryption requires polynomial computations, so there is a need for an HE-friendly SSL pipeline for graphs.

Method: Introduce a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a polynomial-based contrastive loss to enable self-supervised learning under homomorphic encryption. Evaluate on three benchmark datasets with private pre-training.

Result: Poly-GRACE enables private pre-training on Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed and achieves competitive performance with standard non-private baselines; on CiteSeer it even outperforms the non-private baseline.

Conclusion: The work marks a significant step toward practical, high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning by making SSL compatible with HE through polynomial constructs.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

### [296] [Hyperbolic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25206)
*Yanke Wang,Kyriakos Flouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hyperbolic Adam extends Hyperbolic SGD on Riemannian manifolds (Poincaré ball) to accelerate early training, demonstrated on diffusion models with hyperbolic Langevin dynamics, achieving faster convergence on some datasets without loss of generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage Riemannian optimization in hyperbolic space to improve learning of Poincaré embeddings and potentially other non-Euclidean settings, especially when parameters are far from the optimum; aim to accelerate convergence early in training.

Method: Develop Hyperbolic Adam by extending Hyperbolic SGD within the hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) setting; apply hyperbolic time-discretization of Langevin dynamics to train diffusion models, highlighting the benefits of hyperbolic optimization for embedding learning.

Result: Faster convergence in the early training phase and on certain datasets, with maintained generative quality in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic optimization can speed up training without sacrificing output quality, with notable gains in early convergence and potential applicability beyond hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

*Yebin Lim,Susik Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can aid feature engineering for tabular data, but reliability varies by dataset; a multi-level framework assessing key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values shows potential to boost few-shot accuracy (up to 10.52%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability concerns of LLM-driven feature engineering amid output variability, by developing a robust, cross-domain evaluation framework.

Method: Propose a multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework that analyzes LLM-generated features across datasets with respect to (1) key variables, (2) relationships among variables, and (3) decision boundary values for target classes; empirically assess robustness and its impact on few-shot prediction.

Result: Robustness of LLM-generated features varies significantly across datasets; higher-quality LLM features can improve few-shot prediction by up to 10.52%.

Conclusion: The work sets a new direction for evaluating and improving the reliability of LLM-based feature engineering across domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
feature engineering for tabular data, but concerns about their reliability
persist, especially due to variability in generated outputs. We introduce a
multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work
opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven
feature engineering in various domains.

### [298] [DPSformer: A long-tail-aware model for improving heavy rainfall prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25208)
*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer introduces a long-tail aware rainfall forecasting model with a high-resolution branch that substantially improves heavy rainfall prediction, achieving a CSI rise from 0.012 to 0.067 for ≥50 mm/6 h and an FSS > 0.45 for the top 1% events, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation is highly imbalanced, with rare heavy rainfall events. This imbalance hampers deep learning models’ ability to predict extremes. A long-tailed learning approach is needed to enrich the representation of heavy events and improve forecast accuracy and warning capabilities.

Method: Propose DPSformer, a long-tail-aware model featuring a high-resolution branch to boost heavy rainfall representation. Evaluated against a baseline NWP model using metrics such as CSI and FSS for heavy rainfall thresholds (≥50 mm/6 h) and top 1% event coverage.

Result: For heavy rainfall ≥50 mm/6 h, CSI improves from 0.012 (baseline) to 0.067. For the top 1% of heavy events, FSS exceeds 0.45, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: A practical, effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall forecasting that can enhance early warning systems and reduce societal impacts of extreme rainfall.

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

### [299] [STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210)
*Hao Chen,Tao Han,Jie Zhang,Song Guo,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel AI-driven framework STCast for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation, using Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) to initialize and refine boundaries and Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) to route monthly atmospheric variables to specialized experts, achieving superior performance across four forecasting tasks including extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static and imprecise regional boundaries hinder generalization in regional weather forecasting. An adaptive boundary mechanism and temporally specialized modeling could improve regional accuracy and robustness, particularly for extreme events.

Method: Introduce Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) to align global and regional spatial distributions for boundary initialization and adaptive refinement based on attention patterns. Develop Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) that routes atmospheric variables from different months through specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution to capture temporal patterns. Evaluate on four tasks: global/regional forecasting, extreme event prediction, and ensemble forecasting.

Result: STCast demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks in experiments, indicating effective adaptive boundary optimization and temporal specialization for weather forecasting.

Conclusion: Adaptive boundary optimization via SAA and temporal routing via TMoE enable more accurate and robust regional weather forecasts, with benefits extending to extreme-event and ensemble forecasting.

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

### [300] [LEMs: A Primer On Large Execution Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25211)
*Remi Genet,Hugo Inzirillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of Large Execution Models (LEMs): a unified transformer-based framework for flexible-time-bound execution problems that decouples market processing from allocation, achieving superior performance on crypto intraday and multi-day Dow Jones equity trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to move beyond fixed-duration VWAP-like execution to flexible time horizons with multiple constraints; unify diverse execution objectives under a single model and leverage shared market understanding.

Method: Introduce LEMs architecture with a common feature extractor (TKANs, VSNs, multi-head attention) and separate allocation networks for different execution scenarios (fixed quantity/notional, buy/sell); applies to various time horizons; empirical evaluation on intraday crypto and multi-day Dow Jones equities.

Result: LEMs achieve superior execution performance vs traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints; architecture enables deployment across scenarios with shared market context, offering operational advantages.

Conclusion: A single, flexible framework can cover diverse execution tasks more efficiently than asset-specific models, with potential broad applicability in real-time trading systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

### [301] [Six Sigma For Neural Networks: Taguchi-based optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25213)
*Sai Varun Kodathala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Taguchi design-of-experiments (DOE) is applied to CNN hyperparameter optimization for boxing action recognition, using an L12(211) plan to test eight hyperparameters across 12 configs; a multi-objective weighting with log-scale losses identifies learning rate as the key driver, with Approach 3 (weighted accuracy and log losses) delivering high accuracy and low losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in CNNs is computationally expensive and often ad hoc. This work adapts Taguchi DOE to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action recognition, aiming for efficient, principled parameter prioritization.

Method: Employed an L12(211) orthogonal array to evaluate eight hyperparameters (image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, horizontal flip) across twelve configurations. Developed five multi-objective approaches to optimize training/validation accuracy and losses via Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis, using a novel logarithmic scaling to unify conflicting metrics within the Taguchi framework.

Result: Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy with minimal losses. Taguchi analysis identified learning rate as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function.

Conclusion: The Taguchi DOE framework provides clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization for boxing action recognition and demonstrates a viable method for efficient multi-objective optimization in CNNs, with potential applicability to other domains.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

### [302] [On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25214)
*Rongguang Ye,Ming Tang,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA lets a single adapter configuration adapt to arbitrary per-layer quantization settings without retraining a separate adapter for each setting, using a configuration-aware model and Pareto-based training config search; it matches or surpasses per-configuration finetuning with no extra time cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices vary in compute and memory, and current quantization+LoRA approaches require training a separate LoRA for every quantization setting, which is costly. A single model that maps configurations to suitable low-rank adjustments can reduce setup time and adapt to heterogeneous devices.

Method: Introduce a configuration-aware model that predicts low-rank LoRA adjustments conditioned on the per-layer bit-width configuration. Use a Pareto-based search to construct a training configuration set that covers diverse total bit-width budgets, ensuring accurate adjustments without extensive retraining for each config.

Result: Empirical results show CoA-LoRA achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods that fine-tune a LoRA per configuration, while incurring no additional time cost for handling different configurations.

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA demonstrates effective dynamic adaptation of LoRA adapters to arbitrary quantization configurations with an efficient training configuration search, enabling privacy-preserving edge deployments without per-config finetuning overhead.

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

### [303] [Anomaly detection by partitioning of multi-variate time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25215)
*Pierre Lotte,André Péninou,Olivier Teste*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new unsupervised partition-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series (PARADISE) that clusters inter-variable correlations to form subsets and then applies local detectors, showing improved performance on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional multivariate time series is challenging when variables are interdependent. Global detectors may miss localized anomalies or require supervision. PARADISE preserves inter-variable relationships by partitioning variables based on correlations and applying localized anomaly detection.

Method: Compute multiple correlation coefficients among variables; cluster these coefficients to partition variables into subsets with strong internal relationships while keeping cross-subset relations intact; run anomaly detection algorithms locally on each subset (unsupervised) and aggregate results.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets from the literature report significant improvements in anomaly detection performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Partitioning based on the correlation structure while preserving inter-variable relations is effective for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series; future work could explore clustering choices, scalability, and online/adaptive partitioning.

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

### [304] [Evaluating Double Descent in Machine Learning: Insights from Tree-Based Models Applied to a Genomic Prediction Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25216)
*Guillermo Comesaña Cimadevila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study shows that double descent in test error appears only when model complexity is scaled jointly along two axes (learner capacity and ensemble size); fixing one axis preserves classical U- or L-shaped generalisation, while varying both reproduces double descent. The findings support the unfolding hypothesis and use TB isoniazid resistance prediction from whole-genome sequencing, with replication on a synthetic benchmark and available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the double descent phenomenon in a practical, non-deep-learning setting and across a multidimensional notion of model complexity, testing whether the observed effects depend on considering multiple complexity axes simultaneously.

Method: Systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes: learner capacity (e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size Pens; evaluate on a biological classification task predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis from whole-genome sequencing data, and replicate on a synthetic benchmark; analyze how generalisation patterns change with fixed vs. joint scaling of axes; provide reproducibility materials.

Result: Double descent consistently emerges only when both complexity axes are scaled together; when either axis is fixed, generalisation reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. The results support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity axis. Code and reproducibility materials are available at the stated GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Model complexity should be treated as a multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation. Double descent can be an artefact of projecting multiple regimes onto one axis; analyses should separately consider multiple complexity dimensions to properly understand and predict generalisation in ML models.

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

*Brij Malhotra,Shivvrat Arya,Tahrima Rahman,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven framework, L2C, learns to score variable-value assignments to condition MPE inference in probabilistic graphical models, using solver traces to train a neural heuristic that guides search and improves efficiency without sacrificing solution quality, even on high-treewidth graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPE in PGMs is computationally intractable; there is a need for scalable, learned heuristics to guide exact search or branch-and-bound methods.

Method: Train a neural network to score assignments based on conditioning utility. Generate scalable training data from search traces of existing MPE solvers. Use the learned model as a heuristic to guide conditioning, either before exact inference or as a branching/node-selection policy in branch-and-bound solvers.

Result: The learned heuristic substantially reduces the search space and either matches or improves solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on challenging, high-treewidth MPE queries.

Conclusion: L2C provides a scalable, data-driven conditioning heuristic for MPE inference in PGMs, enabling more efficient exact or near-exact inference by guiding search with learned signals.

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

*Tobiasz Puslecki,Krzysztof Walkowiak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DES-Clustering for TinyML enables tunable accuracy-latency-energy trade-offs in multi-class vision; larger classifier pools improve accuracy but raise inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address TinyML's stringent compute/memory/energy constraints by enabling dynamic ensemble selection to balance accuracy and latency; extend DES ideas to embedded CV tasks.

Method: Develop TinyDES-Clustering library optimized for embedded constraints; apply DES with clustering to select among a pool of classifiers for each input; evaluate on TinyML hardware; vary pool size and measure accuracy and average inference time/energy.

Result: Increasing the pool size improves classification accuracy but increases average inference time on the TinyML device; library optimized for embedded limitations.

Conclusion: DES-Clustering can flexibly trade accuracy for latency/energy in TinyML; successful implementation shows feasibility, but with higher latency for larger pools; further optimization may focus on pool management and energy-aware strategies.

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

*Yutong Liang,Chang Hou,Guy Y. Cornejo Maceda,Andrea Ianiro,Stefano Discetti,Andrea Meilán-Vila,Didier Sornette,Sandro Claudio Lera,Jialong Chen,Xiaozhou He,Bernd R. Noack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable physics-informed ML framework for sensor-based flow estimation in urban drone trajectories; uses Reynolds-number scaling, domain decomposition, cluster-based subdomain representations, and entropy-driven sensor optimization to extrapolate beyond training, demonstrated on a three-building cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban drone navigation requires reliable velocity fields and uncertainty estimates in complex, variable wind conditions. Traditional monolithic reduced-order models struggle with domain complexity and sensor placement flexibility; there is a need for extrapolation beyond training and adaptable sensor strategies.

Method: Integrates flow simulations across wind conditions as input. A physics-informed ML framework with (i) Reynolds-number scaling of flow variables, (ii) physics-based domain decomposition, (iii) cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (iv) information entropy correlating subdomains, and (v) a multivariate probability function linking sensor input to targeted velocity estimates. Outputs include velocity fields and uncertainty estimates, plus optimized sensor placements to minimize uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrated on a three-building cluster, showing scalability to complex urban geometries, ability to extrapolate to unseen wind speeds, and sensor-optimization capability. Indicates potential for city-scale adaptation and inclusion of weather inputs.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, extrapolative, sensor-aware framework for flow estimation in urban drone planning, bridging physics and machine learning; suitable for extension to larger domains and weather data integration.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Residual Linear Attention (RLA) and its delta-rule variant RDN extend linear attention with a residual-fitting mechanism using an auxiliary recurrent state to accumulate residual errors and refine the base prediction, addressing expressivity bottlenecks; they achieve improved performance while preserving linear time/memory, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention is computationally efficient (linear in sequence length) but often struggles to capture long-range dependencies due to expressivity bottlenecks. A mechanism is needed to accumulate and correct residual errors over time without sacrificing scalability.

Method: Recast linear attention as a prediction-correction process and identify an expressivity bottleneck—the need to combine a historical prediction with a single-token correction. Introduce Residual Linear Attention (RLA) with an auxiliary recurrent state that learns to accumulate residual errors and correct the base prediction. Instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net (RDN), with adaptive gating and residual clipping to control corrections and improve stability. Implementations leverage optimized linear-attention kernels to preserve linear time and memory. 

Result: Across language modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN outperform their baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers while maintaining linear scaling.

Conclusion: A residual-fitting mechanism significantly enhances the expressivity of linear attention without losing linear scalability, making RLA/RDN practical, stable alternatives to full self-attention in efficient Transformers.

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

TL;DR: AMLA is a high-performance kernel for Multi-head Latent Attention on Huawei Ascend NPUs, using a FlashAttention-based integer-only output rescaling and a Preload Pipeline with hierarchical tiling to maximize FLOPS. It achieves up to 614 TFLOPS (86.8% of theoretical max) on Ascend 910 NPUs, outperforming FlashMLA on NVIDIA hardware, and will be released within Huawei's CANN.


<details>

Motivation: Reduce KVCache memory and computational overhead of Multi-head Latent Attention during decoding, and enable efficient hardware implementation on specialized NPUs.

Method: 1) A FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces FP multiplications with integer additions for output block rescaling by exploiting FP32/INT32 binary correspondence. 2) A Preload Pipeline with hierarchical tiling to maximize FLOPS utilization, achieving Cube-bound performance and overlapping data movement with computation inside the Cube core.

Conclusion: AMLA delivers a hardware-optimized MLA kernel for Ascend NPUs with substantial FLOPS efficiency gains and near-peak utilization, suggesting strong practical viability for efficient decoding with MLA on Huawei hardware; further evaluation on broader workloads and hardware is needed.

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into

*Long Xu,Yongcai Chen,Fengshuo Liu,Yuzhong Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSCoD introduces a Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based drug design, featuring Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck and Multi-Head Cooperative Attention to tackle hierarchical and asymmetric protein–ligand interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results and real-world applicability with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structure-based drug design methods struggle to capture multi-scale, hierarchical, and asymmetric protein–ligand interactions, limiting design efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Propose MSCoD, a Bayesian updating-based generative framework. It includes Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) for semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels and a Multi-Head Cooperative Attention (MHCA) mechanism with asymmetric protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types despite dimensionality disparities.

Result: MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets; demonstrates applicability through challenging targets such as KRAS G12D; code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: The approach advances structure-based drug design by effectively modeling multi-scale and asymmetric interactions, offering a practical, open-source framework for improved molecule design.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

### [311] [Integrated Forecasting of Marine Renewable Power: An Adaptively Bayesian-Optimized MVMD-LSTM Framework for Wind-Solar-Wave Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25226)
*Baoyi Xie,Shuiling Shi,Wenqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian-optimized MVMD-LSTM framework for ultra-short-term forecasting of integrated wind-solar-wave energy systems, jointly decomposing multi-source data to capture cross-source couplings and nonlinear dynamics, yielding improved accuracy over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intermittency of offshore multi-energy resources and the limitations of per-source models that fail to capture cross-energy couplings, nonlinear/nonstationary dynamics, and require extensive parameter tuning.

Method: Apply Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to wind, solar, and wave power series to preserve cross-source couplings; use Bayesian optimization to select the number of modes and MVMD penalty to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); train an LSTM on the IMFs for ultra-short-term forecasting of the integrated system.

Result: Field experiments on an offshore energy platform in China show significant improvements over benchmark models in MAPE, RMSE, and MAE, indicating higher predictive accuracy, robustness, and automation.

Conclusion: The Bayesian-optimized MVMD-LSTM framework effectively captures cross-energy couplings and nonlinear dynamics for integrated offshore energy forecasting, enabling more secure operation and proactive dispatch with reduced need for manual tuning.

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

*Ahmad Ayaz Amin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPFs introduce injective normalizing flows using Haar-random semi-orthogonal projections to lower-dimensional latent spaces, yielding a closed-form Riemannian volume correction and a plug-and-play, efficient framework for generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop principled, efficient injective flows that surpass PCA-based or ad-hoc injective mappings by leveraging random projection theory and the geometry of projections.

Method: Use random semi-orthogonal matrices drawn from Haar distribution (via QR of Gaussian matrices) to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for the base distribution; derive a closed-form Riemannian volume correction; provide a plug-and-play framework.

Result: The approach is theoretically grounded and practically effective, offering a strong baseline for generative modeling and forging a link between random projection theory and normalizing flows.

Conclusion: RPFs provide a principled, efficient injective flow with a closed-form volume term, serving as a bridge between random projection theory and normalizing flows and enabling plug-and-play usage.

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

*Aaron Zweig,Mingxuan Zhang,Elham Azizi,David Knowles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes learning a metric tensor via score matching and annealed energy distillation to guide flow-based trajectories on temporal data, aiming to keep paths near the data manifold and improve geodesic flows beyond kernel/NN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectories should remain close to the data manifold; existing flow-matching approaches rely on straight paths or geodesics built from kernels/nearest-neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

Method: Use score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that captures the underlying data geometry and informs more accurate, manifold-consistent flows.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics and discusses interpolation of cell data (partial excerpt).

Conclusion: Not stated in the provided abstract excerpt.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

### [314] [WDformer: A Wavelet-based Differential Transformer Model for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25231)
*Xiaojian Wang,Chaoli Zhang,Zhonglong Zheng,Yunliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WDformer is a wavelet-based differential Transformer for multivariate time series forecasting, combining time-frequency analysis, inverted-dimension attention, and differential attention to reduce noise and improve accuracy, achieving SOTA on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting often suffers from data sparsity and noise; relying solely on time-domain or standard attention mechanisms can miss multi-domain information and overemphasize irrelevant history. A joint time-frequency representation with noise-robust attention could enhance predictive performance.

Method: Apply wavelet transform for multi-resolution time-frequency analysis; perform attention on inverted dimensions to model cross-variable relationships; introduce differential attention by taking the difference between two softmax attention matrices to focus on important information and suppress noise; train a WDformer model achieving strong results; code available.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple real-world datasets for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: Joint time-frequency representation with differential attention improves forecasting accuracy and noise robustness; the inverted-dimension attention aids cross-variable interactions; the approach is effective and generalizable, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

### [315] [Sampling via Gaussian Mixture Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25232)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A family of Gaussian Mixture Approximation (GMA) samplers for unnormalised target densities is proposed, including W-GMA, LMA, and EM-GMA. It uses a two-stage process (initialize Gaussian components and sample from a proposal, then fit the mixture to the target by optimizing weights or means/variances via a sample-based KL objective) and is gradient-free with stratified resampling. The approach yields consistent approximations and demonstrates accuracy and speed empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalised densities is challenging, especially with gradient-based or expensive methods. A gradient-free, efficient, mixture-based approach that can provide consistent approximations is desirable and potentially broadly applicable.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: (i) initialize a finite set of Gaussian components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to the unknown-density target by optimizing either only the component weights or also the means and variances, using a sample-based KL-divergence objective that relies only on evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The method is gradient-free and leverages Gaussian sampling, efficient optimisation (projected gradient descent, mirror descent, EM), and stratified resampling for robustness.

Result: The optimisation–resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild conditions, with empirical results showing accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Conclusion: GMA provides a simple, robust, and computationally efficient framework for sampling from unnormalised targets. Its gradient-free nature and multiple variants (W-GMA, LMA, EM-GMA) offer flexibility and reliable performance with consistent theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

*Kasun Eranda Wijethilake,Adnan Mahmood,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCLF introduces calibrated loss and feedback-controlled sampling to FL for IoV, yielding up to 16% gains in high heterogeneity with reduced sampling; outperforms FedAvg, Newt, and Oort on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data and device heterogeneity and resource constraints in IoV FL; current FL methods struggle to maintain accuracy while being efficient; need dynamic, utility-based client selection and adaptive sampling.

Method: Calibrated loss as a utility in participant selection; feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust client sampling frequency; evaluate against FedAvg, Newt, Oort on CIFAR-10 with varying data heterogeneity.

Result: FedCLF significantly outperforms baselines by up to 16% in high heterogeneity scenarios; achieves improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Conclusion: Calibrated loss and feedback-based sampling enhance FL performance under heterogeneity and resource constraints; beneficial for IoV networks; potential applicability to other dynamic, heterogeneous FL settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-series feature-based ML with One-vs-Rest Random Forest classifies Canon printhead failures, outperforming a rule-based baseline on weighted F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure printhead quality by diagnosing failure mechanisms from behavior of individual nozzles, using logged nozzle states over time and across the nozzle grid to detect faults.

Method: Feature-based time-series classification using time-based and spatial features derived with domain expert guidance; evaluated several traditional ML classifiers; final model is One-vs-Rest Random Forest.

Result: The proposed One-vs-Rest Random Forest model achieved the best performance and outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in weighted F1 across multiple failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: Domain-guided feature engineering for time-series data is effective for printhead fault diagnosis, showing promise for practical monitoring and early failure detection in manufacturing.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

*Sri Vatsa Vuddanti,Aarav Shah,Satwik Kumar Chittiprolu,Tony Song,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Maheep Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALADIN is a framework that enables fault-tolerant tool-augmented language agents by training on failure-rich data and recovering via exemplar-based retrieval, achieving strong recovery and task success even on unseen tool APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tool-based agents suffer cascading failures due to tool malfunctions (timeouts, API errors, inconsistent outputs). Traditional training focuses on success trajectories and fails to expose models to such failures.

Method: Create 50k+ recovery-annotated trajectories through systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on ToolBench. Fine-tune with LoRA to preserve base capabilities while instilling recovery skills. At inference, detect errors and retrieve the closest recovery exemplar (55+ cases) aligned with ToolScan taxonomy, then apply the corresponding recovery action.

Result: PALADIN achieves high recovery and task performance: RR improves from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57% absolute). It outperforms CRITIC (76.34%) by 13.3%. Vanilla agents reach ~89.86% RR vs 23.75% baseline. Generalizes to unseen tool APIs with 95.2% recovery.

Conclusion: PALADIN offers an effective, generalizable approach to building fault-tolerant tool-using agents capable of robust recovery in real-world tool environments.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

*Ming Yang,Xiaofan Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Dengliang Shi,Jintao Du,Yu Cheng,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAMMER: a diversity-driven, Hamiltonian-path based curriculum RL for LLMs that orders training samples to enhance exploration; shows 3-4% accuracy gains across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current curriculum RL for LLMs relies on difficulty-based annotations, which can cause local optimization and reduced exploration. Incorporating diversity metrics from dataset evaluation into the RL loop may improve generalization and stable convergence.

Method: Introduce HAMMER framework that transfers diversity metrics into dynamic RL. Training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path to promote early exploration. The approach aims for stable convergence with diversity-driven ordering and provides theoretical generalization bound arguments.

Result: Empirically, HAMMER stimulates model curiosity and achieves about 3% to 4% average accuracy gains across diverse inference benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diversity-driven, Hamiltonian-path-based sample ordering helps maintain exploration, improve generalization, and yield consistent performance gains in curriculum RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with SFT, LoRA, and QLoRA improves cybersecurity Q&A; LoRA/QLoRA match SFT performance at a fraction of the cost for efficient domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suboptimal zero-shot performance of general-purpose LLMs in specialized domains like cybersecurity; need to embed domain expertise within model parameters while keeping computational efficiency.

Method: Compare three fine-tuning strategies—Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)—on a cybersecurity Q&A dataset and evaluate both performance and computational cost relative to the base model.

Result: All three approaches outperform the foundational model on cybersecurity Q&A; LoRA and QLoRA achieve comparable performance to SFT but with substantially lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Low-rank fine-tuning strategies effectively bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications, enabling efficient adaptation to cybersecurity tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

*Prajjwal Bhattarai,Mohammad Amjad,Dmytro Zhylko,Tuka Alhanai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature-based distillation should use geometry-aware losses (Procrustes distance and Gram-Frobenius) instead of projection-based MSE or CKA; this yields small but consistent gains in BERT/OPT across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature distillation losses (projection-based MSE, CKA) fail to capture the underlying geometry of representations, limiting transfer of structural information from teacher to student.

Method: Introduce Procrustes distance and Frobenius norm of the Feature Gram Matrix as distillation losses, compare to projection-based MSE and CKA, and evaluate on language models (BERT, OPT) for classification and instruction-following tasks.

Result: Proposed losses achieve statistically significant improvements in distillation performance, up to 2 percentage points, across language model families and tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature geometry into distillation improves transfer quality; geometry-aware losses are a promising direction for feature-based model compression.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

TL;DR: A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework with a hybrid actor design for UAV-enabled mobile crowdsensing. It jointly optimizes time-slot partitioning for sensing/communication/computation, resource allocation, and 3D UAV trajectory planning to maximize processed sensing data, formulated as a POMDP and solved with heterogeneous-agent PPO aided by CNN feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks; shows improved data processing over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and high user mobility in UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing by tightly integrating sensing, communication, and computation with UAV trajectory planning through advanced learning-based optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of time-slot partitioning, resource allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory within a non-convex stochastic framework, cast as a POMDP. Solved via multi-agent deep reinforcement learning using a heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) approach enhanced with CNNs for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture structured state-action dependencies.

Result: Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed MADRL with hybrid actor network significantly increases the amount of processed sensing data compared with benchmark methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively coordinates sensing, communication, computation, and UAV mobility under partial observability, leveraging HAPPO, CNN, and KAN to handle heterogeneity and mobility, with promising implications for scalable UAV-based MCS deployments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

TL;DR: A new RainfallBench benchmark for rainfall nowcasting (0-3h) with PWV, 5-year 15-min data from 12k GNSS stations; evaluates 20 models across 6 architectures; introduces Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF); code and datasets available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series benchmarks in meteorology focus on variables with strong periodicity (e.g., temperature, humidity) and fail to reflect model performance in practical, challenging rainfall nowcasting settings. Rainfall nowcasting is affected by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, necessitating a dedicated benchmark and methods for realistic evaluation and improvement.

Method: Dataset: five years of meteorological observations recorded at 15-minute intervals across six variables from more than 12,000 GNSS stations worldwide, including precipitable water vapor (PWV). Tasks focus on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The benchmark introduces specialized evaluation strategies for multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events and evaluates 20 state-of-the-art models across six architectures. It also introduces Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to address zero-inflation and temporal decay. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies accompany the dataset.

Result: Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the dataset’s comprehensiveness and the superiority of the proposed methodology. Across multiple models and architectures, the framework demonstrates robust performance and stability, and the BFPF module specifically targets zero-inflation and temporal decay benefits. The authors also provide code and datasets for public use.

Conclusion: RainfallBench provides a challenging, practical benchmark and methodology for rainfall nowcasting. The inclusion of PWV as an additional predictor and the BFPF plug-in to handle zero-inflation and temporal decay contribute to more robust and realistic forecasting, with code and data made available to enable replication and further research.

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

### [324] [Dynamic Policy Induction for Adaptive Prompt Optimization: Bridging the Efficiency-Accuracy Gap via Lightweight Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25267)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPN is a lightweight RL approach that adaptively selects prompting strategies to balance efficiency and accuracy, yielding major token savings with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, CoT, Self-Consistency) enforce a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. A resource-aware, adaptive prompting framework can reduce waste on simple tasks while preserving performance on harder ones.

Method: Introduce Prompt Policy Network (PPN) as a single-step MDP. Train via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a resource-explicit reward. The policy decides whether to apply costly reasoning strategies only when necessary.

Result: On arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, PPN achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: PPN provides a systematic, adaptive framework for cost-efficient LLM deployment and advances lightweight optimization techniques for scalable, sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

### [325] [A Weather Foundation Model for the Power Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25268)
*Cristian Bodnar,Raphaël Rousseau-Rizzi,Nikhil Shankar,James Merleau,Stylianos Flampouris,Guillem Candille,Slavica Antic,François Miralles,Jayesh K. Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 1.5B weather foundation model (GFT) fine-tuned on Hydro-Québec asset data delivers hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables, outperforming NWP over 6–72 h and enabling early rime-ice warnings (MaE reductions: temp −15%, precip −35%, wind −15%; day-ahead rime-ice precision 0.72).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether weather foundation models can translate global forecasts into practically useful, asset-level insights for weather-sensitive infrastructure, and whether small, high-fidelity post-training can unlock concrete resilience benefits.

Method: Fine-tune Silurian AI's Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT, 1.5B params) on Hydro-Québec asset observations (transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-masts, icing sensors) to forecast five variables (surface temp, precipitation, hub-height wind, icing risk, rime-ice on conductors) across 6–72 h lead times; compare to state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks using MAE for temp/precip/wind and precision for day-ahead rime-ice detection.

Result: The tailored GFT surpasses NWP across 6–72 h: temperature MAE −15%, total-precipitation MAE −35%, wind-speed MAE −15%; average day-ahead rime-ice detection precision 0.72, enabling several hours of actionable outage warnings.

Conclusion: Post-training WFMs with limited high-fidelity data can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence, offering asset-level forecast capabilities that bridge global models and local operational needs; broader validation and deployment considerations remain (generalization, data quality, scalability).

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

### [326] [InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25270)
*Liangjian Wen,Qun Dai,Jianzhuang Liu,Jiangtao Zheng,Yong Dai,Dongkai Wang,Zhao Kang,Jun Wang,Zenglin Xu,Jiang Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfMasking is a contrastive framework that uses infinite masking to maximize synergistic information across modalities by aligning masked/unmasked fused representations, achieving state-of-the-art on seven benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synergistic interactions across modalities are essential but undercaptured by existing methods; capturing this full spectrum is critical for strong multimodal representations.

Method: Stochastically occlude most features from each modality during fusion to create varied partial representations; align unmasked fused representations with masked ones via a mutual-information-based loss (InfMasking loss) to encode comprehensive synergistic information; provide MI approximation to make training tractable.

Result: Empirical results show enhanced synergistic information and state-of-the-art performance on seven large-scale benchmarks; code released.

Conclusion: InfMasking offers a principled way to capture richer synergistic interactions in multimodal learning and improves downstream tasks.

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

### [327] [MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278)
*Payal Mohapatra,Yueyuan Sui,Akash Pandey,Stephen Xia,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO is a sparse, modality-aware multimodal framework for real-world time-series that enables dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions, symbolic tokenization, adaptive attention budgeting, and sparse cross-modal attention, routed via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts to handle missing modalities and many modalities, achieving consistent improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal time-series data face challenges such as unclear primary modality priors, large numbers of modalities making pairwise modeling impractical, and arbitrary missing observations due to sensor failures; there is a need for robust, scalable, and flexible multimodal learning.

Method: MAESTRO enables dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions driven by task relevance, uses symbolic tokenization to construct discrete representations, applies adaptive attention budgeting to build long multimodal sequences, processes them with sparse cross-modal attention, and routes the resulting cross-modal tokens through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts to enable specialization across varying modality combinations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four diverse datasets spanning three applications shows MAESTRO achieving average relative improvements of 4% over the best existing multimodal baselines and 8% over the best multivariate baselines under complete observations; under partial observations with up to 40% missing modalities, MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement; analyses indicate robustness and efficiency due to the sparse, modality-aware design.

Conclusion: MAESTRO offers a robust and scalable solution for real-world multimodal time-series, effectively handling missing data and large modality sets through dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions and sparse MoE routing.

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DRL framework for dynamic resource allocation in HetNets jointly optimizes transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling with a multi-objective reward; PPO and TD3 are evaluated against heuristics across scenarios; DRL outperforms heuristics and reveals design trade-offs for future HetNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks is challenging due to varying user loads and channel conditions; traditional methods may fail to adapt efficiently, necessitating intelligent, scalable solutions.

Method: A DRL framework jointly optimizes transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling using a multi-objective reward combining throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. The study uses real base station coordinates and compares policy gradient method PPO and actor-critic TD3 against three heuristics across multiple network scenarios.

Result: DRL frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in dynamic network resource allocation, demonstrating the potential for improved performance and highlighting trade-offs in DRL design for future HetNets.

Conclusion: DRL approaches are promising for dynamic, multi-objective resource management in HetNets, with room for further exploration of reward shaping, algorithmic trade-offs, and real-world deployment considerations.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

*Mohammadreza Bakhtyari,Bogdan Mazoure,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,Guillaume Rabusseau,Vladimir Makarenkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces ClustRecNet, a DL-based framework to predict the best clustering algorithm for a dataset, trained on 34k synthetic datasets with ARI ground-truth labels for 10 algorithms; outperforms traditional CVIs and AutoML clustering recommenders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate clustering algorithm selection to improve unsupervised learning performance and reduce reliance on handcrafted meta-features and cluster validity indices.

Method: A neural network architecture that combines convolutional, residual, and attention modules to learn compact dataset representations; trained end-to-end using ARI-based ground truth derived from 34k synthetic datasets processed with 10 clustering algorithms; evaluates against CVIs and AutoML baselines on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Result: The approach yields notable gains: 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML method on real-world data; consistently outperforms conventional CVIs and state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommenders.

Conclusion: DL-based clustering algorithm recommendation is feasible and advantageous, enabling end-to-end dataset representation learning and direct algorithm recommendation that surpasses hand-crafted CVIs and AutoML approaches across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

### [330] [Scaling Behaviors of LLM Reinforcement Learning Post-Training: An Empirical Study in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25300)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In RL post-training of LLMs, scaling effects mirror pre-training: larger models with fixed compute or data converge faster and yield better performance; data reuse helps in data-scarce settings; these patterns hold for base and instruction-tuned models, offering practical scaling guidelines for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training is less understood than pre-training scaling laws. The study aims to uncover how model size, data volume, and compute interact to shape reasoning performance, informing efficient resource allocation.

Method: Systematic empirical study with 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, varying compute budgets, data amounts, and sample reuse, focusing on mathematical reasoning tasks and comparing base vs instruction-tuned models.

Result: Four key findings: (1) Under fixed compute, larger models trained for fewer steps outperform smaller models with more steps. (2) With fixed data, larger models achieve better sample efficiency (lower loss). (3) In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data is highly effective; total optimization steps, not sample uniqueness, drive final performance. (4) Scaling behaviors are robust across base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (faster convergence for larger models) despite differences in absolute accuracy.

Conclusion: These scaling laws provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling LLM reasoning through RL post-training, enabling more effective use of compute, data, and samples.

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

*Amirhossein Zare,Amirhessam Zare,Parmida Sadat Pezeshki,Herlock,Rahimi,Ali Ebrahimi,Ignacio Vázquez-García,Leo Anthony Celi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEO-CVAE is an entropy-guided CVAE oversampling framework that focuses on uncertain, boundary-region minority samples to improve imbalanced learning in nonlinear biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional oversampling and standard CVAEs either rely on linear interpolation or treat all minority samples equally, failing to address uncertain, overlapping regions in high-dimensional nonlinear manifolds common in omics data.

Method: Compute neighborhood class entropy as a local uncertainty signal. Use Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) to bias representation learning toward uncertain regions and entropy-guided sampling to generate more synthetic samples where class overlap is high, all within a CVAE framework.

Result: On ADNI and TCGA lung cancer datasets, LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance and outperforms both traditional oversampling methods (e.g., SMOTE variants) and generic generative baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating local uncertainty via entropy into both learning and generation within CVAEs yields more informative synthetic samples and boosts imbalanced learning in nonlinear, biomedical data contexts.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

*Shuang Liang,Guido Montúfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large-step gradient descent in matrix factorization produces fractal, near-critical dynamics; exact critical step size found for scalar-vector case; initialization strongly influences the optimizer near criticality; regularization enlarges the fractal region; overall dynamics become chaotic with no simple implicit biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify how gradient descent behaves in matrix factorization at large step sizes and whether common biases persist, particularly under regularization and varied initialization.

Method: Derive the exact critical step size for scalar-vector factorization; extend to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization; analyze behavior near criticality and under regularization; characterize fractal boundaries between convergent and divergent initializations.

Result: Identification of an exact critical step size; near-critical minimizers depend sensitively on initialization; regularization amplifies sensitivity and creates fractal boundaries; dynamics enter a chaotic regime with unpredictable long-term behavior and no persistent implicit biases toward balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Conclusion: Near-critical-step gradient descent in matrix factorization exhibits chaotic dynamics and fractal structure, challenging assumptions about bias and convergence; these effects persist with regularization and orthogonal initialization, suggesting rich, nontrivial optimization landscapes at large learning rates.

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

*Linus Aronsson,Han Wu,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning for correlation clustering in a cold-start setting; introduces a coverage-aware, diversity-promoting query strategy to reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In cold-start, there are no initial true pairwise similarities, making it hard to begin active querying efficiently. The goal is to minimize query cost while learning the cluster structure.

Method: A coverage-aware sampling strategy that prioritizes diverse coverage early on to encourage exploration, integrated with active querying for pairwise similarities.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved query efficiency and clustering effectiveness compared with baselines under cold-start conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed coverage-aware approach is effective for cost-efficient active correlation clustering in cold-start scenarios, promoting early diversity to improve learning outcomes.

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a physics-grounded, non-linear noising process for protein diffusion models, combined with SE(3) flow-matching and sequence conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art unconditional protein generation and accurate folding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based protein design methods often neglect physical realism and lack principled grounding in physics. The goal is to preserve topology, bonds, and avoid collisions while unfolding proteins into interpretable secondary structures, and to enable sequence-conditioned folding.

Method: Proposes a physically motivated non-linear noising process grounded in classical physics that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity. Integrates this process with flow-matching on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones, and incorporates sequence information to enable sequence-conditioned folding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing more designable and novel protein structures, while accurately folding monomer sequences into precise conformations.

Conclusion: Physics-grounded diffusion with SE(3) flow-matching improves realism and designability in protein generation and folding; incorporating sequence information expands generative capabilities. Future work could explore broader protein classes, efficiency, and extensions to multimeric assemblies.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

TL;DR: A model-based RL world model (TD-MPC2) trained across 10 real patient vasculatures outperforms SAC in multi-task autonomous endovascular navigation, with higher success but longer procedure times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous endovascular navigation (e.g., mechanical thrombectomy) is hard due to complex vascular anatomy and need for real-time decisions; RL methods struggle to generalize across patient vasculatures and long horizons; world models offer improved generalization.

Method: Train a single TD-MPC2 agent across multiple navigation tasks on ten real patient vasculatures; compare against Soft Actor-Critic (SAC); evaluate multi-task performance and path ratio; report procedure time trade-off.

Result: TD-MPC2 yields 65% mean success rate vs SAC 37%; better path ratio; longer procedure times indicating trade-off between success and speed.

Conclusion: World models hold promise for generalizable autonomous endovascular navigation and AI-driven robotic interventions; future work to optimize speed-accuracy trade-offs and generalization.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

*Shane Bergsma,Nolan Dey,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Training Re-evaluation Curve (TREC), a diagnostic that uses final weights to measure how well a model retains training data as a function of when the data was seen; TRECs enable predicting optimal data placement from AdamW EMA, explain prior ablations, and improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-model on 900B tokens by aligning high-quality data with TRECs minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data curricula guide LLM training but principled data placement remains unclear. A retrospective, weight-based diagnostic (TREC) can reveal which data points are valuable depending on when they are seen.

Method: Train models across sizes (111M–3.9B params), compute TRECs by retracing retention of training data relative to encounter time; demonstrate predictability of TRECs from AdamW implicit EMA; apply TRECs to published training recipes to explain ablations; align data with TREC minima to improve continual pre-training.

Result: High-quality data placed at low points on the TREC yields performance gains; TRECs can be predicted in advance; provide explanations for prior ablations; improved continual pre-training for a 3.9B LLM on 900B tokens.

Conclusion: TREC offers a practical, predictive framework for data placement in LLM training, enabling proactive curriculum design and better understanding of training data importance.

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

*Penglei Gao,Yan Zou,Abhijit Duggal,Shuaiqi Huang,Faming Liang,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework for competing risks with functional covariates and missing data, achieving better prediction accuracy than baselines on simulated and ICU data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survival analysis with competing risks and irregular, incomplete functional data; need an end-to-end model that jointly imputes missing values and learns hazard predictions to improve prognostic accuracy in critical care.

Method: Introduces Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN) with a micro-network Basis Layer to represent functional data and a gradient-based imputation module; end-to-end training for discrete-time hazards under competing risks.

Result: Demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests and traditional competing risks models on multiple simulated datasets and real-world ICU data (MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic).

Conclusion: Advances prognostic modeling in critical care by better capturing dynamic risk factors and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data, enabling more accurate risk stratification.

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

### [338] [On the Shape of Latent Variables in a Denoising VAE-MoG: A Posterior Sampling-Based Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25382)
*Fernanda Zapata Bascuñán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A VAE-MoG trained on GW150914 reconstructs signals well but exhibits a mismatch in latent space between HMC posteriors conditioned on clean inputs and encoder outputs from noisy data, underscoring that strong denoising does not guarantee reliable latent representations and highlighting the need for posterior-based validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether good reconstruction in a generative model implies meaningful latent representations, and promote validation of latent structure via posterior sampling in gravitational-wave data.

Method: Train a denoising variational autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG) on GW150914 data. Use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare these to latent encodings produced by the encoder on noisy inputs. Perform statistical comparisons of the latent spaces.

Result: The model achieves accurate reconstructions of signals, but statistical analyses reveal a clear mismatch between the posterior latent samples and the encoder’s latent representations, indicating that latent representations are not reliably captured despite good denoising performance.

Conclusion: Strong denoising performance does not guarantee reliable latent representations. Posterior-based validation is essential for evaluating the quality of latent structure in generative models, especially for gravitational-wave data.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

### [339] [Boundary-to-Region Supervision for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25727)
*Huikang Su,Dengyun Peng,Zifeng Zhuang,YuHan Liu,Qiguang Chen,Donglin Wang,Qinghe Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Boundary-to-Region (B2R), an asymmetric conditioning framework for offline safe RL that treats CTG as a safety boundary and uses cost realignment plus rotary embeddings, achieving strong safety and rewards across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetric conditioning on return-to-go (RTG) and cost-to-go (CTG) is inappropriate: RTG is a flexible performance target, while CTG should be a rigid safety bound. This mismatch can lead to constraint violations, especially on out-of-distribution cost trajectories.

Method: B2R realigns the cost signal to CTG by redefining CTG as a boundary constraint under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distributions of feasible trajectories while preserving reward structure. It also employs rotary positional embeddings to enhance exploration within the safe region.

Result: B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38 safety-critical tasks and achieves superior reward performance compared with baseline methods.

Conclusion: This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning and provides both a theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence models to safe RL; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

*Jordyn E. A. Lorentz,Katharine M. Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixsemble adapts the Dawid-Skene model to fuse outputs from multiple model-based clustering algorithms, treating their clusterings as noisy annotations. It yields robust, near-top performance rather than guaranteed best, making it practical when the true structure is unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for a robust ensemble method for clustering without ground-truth labels; leverages crowdsourcing-style EM to combine multiple algorithm outputs and mitigate individual failures, benefiting non-expert users.

Method: Repurposes the Dawid-Skene EM framework to model each clustering algorithm as an annotator producing discrete labels; estimates a latent true clustering and each annotator's reliability; aggregates by probabilistic inference across algorithms.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated and real datasets shows mixsemble generally near the best performer and avoids poor outcomes, but not always the single top; demonstrates robustness and practical value.

Conclusion: Mixsemble offers a robust, user-friendly ensemble for clustering outputs, useful when data structure is unknown; promotes reliable aggregation over chasing a single best model.

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

### [341] [Multi-Task Equation Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25400)
*S C Bee,N Dervilis,K Worden,L A Bull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task Bayesian RVM improves generalisation across varying excitations by sharing parameters across related datasets, reducing over-fitting in equation discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalisation across operating conditions is a key challenge in equation discovery; move beyond single-task fitting to leverage related data from multiple excitations.

Method: Apply a Bayesian relevance vector machine within a multi-task learning framework; treat responses from the same structure under different excitations as related tasks with shared parameters and task-specific noise; test on a simulated SDOF oscillator with linear and cubic stiffness under three excitation regimes.

Result: Single-task RVM captures responses but often misses true governing terms when non-linear dynamics are weakly excited; MTL-RVM aggregates information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for weak/moderate excitations and maintaining performance under high excitation.

Conclusion: Multi-task Bayesian inference mitigates over-fitting and enhances generalisation in equation discovery, with relevance to structural health monitoring where varying loads reveal different aspects of system dynamics.

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

### [342] [FlashOmni: A Unified Sparse Attention Engine for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25401)
*Liang Qiao,Yue Dai,Yeqi Huang,Hongyu Kan,Jun Shi,Hong An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni provides a universal sparse-attention engine for diffusion transformers, enabling diverse sparsity patterns to run within a single kernel with near-ideal speedups and significant end-to-end acceleration without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparsity-based acceleration methods for multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) require custom kernels due to diverse sparsity patterns, hindering universal deployment and hardware efficiency.

Method: Introduce flexible sparse symbols to standardize many sparsity strategies (e.g., feature caching, block-sparse skipping) and implement a single attention kernel that can execute these; design optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks; apply multi-granularity sparsity.

Result: Near-linear speedups with 1:1 sparsity ratio speedup in attention and GEMM-Q; 2.5–3.8× acceleration in GEMM-O (peak ~87.5% of theoretical); end-to-end acceleration of ~1.5× on a 33K-parameter Hunyuan model without degrading visual quality.

Conclusion: FlashOmni delivers a universal, efficient sparse attention acceleration solution across DiT architectures, enabling substantial end-to-end speedups while preserving output quality.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

### [343] [Rethinking Parameter Sharing for LLM Fine-Tuning with Multiple LoRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25414)
*Hao Ban,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reexamines why inner A matrices in multi-LoRA often look similar, attributing this mostly to identical initialization rather than shared knowledge, and shows B is more crucial for knowledge encoding. It introduces ALoRA, an asymmetric multi-LoRA with multiple A's and a single shared B for multi-task fine-tuning, and Fed-ALoRA, which shares B across clients in federated fine-tuning using a matrix-decomposition strategy to handle heterogeneous ranks. Empirical results across reasoning tasks, NLP multitask, and federated NLP show improved task balance with comparable or better average accuracy than existing multi-LoRA methods, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work observed that the A matrices in multi-LoRA tend to be highly similar during training, suggesting cross-task sharing. The authors argue this similarity largely stems from identical initialization, not shared learning, and that the B matrix plays a more critical role in encoding and transferring knowledge. This motivates designing a more flexible, resource-efficient strategy that preserves or improves performance across multiple tasks and in federated settings, while accommodating rank heterogeneity across tasks/clients.

Method: Propose ALoRA: an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple A matrices and a single shared B for multi-task fine-tuning. Propose Fed-ALoRA: shares B across clients in federated fine-tuning, incorporating a novel matrix-decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous ranks across clients. Evaluate on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP datasets, and federated NLP datasets to assess task balance and average accuracy.

Result: ALoRA and Fed-ALoRA achieve more balanced performance across tasks while maintaining comparable or superior average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. The methods demonstrate effective cross-task transfer and robustness in federated settings, with empirical validation on diverse reasoning and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Asymmetric sharing focused on a single B matrix, with multiple A's, yields better task balance and knowledge transfer than symmetric or fully shared-loRA designs. The Fed-ALoRA framework extends this benefit to federated settings, using matrix decomposition to handle heterogeneous client ranks. The approach is validated across reasoning and NLP benchmarks, and code is provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

*Dong Hyun Jeon,Lijing Zhu,Haifang Li,Pengze Li,Jingna Feng,Tiehang Duan,Houbing Herbert Song,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High Impact Attack (HIA) — a data-driven, restricted black-box attack on Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs that identifies structurally and dynamically important nodes to perform a hybrid perturbation (edge injections + deletions) with few perturbations, significantly degrading TGNN link prediction (MRR up to 35.55%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness of TGNNs to adversarial, temporally-aware attacks is underexplored; existing methods are simplistic and detectable; understanding vulnerabilities is crucial for defenses.

Method: Use a data-driven surrogate to locate structurally important and dynamically important nodes; apply a hybrid perturbation combining strategic edge injection and targeted deletions; operate under restricted black-box setting; minimize perturbations to remain stealthy; evaluate on multiple datasets and models.

Result: Attacks substantially degrade TGNN performance on link prediction; up to 35.55% decrease in MRR; outperforms baselines; demonstrated across five datasets and four TGNNs (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, TGAT).

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental vulnerabilities in STDG models; calls for defenses that jointly account for structural and temporal dynamics and for more robust attack-resistant TGNN design.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

### [345] [Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25424)
*Jubayer Ibn Hamid,Ifdita Hasan Orney,Ellen Xu,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A polychromic objective for policy gradient RLNT—RLLS? no, RLide. It maintains exploration and diversity during RL fine-tuning by adapting PPO with vine sampling and a revised advantage, improving coverage and robustness across environments like BabyAI/Minigrid/Algorithmic Creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLFT often collapses policy diversity to a few exploitable outputs, hindering exploration and limiting benefits from test-time scaling. A dedicated objective to preserve and refine diverse generations is needed.

Method: Introduce a polychromic objective and adapt PPO to optimize it. Use vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and modify the advantage function to reflect the new objective, enabling exploration-focused learning.

Result: Improved success rates across more environment configurations; better generalization under perturbations; higher coverage in pass@k, indicating a richer, more diverse repertoire of strategies.

Conclusion: A polychromic objective with vine sampling in PPO mitigates collapse, promotes exploration, and yields more robust, diverse policies with enhanced configurability across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled budget pacing controller using bucketized hysteresis and proportional feedback to stabilize spend in dynamic ad auctions, yielding improved pacing accuracy and reduced lambda-volatility in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad pacing methods rely on ad-hoc tunings, causing instability and inefficiency. A principled, scalable controller is needed to track target spend rates across campaigns.

Method: Develops a controller that integrates bucketized hysteresis with proportional feedback; provides a framework for parameter selection and theoretical analysis of spend-rate tracking; demonstrates stability and adaptability.

Result: Experiments show pacing error reduced by 13% and lambda-volatility by 54% versus a baseline, with improved delivery consistency, particularly benefiting small-budget campaigns.

Conclusion: Bridges control theory and advertising systems, offering a scalable, reliable budget pacing solution with practical benefits for campaigns across budgets.

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

### [347] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM), an intrinsic reward that promotes exploration by rewarding observed improvements in a dynamics model, using a dual-network to predict past errors and measure their decrease; addresses noisy-TV and improves sample efficiency, beating baselines in MNIST/noise, 3D maze, and Atari.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy-TV sources inject unlearnable randomness causing exploration to stall. Intrinsic rewards based on uncertainty or distribution similarity suffer from poor sample efficiency and high compute. Inspired by neuroscience that humans monitor improvements, LPM aims to reward learnable progress during exploration.

Method: Dual-network: an error model predicts the previous iteration's dynamics model error; the intrinsic reward is the difference between current error and predicted previous error, i.e., the observed improvement. This yields a zero-equivariant, monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG); the error model is necessary for monotonicity. Implemented for exploration across environments; evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, leads to more state exploration in a 3D maze, and yields higher extrinsic rewards in Atari, outperforming baselines in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The approach shifts exploration toward noise-robust learning progress monitoring, offering a simple yet effective paradigm for exploration; code is available for reproducibility.

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

### [348] [Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25439)
*Hanyuan Gao,Xiaoxuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Norm-Q introduces a normalized linear quantization with a quantization-aware EM training for probabilistic symbolic models (e.g., HMMs), achieving very high compression (up to 99% for weights) with minimal performance loss; 8-bit quantization of a 4096-state HMM is lossless, with up to 3-bit quantization incurring acceptable loss; code is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMMs and neuro-symbolic systems demand dense computation and data transfer, causing memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. There is a need to compress probabilistic symbolic models to enable deployment on resource-constrained hardware while preserving model performance.

Method: A normalized linear quantization approach (Norm-Q) coupled with a quantization-aware expectation maximization training process for probabilistic models. The method reduces data bit width while maintaining distributional properties of HMMs, enabling high compression with controlled loss; evaluated on HMM weights and constrained generation tasks.

Result: Norm-Q achieves higher compression rates with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization. It can quantize an HMM with 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss, and to at most 3 bits with acceptable loss. Overall, it achieves up to 99% compression of HMM weights. Open-source code is available.

Conclusion: Norm-Q enables effective compression of probabilistic symbolic models like HMMs, reducing memory and bandwidth demands and enabling deployment on hardware without substantial performance degradation. It demonstrates practical viability for neuro-symbolic and constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

TL;DR: Introduces Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), a joint-embedding predictive architecture for self-supervised time-series representation learning, achieving competitive classification and forecasting performance and promising as a foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerability of autoregressive/masked self-supervised methods to noise or confounds; extend JEPA to time-series to learn robust latent representations.

Method: Adapt Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures to time-series (TS-JEPA), operating in latent space with two views/augmentations, focusing on predicting cross-view latent representations rather than input reconstruction.

Result: TS-JEPA matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on multiple standard datasets for classification and forecasting; shows balanced performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: TS-JEPA provides groundwork for future time-series foundation models based on joint embedding and robust general representations.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

*Haotian Fu,Ran Gong,Xiaohan Zhang,Maria Vittoria Minniti,Jigarkumar Patel,Karl Schmeckpeper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single multitask policy from task-specific experts using a Kalman-filter-based performance-aware data scheduler; validated on MetaWorld and IsaacLab; achieves high task success with far fewer expert demonstrations and better zero-shot sim-to-real transfer than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies typically need extensive expert data or simulations. There is a need for data-efficient methods to learn multitask policies by leveraging existing task-specific expert policies.

Method: Introduce Data-Efficient multitask DAgger that distills a single multitask policy from multiple task-specific experts. A performance-aware scheduling strategy uses a Kalman-filter estimator to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks based on the observed learning benefit per task, improving data efficiency.

Result: The resulting multitask policy achieves high performance across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations. In simulation, the learned visual policy transfers zero-shot to a real robot with better performance than naive DAgger or Behavior Cloning, even without real data.

Conclusion: The approach improves data efficiency and transfer in multitask policy learning by actively prioritizing data acquisition where it yields the most benefit, demonstrating strong results on MetaWorld and IsaacLab and promising robustness for sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

*Danyang Li,Yixuan Wang,Matthew Cleaveland,Mingyu Cai,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end differentiable conformal prediction (CP) for STL inference, with a robustness-based nonconformity score and a training-time CP layer to provide statistical guarantees and improve reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STL inference currently lacks formal confidence guarantees. CP offers guarantees but is typically applied post-hoc, which doesn't influence learning. An integrated, end-to-end CP framework can improve both reliability and interpretability of STL formulas.

Method: Introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score; embed a smooth CP layer directly into training; use a novel loss that jointly optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction-set size; after training, apply exact CP to obtain statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas.

Result: Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show reduced predictive uncertainty (high coverage with smaller prediction sets) and improved accuracy under a fixed threshold compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: An end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference delivers statistical guarantees for learned formulas while enhancing reliability and interpretability; promising for safe and reliable time-series rule inference.

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hui Ji,Wei Gao,Pengfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es uses a demographic-aware diffusion framework to convert PPG signals into clinically valid 12-lead ECG, addressing inter-lead constraints and spatial-temporal dependencies; it outperforms baselines in reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome cumbersome multi-electrode 12-lead ECG setups for ambulatory monitoring and to address the inability of PPG-based methods to reconstruct multi-lead ECG due to missing inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of spatial-temporal lead dependencies.

Method: Forward process: apply frequency-domain blurring followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world distortions. Reverse process: a temporal multi-scale generation module followed by frequency deblurring. It uses KNN-based clustering with contrastive learning to assign affinity matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG translation.

Result: Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Conclusion: P2Es demonstrates a viable, demographic-aware diffusion approach to generate clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals, potentially enabling more practical ambulatory cardiovascular monitoring.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

*Dingyi Kang,Dongming Jiang,Hanshen Yang,Hang Liu,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageANN is a disk-based ANNS framework that maps graph nodes to SSD pages via a page-node graph, uses a merged disk layout with representative vectors to reduce I/O, and employs light indexing plus coordinated memory-disk allocation to boost throughput and lower latency while preserving recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disk-based ANNS suffer from long I/O traversal, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, which bottleneck scalability for large-scale vector search.

Method: Introduce a page-node graph where similar vectors are clustered into page nodes and the physical SSD pages align with graph nodes. Use a co-designed disk layout with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology, avoiding unnecessary reads. Develop a memory management strategy combining lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation to maximize host memory use and minimize query latency and storage overhead.

Result: Experimental results show PageANN achieves 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across datasets and memory budgets, with comparable high recall.

Conclusion: PageANN demonstrates a scalable, high-performance disk-based ANNS framework by aligning computation with storage granularity through page-node graphs and a merged data layout, achieving substantial throughput and latency benefits while maintaining recall; it offers a viable path for large-scale vector search where memory is a bottleneck.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

*Langzhou He,Junyou Zhu,Fangxin Wang,Junhua Liu,Haoyan Xu,Yue Zhao,Philip S. Yu,Qitian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mole-PAIR is a plug-and-play module that improves OOD reliability for molecular foundation models by formulating OOD detection as a pairwise preference ranking that optimizes AUROC, yielding significant AUROC gains under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution failures and chemical hallucination limit the reliability of molecular foundation models in high-stakes domains, necessitating reliable OOD detection and risk control.

Method: Post-training integration of a pairwise learning objective that estimates OOD affinity to rank in-distribution (ID) vs. OOD samples, effectively optimizing AUROC.

Result: Across five real-world molecular datasets, Mole-PAIR achieves substantial AUROC improvements under distribution shifts: up to 45.8% for size, 43.9% for scaffold, and 24.3% for assay.

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR offers a simple, cost-effective, plug-and-play solution to enhance OOD detection in molecular foundation models, addressing chemical hallucination without major retraining.

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LLM-driven AI agent, EEsizer, automates transistor sizing for AMS ICs through a closed-loop design process, achieving automated sizing across advanced nodes with limited human input and demonstrating robustness via variation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual transistor sizing effort in Analog/Mixed-Signal IC design and overcome knowledge gaps in AMS circuit design by leveraging LLMs integrated with simulators and data analysis.

Method: Benchmark 8 LLMs on six basic circuits, select 3 strong models, integrate with circuit simulators and custom analysis functions, apply prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought to guide iterative design. Perform 20- to 90-nm rail-to-rail CMOS operational amplifier sizing across multiple performance metrics. Validate robustness with a manually designed bias circuit and Gaussian-distributed variations of transistor dimensions and threshold voltages.

Result: OpenAI o3 achieved the target at 90 nm across three test groups within a maximum of 20 iterations. The approach demonstrated adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes; robustness assessment used Gaussian variations.

Conclusion: LLM-based AI agents can automate transistor sizing in AMS IC design with minimal human intervention, achieving cross-node applicability and robustness, suggesting potential to accelerate AMS design cycles. Further work could address broader robustness, verification, and integration into standard design flows.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

### [356] [Flow Matching with Semidiscrete Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25519)
*Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Stephen Y. Zhang,Michal Klein,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semidiscrete OT flow matching (SD-FM) offers a scalable alternative to optimal-transport flow matching (OT-FM) by replacing batch OT with a semidiscrete formulation, solving a dual with SGD, and using maximum inner product search (MIPS) for matching. It eliminates the quadratic n/ε bottleneck, achieving better training and inference performance than FM and OT-FM across datasets and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT-FM promises improved alignment of velocity fields with target data but is hampered in practice by computational costs, especially the Sinkhorn algorithm's O(n^2/ε^2) complexity. A semidiscrete approach leverages the finite size of the target dataset to enable scalable training without relying on expensive batch-OT solvers.

Method: Formulate OT flow matching as a semidiscrete optimal transport problem. Estimate the dual potential vector via SGD. At train time, sample noise vectors and match them to data points using a maximum inner product search (MIPS) instead of solving a full OT. This yields Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) with reduced complexity and better scalability.

Result: Empirically, SD-FM outperforms both standard flow matching (FM) and OT-FM on training metrics and under inference budget constraints. It is effective across unconditional/conditional generation and with mean-flow models across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SD-FM provides a practical, scalable alternative to OT-FM with strong empirical performance. By removing the quadratic dependency on n/ε and using SGD-based dual learning plus MIPS, it makes OT-based flow matching viable for realistic, large-scale training and generation tasks.

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

### [357] [Meta-Router: Bridging Gold-standard and Preference-based Evaluations in Large Language Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25535)
*Yichi Zhang,Fangzheng Xie,Shu Yang,Chong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal-inference framework to train LLM routers using both gold-standard and preference data, correcting bias and data imbalance to improve routing accuracy and cost-quality trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying a single best model per query is costly; gold-standard labels are accurate but expensive, while preference-based data are cheaper but biased. There is a need to fuse these sources to train robust routers.

Method: Frame response evaluation as a treatment assignment in a causal setting; interpret preference-data bias as conditional average treatment effect; propose integrative training that (a) debiases preference data, (b) balances two data sources, (c) improves routing robustness and efficiency.

Result: Experiments show the approach yields more accurate routing decisions and better cost–quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: Integrating gold and preference data via causal routing improves performance and scalability for model-selection routing in LLM systems.

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

*Marcus Schwarting,Logan Ward,Nathaniel Hudson,Xiaoli Yan,Ben Blaiszik,Santanu Chaudhuri,Eliu Huerta,Ian Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A queue prioritization framework that fuses generative modeling with active learning to guide inverse-design exploration, significantly boosting high-quality molecular candidates (281 vs 604 out of 1000).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI expands the search space but risks exploring low-quality regions and potential model decay; an active-learning-driven prioritization helps focus resources on promising candidates, shown in molecular design for carbon capture.

Method: A queue prioritization algorithm combines generative modeling with an active-learning model in a distributed workflow to prioritize top design candidates, preventing nonsensical outputs and stabilizing the generative process.

Result: Among 1000 novel candidates, the workflow without active learning yielded 281 high-performing candidates on average, while with active learning it yielded 604 high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: Integrating active learning into generative inverse-design workflows improves discovery efficiency and quality, reducing wasted exploration and enhancing performance in complex design spaces such as molecular structures for carbon capture.

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

*Guojun Tang,Jiayu Zhou,Mohammad Mamun,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedIF introduces a trajectory-based influence estimation for computing client contributions in federated learning, delivering scalable, robust aggregation with substantially reduced overhead, competitive with or superior to Shapley-value-based methods under noise and adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust FL under non-IID data and adversarial clients is hindered by the computational burden of Shapley-value-based contribution estimation. There is a need for scalable, efficient, and robust aggregation.

Method: FedIF uses trajectory-based influence estimation with normalized and smoothed influence scores derived from lightweight gradient operations on client updates and a public validation set. It adapts FL to a decentralized setting, includes local weight normalization, and uses influence smoothing to stabilize estimates.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noise. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST demonstrate robustness comparable to or better than Shapley-value-based methods against label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies validate key design choices.

Conclusion: FedIF is a practical, theoretically grounded, and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and robust FL in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

*Amir Moeini,Minjae Kwon,Alper Kamil Bozkurt,Yuichi Motai,Rohan Chandra,Lu Feng,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A safety-aware in-context RL (ICRL) method for constrained MDPs that enables parameter-update-free adaptation by jointly optimizing reward and a cost, with a budget that scales from conservative to aggressive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL grows input context over time during adaptation, but safety guarantees are lacking during this update-free phase. A principled framework is needed to constrain safety-related costs while enabling adaptation.

Method: Introduce a constrained-MDP-aware adaptation mechanism operating during parameter-update-free ICRL. The agent minimizes a cost function in addition to reward and responds to a cost-budget threshold, enabling budget-controlled adaptation as the context expands.

Result: Empirical findings show the agent's behavior is modulated by the cost budget: higher budgets yield more aggressive behavior while lower budgets yield conservatism, demonstrating effective safety control during adaptation.

Conclusion: Safety-aware ICRL within a constrained-MDP framework is feasible; the cost budget provides a tunable mechanism to trade off safety and performance during parameter-free adaptation.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

TL;DR: A survey of ML and RL-enhanced black-box optimization, outlining how ML surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning, and RL-based control advance derivative-free methods; covers algorithms and benchmarks and concludes that ML/RL yield more scalable, robust, and adaptive BBO frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box optimization problems involve costly queries, no gradients, and often high dimensionality, noise, or mixed-integer structure. Classical derivative-free methods struggle under these conditions, motivating ML/RL-driven approaches that learn surrogates, adapt operators, and enable cross-task transfer.

Method: Survey of representative algorithms and frameworks (e.g., mlrMBO, ZO-AdaMM, ABBO, DiBB, SPBOpt, B2Opt, diffusion-model-based BBO, Surr-RLDE, RBO, CAS-MORE, LB-SGD, PIBB, Q-Mamba) and benchmarks (NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge, MetaBox), presenting a taxonomy and synthesis of design patterns and performance implications.

Result: Provides a cohesive taxonomy and synthesis of ML/RL-enhanced BBO methods, highlighting how ML surrogates, meta-learning, and RL-based configuration improve scalability, robustness, and adaptability; identifies common strategies and where gains are realized across problem classes and tasks.

Conclusion: ML and RL are transforming classical inexact solvers into scalable, robust, and adaptive BBO frameworks for real-world optimization; future work should address benchmarking, theoretical guarantees, scalability to high dimensions, and cross-domain meta-learning.

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

TL;DR: Binarising sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs) improves interpretability and monosemanticity but raises reconstruction error and ultra-high-frequency uninterpretable features; when interpretability is frequency-adjusted, continuous sparse coders can be slightly more interpretable, implying polysemanticity may be intrinsic to neural activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of features learned by sparse autoencoders by removing the continuum of activation strengths that can carry subtle, potentially uninterpretable information.

Method: Propose and evaluate binary sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs) that constrain all activations to 0 or 1. Compare interpretability, monosemanticity, and reconstruction error against standard (continuous) sparse coders. Analyze the impact of frequency on interpretability scores.

Result: Binarisation substantially boosts interpretability and monosemanticity, at the cost of higher reconstruction error. It removes the ladder of activation strengths, preventing smuggling of uninterpretable information via continuous variation. However, binary methods introduce more ultra-high-frequency, uninterpretable features. When interpretability is adjusted for frequency, continuous sparse coders slightly outperform binary ones, suggesting polysemanticity may be intrinsic to neural activations.

Conclusion: Binarising activations yields interpretable, monosemantic features but trades off reconstruction accuracy and can increase ultra-high-frequency noise; interpretability depends on frequency adjustments, indicating polysemanticity may be an inescapable aspect of neural representations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

### [363] [Effective Model Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25606)
*Yixuan Wang,Dan Guralnik,Saiedeh Akbari,Warren Dixon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal, parameter-free pruning rule (EMP) that maps any score vector to an effective number N_eff via an inverse Simpson index, keeps the top N_eff entries, and achieves sparse models with performance comparable to dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN. A default scaling eta=1 is robust, with eta adjustable for targeted sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning revolves around a core question: how many entries should be kept? The method seeks a context-agnostic, criterion-agnostic threshold that can be applied to any scoring signal (weights, attention, KAN, pixels) and across model families.

Method: Introduce EMP, which takes a score vector s and maps it to an effective number N_eff inspired by the inverse Simpson index. Retain the N_eff highest-scoring entries and zero the rest. Derive a tight lower bound on the preserved mass s_eff using the geometry of the ordered probability simplex. Validate by pruning with a scaled threshold eta * N_eff across diverse criteria and models.

Result: Sparse models produced by keeping N_eff entries achieve performance close to the original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN. The default eta = 1 yields a robust pruning threshold; other eta values can adjust sparsity as needed.

Conclusion: EMP provides a universal, parameter-free pruning framework with a principled threshold based on N_eff. It generalizes across pruning criteria and model architectures and shows robust empirical performance.

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

*Muhammad Imran Hossain,Jignesh Solanki,Sarika Khushlani Solanki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces T-BiGAN, a window-attention Transformer-based BiGAN for unsupervised real-time anomaly detection in synchrophasor (PMU) data, achieving high detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure timely, unsupervised detection of anomalies in PMU data streams to enhance power grid resilience, addressing scarcity of labeled fault data and the need for real-time wide-area monitoring.

Method: Incorporates window-attention Transformers inside a bidirectional GAN. A self-attention encoder-decoder captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies; a joint discriminator enforces cycle consistency between latent space and data distribution. Anomaly scores combine reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence for real-time detection.

Result: Evaluated on a hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark: ROC-AUC 0.95 and average precision 0.996, outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. Exceptional at detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations in live monitoring.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical viability of unsupervised, real-time PMU anomaly detection with strong performance and no need for fault-labeled data; architecture likely generalizes to other time-series in cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

### [365] [Layer-wise dynamic rank for compressing large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25622)
*Zhendong Mi,Bian Sun,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Rank introduces layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for SVD-based LLM compression, using effective rank and a Lagrange multiplier optimization to allocate more capacity to information-dense layers, improving performance and throughput under fixed compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory and compute bottlenecks in large language models by moving beyond uniform per-layer compression. Intra-layer heterogeneity exists, with middle layers carrying richer information while early/late layers are more redundant; adaptive, information-aware compression may preserve performance under resource constraints.

Method: 1) Propose effective rank as a metric for information density of weight matrices. 2) Allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization to satisfy a fixed total compression, biasing toward denser groups. 3) Rebalance allocated ranks across attention layers to reflect varying importance. 4) Extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. 5) Empirically validate across multiple models and compression ratios.

Result: D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing. For example, it achieves more than 15% lower perplexity on LLaMA-3-8B with 20% compression on C4, and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy on LLaMA-7B with 40% compression, while also delivering higher throughput.

Conclusion: Layer-wise dynamic rank allocation effectively preserves information-rich regions while pruning redundant capacity, enabling better performance and efficiency for SVD-based LLM compression across model scales and attention variants.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

### [366] [Swift: An Autoregressive Consistency Model for Efficient Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25631)
*Jason Stock,Troy Arcomano,Rao Kotamarthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Swift is a single-step consistency model that autoregressively finetunes a probability-flow model with a CRPS objective, enabling fast, stable 6-hourly probabilistic forecasts for subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales (up to ~75 days). It achieves ~39x speedups over diffusion baselines and competitive skill with the operational IFS ENS, reducing reliance on ensembles and parameter perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide physically grounded probabilistic weather forecasts but are hampered by slow, iterative solvers during inference, limiting practicality for S2S which require long lead-times and careful calibration. There is a need for fast, reliable ensemble forecasting that scales from medium-range to seasonal horizons without extensive multi-model perturbations.

Method: Introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability-flow model using a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This approach removes the need for multi-model ensembles or parameter perturbations, and performs inference in a single step rather than iterative sampling typical of diffusion models. Trains the model with CRPS to optimize probabilistic forecast calibration.

Result: Swift yields skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75 days and runs ~39 times faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Forecast skill is competitive with the numerical-based operational IFS ENS, suggesting effective performance on S2S scales while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that a single-step consistency framework with autoregressive CRPS training can deliver fast, calibrated probabilistic forecasts at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales, offering an efficient replacement or complement to diffusion-based ensembles for operational forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

### [367] [How Does Preconditioning Guide Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25637)
*Kotaro Yoshida,Atsushi Nitanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Preconditioning shapes feature learning via a Gram-matrix–defined spectral bias; aligning this bias with the teacher's spectrum improves generalization and transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how preconditioning affects the expected risk and the spectral properties of learned representations, beyond improvements on the empirical risk.

Method: Theoretical analysis in a single-index teacher model, treating the preconditioner as the p-th power of the input covariance. The study analyzes how the exponent p and the alignment between teacher and input spectrum influence generalization, and examines implications for robustness to noise, out-of-distribution generalization, and forward knowledge transfer.

Result: Generalization depends on the exponent p and the alignment between the teacher and input spectra. The learned features mirror the spectral bias induced by the preconditioner, emphasizing components that are amplified and suppressing others. When the spectral bias is aligned with the teacher, generalization improves significantly.

Conclusion: Preconditioning can steer feature learning through spectral bias, and proper alignment with the teacher's spectrum yields notable generalization gains, offering a principled way to design preconditioners for better performance.

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

### [368] [Deep set based operator learning with uncertainty quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25646)
*Lei Ma,Ling Guo,Hao Wu,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UQ-SONet: a permutation-invariant operator learning framework with built-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) that handles sparse/variable sensor data using a set-transformer embedding and a conditional VAE to model the solution operator's distribution; demonstrates robust performance on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including Navier–Stokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current operator learning methods (e.g., DeepONets, VIDON) rely on fixed sensor configurations and lack principled uncertainty quantification, limiting applicability to incomplete measurements or inherently random operators.

Method: Use a set-transformer embedding to handle sparse, variable sensor locations and a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of the solution operator; train by maximizing the evidence lower bound (minimizing negative ELBO).

Result: The framework provides principled UQ with maintained predictive accuracy, showing robust performance on both deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including Navier–Stokes.

Conclusion: UQ-SONet advances operator learning by enabling permutation-invariant handling of variable sensors with built-in uncertainty quantification, broadening practical applicability to uncertain or incomplete measurement scenarios.

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: BaB-prob extends branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting to probabilistic neural network verification, using linear bound propagation to bound probabilities; provides soundness and completeness proofs for feedforward-ReLU networks; introduces an uncertainty level and two strategies (BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob); achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, untrained networks, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend effective deterministic verification (branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting) to probabilistic neural networks, enabling reliable probabilistic guarantees in higher-dimensional settings.

Method: BaB-prob iteratively splits preactivations to create subproblems; uses linear bound propagation to bound probabilities for each subproblem; proves soundness and completeness for feedforward-ReLU networks; introduces an uncertainty level and two strategies: BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows BaB-prob consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on medium- to high-dimensional inputs across untrained networks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaB-prob is an effective framework for probabilistic verification of neural networks, with theoretical guarantees and practical strategies yielding strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

### [370] [Growing Winning Subnetworks, Not Pruning Them: A Paradigm for Density Discovery in Sparse Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25665)
*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR is a growth-based sparse-to-dense training method that automatically discovers operating density and approaches lottery-ticket performance with lower training cost by greedily adding edges guided by path-based scores and a logistic stopping rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning-based or fixed-density sparsity methods often incur heavy retraining costs or require pre-specifying the target density. A constructive, growth-driven approach could dynamically find an effective sparsity level while potentially reducing training cost.

Method: Initialize from a sparse seed; iteratively add edges. Selection is guided by Path Weight Magnitude Product–biased, path-kernel-inspired scores, with randomization to mitigate bottlenecks; stop growing when a logistic-fit rule detects plateau in accuracy.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show PWMPR achieving performance close to IMP-derived lottery tickets, albeit at a higher density, with substantially lower cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3–4x for IMP).

Conclusion: Growth-based density discovery is a promising complementary paradigm to pruning and dynamic sparsity, enabling automatic density discovery and cost-efficient, competitive performance.

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

*Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Becky Xiangyu Peng,Prafulla Kumar Choubey,Kung-Hsiang Huang,Jiaxin Zhang,Mohit Bansal,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NuRL introduces a self-generated hinting framework to unlock learning from hard samples in online RL for LLM reasoning. By injecting abstract, self-generated hints only for unsolvable cases, it raises the model’s upper bound beyond GRPO and yields consistent gains across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional online RL (e.g., GRPO) cannot learn from unsolvable problems because there are no rewarding rollouts, leaving the model’s upper performance limit unchanged. There is a need for signals from hard samples to push the upper bound.

Method: 1) The model first produces a chain-of-thought (CoT) and a self-generated hint that encapsulates core knowledge. 2) Generate G rollouts using the base policy and compute the pass rate. 3) If a hard sample has 0% pass rate, inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. 4) Hints are abstract, high-level, and self-generated to avoid distributional shift. 5) Systematically study what makes effective hints and when they’re most useful, noting hints are best after GRPO converges.

Result: NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models and can raise the model’s upper limit, unlike GRPO whose pass@1024 remains unchanged. Hints help convert unsolvable samples into solvable ones, enabling training signals where none existed before.

Conclusion: NuRL unlocks learning from hard samples by using self-generated, abstract hints to raise the upper bound of LLM reasoning. The hints are most effective when abstract and applied after GRPO convergence, and they avoid distributional shift since they are generated within the model.

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

*Xing Han,Hsing-Huan Chung,Joydeep Ghosh,Paul Pu Liang,Suchi Saria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a temporal multimodal interaction-aware router for MoE that routes tokens to experts based on learned, time-varying modality interactions, improving generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE routing commonly ignores dynamic inter-modal relationships, which limits expert specialization and reasoning. Quantified temporal interactions can guide more generalizable interaction-processing skills.

Method: Proposes a framework that defines and leverages temporal multimodal interaction dynamics to guide routing. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts according to the interaction nature, using a new formulation of temporal interactions to reveal patterns across applications.

Result: Empirical evaluations on challenging multimodal benchmarks show enhanced performance and improved interpretability, supporting both the effectiveness of the routing approach and the usefulness of the interaction dynamics.

Conclusion: Temporal interaction-guided routing enables MoE models to specialize in interaction processing, improving performance and insights, and informing MoE design for multimodal settings.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

### [374] [Minimalist Explanation Generation and Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25686)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes activation-matching to generate minimal, faithful explanations for image classifiers by learning binary masks via a lightweight autoencoder; aligns activations across layers, enforces sparsity/compactness, and uses a circuit readout to connect explanations to internal network components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional inputs give many possible decision rules, making interpretation hard. The goal is to produce explanations that are both concise and faithful to the model's decision, and to gain mechanistic insight into internal computations.

Method: 1) Train a lightweight autoencoder to produce binary masks highlighting decision-critical regions while suppressing background. 2) Optimize with activation alignment across multiple layers, output-label consistency, sparsity and compactness priors, plus a robustness constraint to enforce faithfulness. 3) Introduce a circuit readout: using the explanation’s forward pass and gradients to identify active channels, build a channel-level graph, and score inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.

Result: The method yields minimal explanations that preserve the model’s decision and are human-readable, and enables a mechanistic interpretation of the model internals through the circuit readout that connects input explanations to internal components.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical bridge between minimal input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal computations driving model decisions.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

### [375] [A Unified Probabilistic Framework for Dictionary Learning with Parsimonious Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25690)
*Zihui Zhao,Yuanbo Tang,Jieyu Ren,Xiaoping Zhang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A row-wise L_infty penalty on the coefficient matrix promotes entire dictionary atoms to be inactive, yielding a more parsimonious dictionary with better reconstruction. Grounded in Beta-Bernoulli priors, it offers a Bayesian interpretation, theoretical hyperparameter guidance, and connections to MDL and pathlet learning; empirically yields ~20% RMSE reduction and uses <10% of atoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional L1 sparsity focuses on per-sample sparsity and neglects how atoms are shared across samples, leading to redundant dictionaries. The proposed approach seeks to reduce active atoms across the dataset by turning off entire rows of the coefficient matrix, thereby achieving more compact representations.

Method: Introduce a row-wise L_infty norm penalty on the coefficient matrix in dictionary learning. Derived from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the regularization. Establish theoretical criteria for optimal hyperparameter selection and connect the formulation to Minimum Description Length (MDL), Bayesian model selection, and pathlet learning.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantially improved reconstruction quality (about a 20% RMSE reduction) and enhanced sparsity, with the model using fewer than one-tenth of the available dictionary atoms. Empirical results support the theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: A parsimony-promoting dictionary learning framework effectively reduces redundancy by constraining active atoms across samples. The Beta-Bernoulli probabilistic basis offers a solid Bayesian interpretation and links to MDL and pathlet learning, with strong empirical gains in reconstruction and sparsity.

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

### [376] [Annotation-Efficient Active Test-Time Adaptation with Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25692)
*Tingyu Shi,Fan Lyu,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPATTA introduces principled, coverage-guaranteed uncertainty via conformal prediction into Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA). It uses smoothed conformal scores with a top-K certainty measure, an online weight-update driven by pseudo coverage, a domain-shift detector to adapt supervision, and a staged update scheme to balance labeled and unlabeled data, achieving ~5% higher accuracy than prior ATTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ATTA methods rely on heuristic uncertainty measures for selective labeling, which leads to inefficient use of the annotation budget and suboptimal adaptation under domain shift. There is a need for principled, coverage-guaranteed uncertainty estimates to improve data efficiency and robustness at deployment.

Method: Introduce smoothed conformal scores with a top-K certainty measure to quantify uncertainty; an online weight-update mechanism driven by pseudo-coverage to adaptively select instances for labeling; a domain-shift detector that modulates supervision; a staged update schedule to balance human-labeled and model-labeled data; implementation and experiments demonstrating improved performance.

Result: CPATTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ATTA methods by around 5% in accuracy across experiments, demonstrating better data efficiency and robustness under domain shift; code and datasets are publicly available.

Conclusion: By integrating conformal prediction with active test-time adaptation, CPATTA provides principled uncertainty with coverage guarantees, leading to more efficient use of labeling budget and improved accuracy under domain shifts.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

### [377] [Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25696)
*Takuya Fujimura,Kota Dohi,Natsuo Yamashita,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training time-series QA models with VLM-generated pseudo labels can outperform the VLM itself by leveraging unlabeled data despite noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSQA labels are scarce; VLMs offer zero-shot analysis but have limitations. The work seeks to exploit unlabeled data by using VLMs to generate pseudo labels.

Method: Generate pseudo labels for TSQA data using a vision-language model, then train TSQA models on these noisy labels. The approach relies on the robustness of deep networks to label noise and utilizes large-scale unlabeled data.

Result: TSQA models trained on pseudo labels can surpass the VLM's performance, demonstrating that leveraging unlabeled data with noisy pseudo labels is effective.

Conclusion: Noisy pseudo labeling via VLMs, combined with abundant unlabeled data, is a viable strategy for TSQA, highlighting deep networks’ resilience to label noise and the potential to exceed zero-shot VLM performance.

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

*Cheng Guo,Giuseppe L'Erario,Giulio Romualdi,Mattia Leonori,Marta Lorenzini,Arash Ajoudani,Daniele Pucci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed learning framework uses 5 IMUs to predict physically plausible human motion, incorporating forward and differential kinematics into training losses and iterative inference with a joint state buffer, achieving accurate, smooth predictions that generalize to unseen subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate, physically feasible real-time human motion prediction under limited sensor availability, addressing reliance on past poses and lack of physical constraints in existing methods.

Method: A neural network that captures spatial motion patterns; training adds forward and differential kinematics losses; inference uses iterative refinement updating a joint state buffer and injecting it as input, using 5-IMU data.

Result: High accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and good generalization to unseen subjects.

Conclusion: The physics-informed framework effectively fuses domain knowledge with learning to produce accurate, physically plausible motion predictions from sparse IMU data, benefiting human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

### [379] [Adaptive Graph Coarsening for Efficient GNN Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25706)
*Rostyslav Olshevskyi,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jointly train GNNs with adaptive graph coarsening by K-means clustering to merge nodes during training, enabling scalable learning on large and heterophilic graphs while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability challenge of large real-world graphs and preserve performance by reducing data during training without a fixed preprocessing step.

Method: Simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen the graph by partitioning nodes into K clusters via K-means on their embeddings; merge nodes within clusters during training; clusters adapt to the learning task (including heterophily) rather than relying solely on connectivity/features.

Result: Validated on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets; demonstrates that coarsening adapts to the learning task; visualizations show alignment between embeddings and cluster assignments.

Conclusion: Integrating coarsening into training yields scalable GNNs that can handle challenging data and heterogeneous relationships, with clusters that reflect task-driven structure.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

### [380] [Expert Merging: Model Merging with Unsupervised Expert Alignment and Importance-Guided Layer Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25712)
*Dengming Zhang,Xiaowen Ma,Zhenliang Ni,Zhenkai Wu,Han Shu,Xin Jiang,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-light expert merging method that learns layer-wise coefficients to merge multiple domain-specific experts into LLMs/MLLMs, with an extension (Expert Merging++) that uses importance-guided chunking to allocate coefficients to high-impact layers. It surpasses several baselines and can even match supervised mixture training in some cases, with code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free merging relies on hand-tuned coefficients, while training-based merging often aligns parameters only and treats all layers uniformly, ignoring inter-layer variation. There is a need for a scalable, label-free, and parameter-efficient method that accounts for layer heterogeneity when merging multiple experts into large models.

Method: Introduce Expert Merging, which learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using unlabeled calibration data to align the merged model’s hidden states and logits with those of the experts. Regularization on coefficients improves stability and task-weighted losses balance trade-offs. Expert Merging++ adds importance-guided chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, to allocate more coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance layers lightweight. Evaluated across MLLMs (InternVL, Qwen2-VL) and LLM (Mistral), outperforming strong baselines; in some cases surpassing supervised Mixture Training.

Result: The method achieves superior performance relative to strong training-free and training-based baselines across multiple backbones, with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and occasionally exceeding supervised Mixture Training.

Conclusion: A label-free, parameter-efficient, and scalable approach to multi-expert model merging that accounts for inter-layer heterogeneity. By learning layer-wise coefficients and employing chunking, Expert Merging provides robust performance gains across LLMs and MLLMs and can rival or exceed some supervised alternatives, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

*Hyunsoo Song,Minjung Gim,Jaewoong Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unbalanced OT reweighted flow matching (UOT-RFM) for long-tailed distributions; uses mini-batch Unbalanced OT to form conditional vector fields and inverse reweighting via a label-free majority score, enabling distribution recovery and improved tail generation without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle majority bias in flow matching on imbalanced data and enable accurate minority-mode generation without relying on class labels.

Method: Construct conditional vector fields from mini-batch UOT; compute a density-ratio-based majority score (target density / UOT marginal); apply inverse reweighting in training to correct for class imbalance; first-order theory guarantees recovery; higher-order corrections improve tail fidelity.

Result: Outperforms flow-matching baselines on long-tailed benchmarks; remains competitive on balanced datasets; empirical gain grows with higher-order corrections; theoretical justification for k=1 recovery.

Conclusion: UOT-RFM provides a principled, label-free framework to address long-tailed generative modeling via UOT-based reweighting, mitigating majority bias and enhancing tail-class generation with both theory and experiments.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

*Hanghui Guo,Shimin Di,Pasquale De Meo,Zhangze Chen,Jia Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuPlon introduces a dual causal intervention framework to improve claim verification on Claim-Evidence Graphs by addressing data noise and biases via back-door and front-door strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fully connected C-E graphs suffer from noise and biases due to complex evidence interactions, leading to unreliable verification.

Method: Back-door: dilute noisy node interference by learning node probability weights and strengthen connections among relevant evidence. Front-door: extract highly relevant subgraphs to form reasoning paths and apply counterfactual reasoning to remove biases.

Result: MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on claim verification tasks.

Conclusion: Dual-path causal interventions effectively mitigate noise and biases in C-E graphs, enhancing verification reliability.

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC-CLE: a Monte Carlo-based posterior localization method that trains a neural scoring network to discriminate true vs candidate transmitter locations, capturing angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns in LOS multi-antenna settings; outperforms uniform baselines and Gaussian posteriors in cross-entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorporating quantified uncertainty in localization is essential for planning, control, and radio resource management; point estimates lack calibration. The method aims to learn a probabilistic posterior over transmitter locations from measurements, capturing key structural properties of the wireless channel.

Method: Monte Carlo Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE): train a neural scoring network using Monte Carlo samples to compare true transmitter locations against candidate locations, enabling posterior inference. Evaluation in LOS simulations with a multi-antenna receiver to recover properties like angular ambiguity and front-to-back patterns.

Result: MC-CLE learns critical spatial properties (angular ambiguity, front-to-back antenna patterns) and achieves lower cross-entropy loss than a uniform baseline and Gaussian posterior approximations (or alternatives under a uniform-loss metric).

Conclusion: MC-CLE provides an effective, uncertainty-aware localization framework that leverages Monte Carlo sampling and neural scoring to approximate posteriors, outperforming simple baselines in LOS multi-antenna settings and capturing key geometrical/antenna-channel structures.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also
quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource
management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown
transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo
Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network
using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations.
We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE
learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back
antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

*Indu Kant Deo,Akash Venkateshwaran,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-guided probabilistic framework using variational Gaussian processes and neural encoders to predict 3D transmission loss in ocean acoustics with calibrated uncertainty, demonstrated on Salish Sea data and used for ship-speed optimization to mitigate noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater noise from shipping is rising and threatens marine life; real-time, uncertainty-aware digital twins of ocean acoustics are needed to support sustainable maritime operations and noise mitigation.

Method: Dataset of >30 million source–receiver pairs generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound-speed profiles and 12.5 Hz–8 kHz bands. Methods include sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP), physics-based mean functions (spherical spreading + frequency-dependent absorption), deep sigma-point processes, and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The framework has four components: (i) learnable physics-informed mean; (ii) bathymetry encoder along the source–receiver track; (iii) neural encoder for source, receiver, and frequency coordinates; (iv) residual SVGP providing calibrated predictive uncertainty.

Result: The approach yields calibrated predictions with uncertainty bounds for transmission loss, enabling sound-exposure bounds and worst-case scenarios. It supports applications like ship-speed optimization by combining TL predictions with near-field source models to estimate sound exposure levels for marine-mammal protection.

Conclusion: This work advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics by illustrating how physics-guided ML can support sustainable maritime operations through improved TL prediction and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

*Yanan Zhao,Feng Ji,Jingyang Dai,Jiaze Ma,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, augmentation-free GCL framework that combines graph topology-derived structural features (via a GCN encoder) with node feature information (via an MLP) to handle heterophily, without negative sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results and robustness with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question whether complex augmentations, encoders, or negative sampling are necessary in GCL, especially on heterophilic graphs, and how to leverage the natural complementarity of structure and features.

Method: Two-branch model: a GCN encoder to extract structural features from graph topology and an MLP encoder to model and denoise node features; no data augmentation and no negative samples.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational/memory overhead; also beneficial for homophilic graphs; theoretical justification and extensive experiments including adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: Simple, principled GCL design leveraging dual views from structure and features suffices for effective graph representation learning across regimes, with scalability and robustness advantages.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

*Xiang Zhang,Kun Wei,Xu Yang,Chenghao Xu,Su Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU) to mitigate cumulative utility loss in continuous unlearning for LLMs by modeling unlearning as controlled rotation in a cognitive space, with skew-symmetric loss and orthogonal-axis regularization; achieves SOTA without retained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods rely on retained data and incur accumulating utility loss under repeated requests; there is a need for a dataset-free, interference-resistant approach that preserves utility while removing harmful data.

Method: RCU leverages a rotational salience weight to quantify unlearning; introduces a skew-symmetric loss to create a cognitive rotation space; uses regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation axes across successive unlearning requests, reducing interference.

Result: Empirical results on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art performance without retaining dataset, indicating effectiveness in continuous unlearning.

Conclusion: Rotation-based unlearning can effectively model and control the unlearning process, addressing cumulative interference and offering a practical, dataset-free solution for LLM security unlearning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

### [387] [OPPO: Accelerating PPO-based RLHF via Pipeline Overlap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25762)
*Kaizhuo Yan,Yingjie Yu,Yifan Yu,Haizhong Zheng,Fan Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPPO is a lightweight PPO-based RLHF framework that overlaps pipeline stages to speed up training and improve GPU utilization, while preserving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO-based RLHF suffers inefficiencies from sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g., reward model depends on actor outputs) and tail latency from long responses, leading to wasted compute and slow training.

Method: Introduce intra-step overlap (stream actor outputs in right-sized chunks so reward model can start early) and inter-step overlap (adaptive overcommitment of a few prompts and deferral of long generations to subsequent steps). The approach is model-agnostic and integrates with existing PPO implementations with minimal code changes.

Result: Training accelerates by approximately 1.8×–2.8× and GPU utilization improves by about 1.4×–2.1× without compromising convergence.

Conclusion: OPPO provides a simple, effective, and model-agnostic optimization for PPO-based RLHF that mitigates sequential bottlenecks and tail latency, enabling faster RLHF training with minimal engineering effort.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4

### [388] [Autonomy-Aware Clustering: When Local Decisions Supersede Global Prescriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25775)
*Amber Srivastava,Salar Basiri,Srinivasa Salapaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autonomy-aware clustering uses reinforcement learning with deterministic annealing and an adaptive distance estimator to model and exploit local autonomy in clustering, achieving closer-to-ground-truth clusters than autonomy-agnostic methods (gap ~3-4% vs ~35-40%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many clustering tasks, entities are not strictly passive and may override prescribed groupings. Traditional clustering assumes fixed associations and can mislead downstream inference when autonomy alters cluster structure. The work motivates accounting for local autonomy without requiring explicit autonomy models.

Method: Integrates reinforcement learning with a deterministic annealing process to discover underlying clusters. Introduces Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives, works with variable-sized inputs/outputs, and enables knowledge transfer. Phase-transition analysis suggests efficient annealing schedules. The framework learns from data without requiring a predefined autonomy form.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the approach yields cluster solutions closely aligned with ground truth (gap about 3–4%), whereas ignoring autonomy results in substantially larger gaps (about 35–40%). Code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: Autonomy-aware clustering offers a robust framework for clustering under local autonomy, with RL+DA+ADEN enabling adaptability and transferability across problem instances; it demonstrates significant performance improvements and provides accessible code for replication.

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

*Jianyu Xu,Vidhi Jain,Bryan Wilder,Aarti Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Doubly-optimistic online learner expands its action space by paying a one-time cost to create actions, achieving sublinear regret and better generation-quality tradeoffs in healthcare QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI enables dynamic action creation, but costs and the need to balance exploitation, exploration, and creation make online decision-making with expanding action spaces challenging.

Method: Propose a doubly-optimistic algorithm using Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action creation; actions are incrementally created at a cost and persist; analyze regret.

Result: Theoretical regret bound of O(T^{d/(d+2)} d^{d/(d+2)} + d sqrt(T log T)) and first sublinear regret for expanding action spaces; empirical results on healthcare QA datasets show favorable generation-quality tradeoffs vs baselines.

Conclusion: This work establishes sublinear regret for online learning with action creation and demonstrates practical benefits in generation quality for decision-making agents.

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

*Prosper Rosaire Mama Assandje,Teumsa Aboubakar,Dongho Joseph,Takemi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometry-driven neural network on the lognormal manifold is constructed using Hamiltonian dynamics, with SU(1,1) symmetries guiding weights and activations, yielding an interpretable, manifold-aware architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge information geometry and machine learning by building neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds, enabling principled, geometry-guided design and interpretability in learning systems.

Method: Formulate a neural network on the lognormal statistical manifold via a Hamiltonian system equivalent to gradient flow. Use coordinates from Hamiltonian dynamics in the Poincaré disk. Decompose weights: rotation via SU(1,1) action on the disk; activation from the system's symplectic structure. Derive the full weight matrix (including translation) and outputs.

Result: A complete neural network architecture that lives on the lognormal manifold, with geometry dictating the network's structure and parameters, demonstrating feasibility and interpretability of manifold-based learning.

Conclusion: The lognormal manifold can be treated as a neural manifold, where differential-geometric structure prescribes a unique, interpretable network architecture, signaling a new paradigm for geometry-grounded learning systems.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

*Zhizhou Zhang,Youjia Wu,Kaixuan Zhang,Yanjia Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage, physics-agnostic pretraining improves PDE operator learning: pretrain a geometry autoencoder on point clouds, then train a transformer-based neural operator on PDE solutions using latent embeddings, yielding better data efficiency and accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDE simulations are costly; labeled PDE data are scarce; abundant geometry-only designs exist but underutilized. A physics-agnostic pretraining step could yield representations that improve learning with limited labels.

Method: Stage 1: train an autoencoder (geometry reconstruction) on geometry-only data to learn latent representations. Stage 2: train a neural operator to predict PDE solutions using the pretrained latent embeddings as inputs; use transformer architectures for both stages; evaluate across four PDE datasets and three transformer-based operators.

Result: The approach consistently improves PDE solvers' accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point clouds, demonstrating data-efficient operator learning.

Conclusion: Physics-agnostic pretraining provides a powerful foundation for data-efficient operator learning in PDE contexts.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

*Gongxu Luo,Loka Li,Guangyi Chen,Haoyue Dai,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel causal discovery framework that accounts for post-treatment selection and latent confounding, introducing FI-Markov equivalence and F-PAG diagram, and F-FCI algorithm to recover causal structure using observational and interventional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the overlooked problem of post-treatment selection in interventional causal discovery, which can induce spurious dependencies and mask true causal relations, especially when quality control criteria filter samples.

Method: Proposes a new causal formulation incorporating post-treatment selection; defines FI-Markov equivalence; introduces F-PAG graphical diagram; develops F-FCI algorithm that is provably sound and complete for identifying causal relations, latent confounders, and selection up to FI-Markov equivalence using both observational and interventional data.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets show the method recovers causal relations despite presence of both selection and latent confounders; demonstrates the utility of FI-Markov equivalence and F-FCI.

Conclusion: Extends causal discovery beyond traditional equivalence classes by explicitly modeling post-treatment selection; enabling identification of underlying true causal structure even with selection and latent confounding.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An ensemble ML framework (CardioForest combined with XGBoost/LightGBM) for automatic WCT detection from ECG achieves high accuracy and transparency, using SHAP for explainability on MIMIC-IV data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve WCT detection accuracy in ECG while ensuring clinical interpretability, addressing high-stakes emergency diagnosis and the need for trustable AI in cardiology.

Method: Train/test an ensemble system comprising CardioForest (an optimized Random Forest) along with XGBoost and LightGBM on ECG data from the MIMIC-IV dataset. Evaluate using accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, RMSE, MAE; apply SHAP for feature importance analysis.

Result: CardioForest achieved test accuracy 94.95% and balanced accuracy 88.31%, with strong precision/recall. SHAP highlighted clinically relevant features (e.g., QRS duration), aligning with clinical intuition.

Conclusion: CardioForest provides accurate, interpretable WCT detection, offering trustworthy predictions to help cardiologists in timely, high-stakes decision-making; the approach supports clinical adoption through explainability.

Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based
framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT)
from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost
and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly
available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

*Yuheng Zhang,Wenlin Yao,Changlong Yu,Yao Liu,Qingyu Yin,Bing Yin,Hyokun Yun,Lihong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AR3PO is a sampling-efficient RLVR method for large language models that uses adaptive rollout and response reuse to address vanishing advantages in GRPO, achieving higher efficiency and competitive performance across model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO can suffer from vanishing advantages when all responses in a group receive identical rewards, reducing training signal and efficiency; there is a need for more sample-efficient RLVR methods for LLMs.

Method: Introduce two techniques: adaptive rollout (allocate more sampling to difficult prompts, fewer to easy ones) and response reuse (reuse previously generated correct responses as training signals). Compare AR3PO against GRPO and DAPO on benchmarks using 7B/8B and 32B base models across multiple prompts and datasets.

Result: AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or surpasses DAPO on 7B/8B models, with up to 4.2x rollout cost reduction. On 32B models, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Conclusion: AR3PO provides a more sample-efficient RLVR framework for LLMs, effectively mitigating vanishing advantage issues and delivering strong performance with reduced computation across different model scales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mid-training should focus on action abstractions; RA3 algorithm discovers temporally consistent latent action structures to enable efficient RL fine-tuning, yielding strong code-generation gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlock RL potential in LLMs by shaping a compact action subspace during mid-training to reduce value approximation error and improve online RL convergence; emphasize action abstractions and short horizons.

Method: Theoretical characterization of the useful action subspace that minimizes pruning-induced value error and online RL error; propose RA3 with sequential variational lower bound; iteratively uncover temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, then fine-tune on bootstrapped data.

Result: Shows pruning efficiency and RL convergence as determinants of mid-training effectiveness; effective when decision space is compact and horizon short; RA3 yields +8 on HumanEval and +4 on MBPP vs baselines; faster convergence and higher asymptotic RLVR performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mid-training should operate in action abstractions; RA3 provides a scalable, effective mid-training approach that improves RL-assisted code generation tasks and online RL performance.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized asynchronous MP-MAB algorithm with adaptive exploration-exploitation achieves near-optimal regret in fully asynchronous settings, handling dynamic player membership without a global clock; backed by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fully asynchronous, decentralized MP-MAB where there is no global clock. Key challenges are collision avoidance without time coordination and accurately detecting the number of players with low cost.

Method: Players alternate between exploration (uniformly pulling arms to reduce collisions) and exploitation; with a small probability, they continue exploiting arms currently used by others to detect departed players; no global time is assumed.

Result: Regret bound of O(sqrt(T log T) + log T / Δ^2); claimed to be the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in asynchronous decentralized settings; experiments validate robustness and applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper delivers a theoretically-grounded, decentralized, asynchronous MP-MAB solution that simultaneously mitigates collisions and detects dynamic membership, with empirical support; it paves the way for practical deployment in networks like cognitive radio and IoT.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kairos introduces adaptive dynamics in time-series foundation models via a dynamic patching tokenizer and instance-adaptive positional embeddings, trained on a massive PreSTS corpus, delivering strong zero-shot performance with far fewer parameters on GIFT-Eval and Time-Series-Library benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series exhibit heterogeneous information density and varying signal complexity over time. Fixed-tokenization and uniform temporal encodings fail to capture this variability, limiting zero-shot generalization and efficiency.

Method: A dynamic patching tokenizer that adaptively chooses tokenization granularity per instance, together with instance-adaptive positional embeddings. Inference uses a multi-patch prediction strategy. Pretraining on a large Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus (~300B time points). Evaluated on zero-shot benchmarks GIFT-Eval and Time-Series-Library.

Result: Kairos achieves superior performance with substantially fewer parameters than strong baselines, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Adaptive tokenization and instance-tailored positional encodings effectively address heterogeneous information density in time series, enabling efficient zero-shot generalization. Project page: https://foundation-model-research.github.io/Kairos

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

*Seong-Hyeon Hwang,Soyoung Choi,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR:  MIDAS is a data-centric augmentation strategy for multimodal models that creates misaligned cross-modal samples with semantic inconsistencies, labels them using unimodal confidence, and uses dynamic weighting (weak-modality and hard-sample weighting) to force learning from weaker signals and focus on challenging samples, improving performance on multimodal classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often over-rely on a dominant modality, leaving underutilized complementary modalities. Data-centric approaches for balancing modality usage are underexplored compared to changes in training objectives, motivating the proposed MIDAS method to encourage robust fusion and reduce modality imbalance.

Method: MIDAS generates misaligned samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information. Labels these samples using unimodal confidence scores. Introduces two weighting strategies: (1) weak-modality weighting, which upweights the least confident modality to ensure weaker modalities contribute to learning; (2) hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes misaligned samples whose features are more similar to aligned features, making them harder and improving discrimination.

Result: Experiments on multiple multimodal classification benchmarks show MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines in addressing modality imbalance and enhancing cross-modal learning.

Conclusion: Data-centric augmentation that creates semantically misaligned samples, combined with dynamic weighting strategies, helps multimodal models better utilize weaker modalities and distinguish between classes, addressing modality imbalance and improving generalization on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

*Yeongmin Kim,Donghyeok Shin,Mina Kang,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concrete Score Distillation (CSD) is proposed as a discrete score-matching KD objective that overcomes softmax smoothing and logit-shift limitations, enabling stable and scalable LLM distillation with mode-seeking and mode-covering variants, and shows superior fidelity-diversity trade-offs and complementary gains with on-policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD objectives rely on softmax, which smooths logit information, and direct logit distillation (DLD) neglects logit shift invariance. Additionally, discrete score-matching can be unstable and quadratically complex for autoregressive LLMs. There is a need for a KD objective that preserves logit structure, is stable, scalable, and effective for LLM distillation.

Method: Introduce Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that aligns relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and teacher with flexible weighting. It overcomes softmax-induced smoothing and logit-shift restriction, addresses training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete score-matching, and provides mode-seeking and mode-covering variants within an autoregressive LLM distillation framework.

Result: CSD consistently outperforms recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques. It is evaluated on GPT-2-1.5B, OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Conclusion: CSD is a scalable and effective KD objective for LLM distillation that overcomes key limitations of prior methods, offers flexible mode behaviors, and integrates well with existing distillation and on-policy approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes S^2FS, a spatially-aware separability-driven feature selection for fuzzy decision systems that uses a forward greedy search to maximize within-class compactness and between-class separation by combining scalar distances with spatial directional information, improving accuracy, clustering, and interpretability over eight state-of-the-art methods on ten real datasets.


<details>

Motivation: Existing feature selection methods either do not directly align with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances, which inadequately capture decision boundaries. The spatial distribution of instances may influence boundary clarity in fuzzy decision systems.

Method: Introduce S^2FS framework with a spatially-aware separability criterion that integrates within-class compactness and between-class separation using scalar distances and spatial directional information, optimized via a forward greedy feature selection strategy.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ten real-world datasets shows S^2FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in classification accuracy and clustering performance; selected features offer interpretable visualizations.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial directional information into separability-based feature selection improves alignment with learning performance and enhances boundary clarity and interpretability for fuzzy decision systems; S^2FS is effective across multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

### [401] [Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849)
*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive exploration budget allocation for LLM self-improvement via knapsack-inspired scheduling increases non-zero GRPO gradients and enables larger budgets for hard tasks, yielding gains on math reasoning with lower compute than uniform allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform exploration budgets produce edge cases where some tasks yield zero gradients, wasting compute. Need a principled method to allocate resources where learning is most impactful.

Method: Model exploration episodes as items with value (potential learning gain) and cost (compute). Derive an optimal allocation rule from knapsack theory that dynamically assigns budgets based on current learning status. Integrate with GRPO to shift resources toward tasks with the most learning potential.

Result: Increase in proportion of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Ability to use much larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) on hard tasks. Average math-reasoning benchmark gains of 2-4 points, up to 9 on select tasks. Achieving comparable performance with uniform allocation would require ~2x compute.

Conclusion: Budget-aware exploration acts as a 'free lunch', reallocating resources from saturated tasks to impactful ones, enabling stronger performance with less overall compute and suggesting broad applicability to RL-based LLM training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

*Animesh Jha,Harshit Gupta,Ananjan Nandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based data selection for fine-tuning LLMs under a budget can match or exceed full-data fine-tuning performance while reducing training time; uses an MDP reformulation and proxy-model rewards, tested on four datasets with a 5% data subset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs under a strict data budget is an intractable optimization problem; existing pretraining-oriented data selection methods do not transfer well to the fine-tuning setting. A tractable, learning-based approach is needed to pick data that maximizes downstream performance efficiently.

Method: Reformulate data selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train reinforcement learning (RL) agents with various algorithms to learn data-selection policies. The reward is based on an efficient, proxy-model signal. Evaluated on four datasets using a 5% subset selected by the RL approach.

Result: Across four datasets, training on the 5% subset selected by the RL method matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to 10.8 accuracy points, while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 2x.

Conclusion: RL-guided data selection is a promising direction for efficient and effective fine-tuning of LLMs, enabling strong downstream performance with far less training data and time.

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

*Xinyu Zhang,Aishik Deb,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExploRLer enriches on-policy RL (PPO/TRPO) by exploring nearby regions of the parameter space around surrogate gradient updates, via a pluggable pipeline, improving performance without extra gradient steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate policy gradients often poorly correlate with the true reward landscape; the gradient direction may miss high-reward regions. Visualizing policy-space around checkpoints shows that better solutions lie in nearby, unexplored areas.

Method: Introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that systematically probes unexplored neighborhoods during iteration and integrates with on-policy algorithms, boosting policy performance without increasing gradient-update counts.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over baselines in complex continuous control tasks, demonstrating that iteration-level exploration strengthens on-policy RL and highlights limits of surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: Iteration-level exploration provides a practical, effective means to augment on-policy RL; ExploRLer is a versatile add-on that leverages local structure to find better policies without additional gradient steps.

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

*Yiwei Li,Shuai Wang,Zhuojun Tian,Xiuhua Wang,Shijian Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Split-model FL with privacy amplification: private submodels stay local, public submodels receive DP noise; random participation and data subsampling amplify privacy, improving the privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differential privacy in federated learning protects client data but introduces noise that harms accuracy. The challenge is to maintain high utility under strong privacy guarantees.

Method: Introduce MS-PAFL: partition each client's model into a private local submodel and a public submodel shared for aggregation; add calibrated Gaussian noise only to the public submodel; provide theoretical analysis of privacy amplification from random client participation and local subsampling; derive bounds on single-round and total privacy loss; validate with experiments.

Result: MS-PAFL achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off by reducing the required DP noise, enabling highly accurate models under strong privacy guarantees across experiments.

Conclusion: Structural model splitting coupled with participation-based privacy amplification effectively reduces DP noise needs in FL, offering a practical path to train high-utility models under stringent privacy constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theory-backed LTSF approach that combines AR and DO via Boosted Direct Output (BDO), stabilizes learning, enabling a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art results while validating a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural forecasters overemphasize architectural complexity, neglecting fundamental forecasting principles; a theoretical and principled approach is needed for long-term time series forecasting.

Method: Introduce a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem; propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO) that synergistically blends Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO); employ smooth parameter-tracking to stabilize learning; demonstrate with simple MLPs and extensive experiments, without area-specific tweaks.

Result: BDO with stabilized learning achieves state-of-the-art performance across many long-term forecasting benchmarks, outperforming recent complex models; the theory is empirically verified, including a dynamic performance bound.

Conclusion: A principled, simple architecture can rival complex models in LTSF; the framework provides theoretical grounding and directions for future research; code is available for review.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLGNs can scale to large multi-class tasks (up to 2000 classes) with proper temperature tuning and a Group-Sum output strategy; demonstrated via synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting output-layer design for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited scalability of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) and the underexplored design of their output layer, by testing expressiveness and performance on large-class problems.

Method: Empirical study using synthetic and real-world datasets to test alternative output strategies, with a focus on temperature tuning and the Group-Sum layer’s applicability to up to 2000 classes.

Result: Temperature tuning significantly influences output-layer performance; identified conditions under which the Group-Sum layer is effective for large-scale classification; demonstrated potential scalability up to 2000 classes.

Conclusion: DLGNs can be viable for large-scale classification provided with appropriate output-layer design (notably temperature control and Group-Sum strategy), enabling scalability to thousands of classes.

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

TL;DR: A dynamic policy-based optimizer (AIM) mitigates gradient interference in multi-task molecular property learning, boosting data-efficient performance and providing a diagnostic policy matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Destructive gradient interference in multi-task learning, especially in data-scarce regimes typical of drug discovery; a robust, data-efficient optimizer is needed for multi-property molecular design.

Method: AIM learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient conflicts, trained jointly with the main network using an augmented objective with dense differentiable regularizers. The policy yields geometrically stable and dynamically efficient updates, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.

Result: AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over multi-task baselines on QM9 and targeted protein degraders benchmarks, with the largest gains in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: Adaptive optimizers like AIM can accelerate scientific discovery by delivering robust, data-efficient multi-property molecular design and offering a diagnostic tool (the learned policy matrix) for analyzing inter-task relationships.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

*Deniz Soysal,Xabier García-Andrade,Laura E. Rodriguez,Pablo Sobron,Laura M. Barge,Renaud Detry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compact 1D CNN framework for autonomous Raman spectroscopy that is baseline- and shift-robust, label-efficient, and quickly transferable to new minerals for low-footprint exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raman instruments on remote exploration platforms face fluorescence baselines, peak shifts, and sparse labels. A robust, efficient classifier is needed for autonomous interpretation.

Method: Evaluate 1D CNNs on curated RRUFF datasets; remove baseline correction and peak-picking; tune pooling to handle shifts up to 30 cm^-1; employ semi-supervised GANs and contrastive pretraining for label-efficient learning; freeze CNN backbone and retrain only the softmax for O(1) transfer; train on raw spectra and release data splits/scripts; compare with kNN/SVM and Siamese networks.

Result: CNNs outperform kNN/SVM on handcrafted features; pooling controls translational invariance with 30 cm^-1 range; semi-supervised/contrastive methods boost accuracy by up to 11% with 10% labels; backbone freezing enables fast transfer to unseen minerals, outperforming Siamese networks on constrained hardware.

Conclusion: A practical, low-footprint workflow for robust Raman classification in autonomous exploration, combining end-to-end training on raw spectra, tunable spectral invariance, semi-supervised learning, and lightweight adaptation for new targets.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

TL;DR: FedDCL enables data-free continual learning for the server in a model-heterogeneous federated setting by leveraging diffusion-model-derived prototypes to synthesize data, replay knowledge, and transfer information across heterogeneous clients, improving generalization under non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, catastrophic forgetting, and knowledge misalignment in federated learning while preserving privacy and avoiding data sharing.

Method: Use pre-trained diffusion models to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes; generate synthetic data for the current task; exemplar-free generative replay to retain knowledge from previous tasks; data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the server.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets show improved generalization and practicality of FedDCL in dynamic, heterogeneous FL settings.

Conclusion: FedDCL demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of data-free continual learning for the server in model-heterogeneous FL, enhancing adaptability and scalability under diverse data and model distributions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A PAC-Bayes bound for a smoothed Q-weighted majority vote classifier that provides a certified robustness radius, connects generalization to the weight spectral norm, and introduces a spectral regularizer to boost robustness with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in theoretical work on certified robustness for majority vote classifiers and how robustness interacts with generalization; a bound with a certified radius would unify robustness and generalization analysis under the PAC-Bayes framework.

Method: Derive a generalization error bound for the smoothed (inputs-noisy) Q-weighted majority vote classifier that includes a certified robust radius. Analyze the role of the weight spectral norm in both the bound and the radius, and propose a dimension-aware spectral regularizer in smooth training based on the spherical Gaussian input setting to enhance robustness.

Result: The bound holds for any data perturbation within the certified radius and attributes part of both generalization and robustness to weight spectral norm. A novel, inexpensive spectral regularizer is proposed and empirically validated to improve the smoothed majority vote classifier's robustness.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical guarantees for both certified robustness and generalization of smoothed majority vote under PAC-Bayes, and offers a practical spectral regularization technique with empirical support to boost robustness.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Mykola Bordyuh,Djork-Arné Clevert,Marco Bertolini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired Schrödinger bridge (QSBP) is formulated in a Lagrangian framework, introducing Bohm (quantum) potential to induce non-locality in stochastic dynamics. For Gaussian endpoints, closed-form solutions exist, yielding Gaussian processes with altered covariance. A Gaussian Mixture Model–based algorithm is developed and tested across diverse domains (biology, images, molecules, mean-field games).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich the Schrödinger bridge framework by incorporating quantum-like non-local dynamics via the Bohm potential, enabling potentially more expressive generative models while retaining tractable Gaussian solutions for end-point distributions.

Method: Derive QSBP from a Lagrangian formulation of dynamical optimal transport; obtain Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi equations; reveal the role of the Bohm potential; prove that Gaussian endpoints lead to Gaussian processes with modified covariance; develop a Gaussian Mixture Model–based algorithm leveraging these closed-form solutions.

Result: Exact closed-form solutions for QSBP between Gaussian distributions are derived; the process remains Gaussian but covariance evolution is altered by quantum effects; a practical algorithm based on Gaussian mixtures is proposed and validated on tasks including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation, and Mean-Field Games.

Conclusion: The QSBP extends classical Schrödinger bridge theory with quantum-inspired non-locality, preserving tractability in the Gaussian case and enabling a new generative modeling paradigm via Gaussian mixtures; this framework yields meaningful improvements across diverse applications and invites further exploration of quantum-like dynamics in stochastic modeling.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a fully differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured N:M sparsity, enabling joint optimization of sparsity patterns and weights to produce hardware-friendly sparse LLMs with strong performance and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transform large language models into hardware-friendly sparse patterns to reduce latency and memory during inference, addressing inefficiencies from dense models. Prior methods separate sparsity pattern search from weight optimization; CAST aims for seamless, fully continuous joint optimization with a path to the target sparsity format.

Method: CAST introduces three components: (1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware optimizer with adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification; (2) Weight Scaling to mitigate magnitude loss from decay while preserving sparsity; (3) Knowledge Distillation using the dense model as a self-teacher. It supports 2:4 sparsity and progressively transforms models from 125M to 13B params during training, enabling joint optimization of sparsity and weights.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources. On LLaMA2-7B with 2:4 sparsity, perplexity increases by only 0.09 and zero-shot accuracy improves by 0.36% relative to the dense model, using just 2% of original pretraining tokens. The work also derives an empirical scaling law to predict sparse model performance given adequate training resources, and demonstrates practical applicability under quantization and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CAST enables highly efficient sparse LLMs by integrating sparsity pattern learning, weight optimization, and knowledge distillation into a single differentiable framework. It yields near-dense performance with substantial resource savings, provides a scalable predictor of sparse model performance, and shows versatility under quantization and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Method: Introduce an informed asymmetric actor-critic framework that allows conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged signals without requiring the full state; prove that policy gradients remain unbiased; develop informativeness metrics using kernel methods and return prediction error; validate on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable environments.

Result: Better learning efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are available; maintains unbiased policy gradients; provides practical tools to evaluate the usefulness of training-time signals.

Conclusion: Full-state access is not necessary for effective asymmetric RL; the approach broadens design space and offers theoretical and practical guidance for leveraging privileged information during training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

### [414] [Indirect Attention: Turning Context Misalignment into a Feature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26015)
*Bissmella Bahaduri,Hicham Talaoubrid,Fangchen Feng,Zuheng Ming,Anissa Mokraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-modal keys/values in attention are prone to noise; a misalignment-induced structured noise can degrade performance beyond a threshold. Indirect Attention offers a robust alternative, inferring relevance without relying on perfectly aligned context, showing improvements on synthetic and real tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how standard attention behaves when keys and values originate from different modalities or sequences, identify the existence of a critical noise threshold in value features, and address misalignment as structured noise that can overwhelm traditional attention.

Method: 1) Analyze attention under noisy value features to determine a critical noise threshold for signal degradation. 2) Model context (key, value) misalignment as structured noise in value features. 3) Propose Indirect Attention that infers relevance indirectly in misaligned contexts. 4) Evaluate on synthetic tasks and real-world applications to compare performance.

Result: Identification of a critical noise threshold for value-feature noise in traditional attention; demonstration that misalignment-induced structured noise can exceed this threshold and degrade performance; Indirect Attention shows superior robustness to misalignment across tested tasks.

Conclusion: Misalignment between keys and values significantly challenges standard attention due to structured noise, but Indirect Attention provides a robust mechanism by inferring relevance indirectly, improving performance in cross-modality/cross-sequence scenarios.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

*Daphne Theodorakopoulos,Elisabeth Eberling,Miriam Bodenheimer,Sabine Loos,Frederic Stahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A domain-adapted NLP system (FITS) extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible NGO reports and scientific literature for fashion brands, with a dataset and interactive tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access to credible, interpretable sustainability data in fashion is limited and prone to misinformation; domain-specific NLP is needed to support decision-making and transparency.

Method: Develop FITS, a transformer-based pipeline using BERT-based models (including science/climate-pretrained variants); fine-tune on a curated SustainableTextileCorpus; apply a domain-specific classification schema; optimize hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization; provide an interactive search/interface; build SustainableTextileCorpus dataset.

Result: Two focus groups evaluated FITS for usability and content, showing value of domain-adapted NLP; dataset and methodology for updates; code available.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted NLP can enhance access to credible sustainability information in fashion and can be extended to climate-related information; may inform broader AI applications.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

### [416] [Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26030)
*Shuche Wang,Fengzhuo Zhang,Jiaxiang Li,Cunxiao Du,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Zhuoran Yang,Mingyi Hong,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer's advantage over Adam arises from its alignment with linear associative memory structure in LLMs, particularly through VO attention weights and FFNs. Its update rule yields a more isotropic singular spectrum, enabling better learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed data, as supported by both empirical ablations and theoretical analysis of a one-layer model showing balanced learning across classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify why Muon trains larger language models faster and more effectively than Adam, especially on real-world, heavy-tailed corpora, by identifying the mechanisms and components responsible for its superior performance.

Method: 1) Ablate transformer components trained by Muon to isolate the role of associative memory parameters (Value and Output attention weights, and FFNs). 2) Analyze update rule properties, showing isotropy of the singular spectrum. 3) Test on heavy-tailed data to explain tail-class performance. 4) Provide theoretical analysis of a one-layer associative memory model under class imbalance to compare Muon and Adam.

Result: Ablation reveals VO attention weights and FFNs are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Muon's update rule produces a more isotropic singular spectrum, which translates to improved learning for tail classes on heavy-tailed corpora. Empirical results on real-world data align with theory, and the one-layer model shows Muon achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of embedding properties, while Adam can incur disparities. Overall, Muon's advantage stems from update-rule alignment with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling better tail-class learning and more balanced performance.

Conclusion: Muon's core benefit lies in its update rule, which aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, yielding more balanced and effective tail-class learning in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

### [417] [Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032)
*Xiaobao Wang,Ruoxiao Sun,Yujun Zhang,Bingdao Feng,Dongxiao He,Luzhi Wang,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSBA is a clean-label graph backdoor method for graph classifiers that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training to reduce structural/semantic anomalies and improve stealth while maintaining attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level backdoors are hard to conceal due to abnormal subgraphs and label flips; current methods create detectable anomalies that anomaly detectors exploit; a stealthier approach is needed.

Method: DPSBA learns triggers in-distribution using adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators, addressing both structural deviation and semantic deviation; clean-label setting means triggers do not require label manipulation.

Result: DPSBA achieves high attack success with significantly improved stealth in experiments on real-world datasets; outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in balancing effectiveness and detectability.

Conclusion: DPSBA offers a superior trade-off between attack effectiveness and stealth for graph-level backdoors and is validated on real-world data.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### [418] [Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26045)
*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA) is a scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model via weight averaging across domain-specific expert models trained on different temporal domains, using adaptive averaging coefficients derived from PCs of weight trajectories to improve temporal generalization with lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal Domain Generalization aims to handle distribution shifts over time (e.g., lexical changes) but existing methods either forecast full model weights (computationally expensive) or only adjust the classifier, limiting generalization. A scalable approach that updates more of the model is needed to better capture temporal dynamics without prohibitive cost.

Method: Construct domain expert models by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes to maintain similarity. Compute adaptive averaging coefficients by modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace, enabling bias-variance tradeoff control. Combine experts by weight averaging, with expert contributions guided by their proximity to potential future domains.

Result: Empirical evaluation across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 base models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient in terms of computation and memory compared to full-model prediction approaches.

Conclusion: TEA provides a scalable, effective TDG strategy by maintaining functional diversity among experts and parameter similarity via constrained fine-tuning, and by using principled, adaptive averaging to optimize bias-variance across temporal domains, achieving strong generalization with substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

*Hossein Enshaei,Pariya Jebreili,Sayed Mahmoud Sakahei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lightweight hybrid spectral-temporal EEG artifact detector for single-channel data using time-domain filtering + PSD features, PCA fusion, and a small MLP; robust to simultaneous artifacts and real-time capable, outperforming CNNs/RNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world EEG requires real-time, robust, and computationally efficient artifact detection; existing multi-channel and deep models are heavy and less robust to noise.

Method: Combine time-domain low-pass filtering targeting EOG and frequency-domain PSD features; PCA-based feature fusion to reduce redundancy; single hidden-layer MLP; evaluation under single- and multi-source noise; 30-second training times; real-time wearable BCI applicability.

Result: 99% accuracy at SNR -7 dB; >90% accuracy at SNR 4 dB; 96% accuracy under simultaneous EMG+EOG+white noise; 30-second training times, 97% faster than CNNs; robust across SNRs; outperforms CNNs/RNNs in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Domain-informed feature fusion can rival or surpass deep architectures in EEG artifact detection; supports real-time wearable BCI deployment; challenges the notion that deeper models are always superior; reduces model complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

### [420] [Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26114)
*Jaesung R. Park,Junsu Kim,Gyeongman Kim,Jinyoung Jo,Sean Choi,Jaewoong Cho,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropy clipping biases in PPO/GRPO affect RLVR-trained LLMs: clip-low tends to raise entropy and exploration, while clip-high lowers entropy; under typical parameters, clip-high dominates, causing entropy collapse even with random rewards; clipping can be used as a deliberate control knob to maintain exploration by increasing clip-low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why entropy collapse occurs in RLVR and identify hidden confounding factors beyond rewards, specifically how the clipping mechanism in PPO/GRPO biases entropy and shapes LLM reasoning behavior.

Method: Theoretical analysis of entropy dynamics under clipping in PPO/GRPO, complemented by empirical experiments showing entropy changes with clip-low and clip-high values and with random rewards to isolate clipping effects.

Result: Clip-low increases entropy; clip-high decreases entropy; with standard clipping, clip-high dominates, yielding overall entropy reduction even on random rewards; clipping can be used to control entropy and mitigate entropy collapse; more aggressive clip-low can promote exploration.

Conclusion: Entropy is a confounding factor in RLVR introduced by clipping bias; clipping should be treated as an explicit control knob for entropy to sustain exploration and prevent entropy collapse during long RLVR training; future work should optimize clipping strategy for robust reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UncertainGen introduces probabilistic embeddings for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a latent distribution to model sequence uncertainty, with theoretical guarantees and improved performance over deterministic methods on real data, enabling scalable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic representations (e.g., k-mer profiles, LLM embeddings) fail to capture uncertainty due to inter-species DNA sharing and highly similar fragments, hindering accurate binning.

Method: First probabilistic embedding approach for metagenomics; each fragment is represented as a probability distribution in latent space with a data-adaptive metric, plus theoretical guarantees on embedding distinguishability.

Result: Experiments on real metagenomic datasets show improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings, offering a scalable and lightweight solution for large-scale binning.

Conclusion: A probabilistic framework for metagenomic binning expands the feasible latent space and enables flexible separation of bins, validated by theory and empirical gains.

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

### [422] [Domain-Aware Hyperdimensional Computing for Edge Smart Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26131)
*Fardin Jalil Piran,Anandkumar Patel,Rajiv Malhotra,Farhad Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Domain-aware hyperdimensional computing (HDC) tuning is essential for edge deployment. Across CNC signal monitoring and LPBF image defect detection, hyperparameter effects are task-dependent and nonmonotonic; with careful encoder choice and dimensionality, HDC matches or exceeds DL accuracy while delivering ~6x faster inferences and >40x lower training energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for on-device AI with strict latency and energy budgets motivates lightweight alternatives like HDC. The common assumption that hyperparameter-performance relations are stable across tasks is likely false; understanding how encodings, dimensionality, and data regime shape performance is needed for practical, edge-friendly AI.

Method: Analyze two representative tasks (CNC quality monitoring from signals and LPBF defect detection from images). Systematically vary encoder type, projection variance, hypervector dimensionality, and data regime. Develop a formal complexity model for encoding and similarity computation. Perform empirical evaluations and train-tuning under multiobjective constraints. Compare against state-of-the-art deep learning/Transformer baselines.

Result: Signals: prefer nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings; accuracy saturates beyond moderate dimensionality. Images: prefer linear Random Projection; high accuracy achievable with small dimensionality; performance depends more on sample count than dimensionality. Multiobjective tuning yields models matching or exceeding DL/Transformer accuracy while delivering at least 6x faster inference and >40x lower training energy.

Conclusion: Domain-aware HDC encoding is necessary for practical edge AI. Tuned HDC offers a scalable, real-time pathway for industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work includes adaptive encoder/hyperparameter selection, expanding to additional manufacturing modalities, and validating on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

*Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage training: use Accelerator as a stable trainer to behavior-clone a transformer, then fine-tune online; yields stable transformer RL and faster learning with smaller replay buffer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models in model-free online RL for robotics face stability challenges. There is a need for stable training and efficient learning to harness transformers' representational power in real-time tasks.

Method: Stage 1: Train the transformer via behavior cloning using the Accelerator policy as trainer, while the Accelerator interacts with the environment independently. Stage 2: The pretrained transformer interacts online in a fully online setting. Experiments on ManiSkill (state-based and image-based) and MuJoCo (MDP and POMDP).

Result: The approach enables stable training of transformers and doubles image-based training speed in some tasks; it reduces the required replay buffer size in off-policy methods to 10–20k, lowering computational demands.

Conclusion: A two-stage training scheme using an Accelerator as a trainer makes transformer-based RL in robotics more stable and efficient, enabling faster online learning with reduced replay memory requirements.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-pronged framework combining ML surrogates, guided optimization, and data-management tooling to drastically accelerate fire simulations and reduce required runs, with Simvue enabling reuse and workflow organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand for large-scale, frequent fire simulations drives the need for faster, energy-efficient methods and better data management to support decision-making and safety planning.

Method: 1) Train a custom ML surrogate to predict heat propagation dynamics much faster than conventional CFD; 2) use guided optimization with lightweight models to decide which simulations to run, achieving a ~10x reduction in simulations when locating high-risk fire locations based on smoke visibility; 3) present Simvue, a framework/product that provides access to these tools plus automated organization and tracking to enable data reuse and reduce redundancy.

Result: The surrogate runs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CFD for this task; the guided optimization yields roughly a tenfold decrease in required simulations to identify dangerous locations; Simvue offers tooling for data management, reuse, and workflow tracking.

Conclusion: The integrated approach can substantially cut time and energy costs in fire-simulation pipelines and provide a scalable, reusable data-centric workflow via Simvue, potentially accelerating safety analyses and decision-making.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aligns language models at inference with alignment-aware decoding (AAD), an inference-time method that acts like implicit reward optimization, enhancing alignment without extra training beyond DPO; shows strong empirical gains across benchmarks and scales and can generate useful synthetic data when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment without costly retraining, by augmenting the decoding process itself and leveraging data-efficient improvements, including synthetic data generation in low-data regimes.

Method: Introduce alignment-aware decoding (AAD) during inference. Interpretable as implicit reward optimization; does not require beyond-standard DPO training.

Result: AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment benchmarks and model scales. In data-constrained settings, it can produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment with standard decoding.

Conclusion: AAD is a practical, training-light approach that enhances LLM alignment at inference time and offers a data-efficient path to improve alignment, including via synthetic data generation when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

*Thomas Hallopeau,Joris Guérin,Laurent Demagistri,Christovam Barcellos,Nadine Dessay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based framework uses a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network to classify central cells as informal settlements by leveraging neighboring cells, validated on Rio de Janeiro with spatial cross-validation across five zones; it outperforms single-cell baselines and simple neighbor feature concatenation (Kappa +17 points).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Informal settlements mapping is crucial for urban planning, public health, and infrastructure, but approaches that treat spatial units independently ignore the spatial dependencies and relational structure of urban fabric; incorporating local geographical context can improve detection accuracy.

Method: Construct a graph where each spatial unit (cell) is connected to its adjacent neighbors; train a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network to classify whether the central cell belongs to an informal settlement; evaluate with spatial cross-validation across five zones in Rio de Janeiro to assess robustness across heterogeneous urban landscapes.

Result: The graph-based approach outperforms standard baselines, achieving a 17-point increase in the Kappa coefficient over per-cell classification; it also surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring cells, demonstrating the value of encoding spatial structure.

Conclusion: Incorporating local geographical context via graph-based modeling improves informal settlement mapping and generalizes across heterogeneous urban landscapes, highlighting the benefit of structure-aware approaches for urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

### [427] [PDE Solvers Should Be Local: Fast, Stable Rollouts with Learned Local Stencils](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26186)
*Chun-Wun Cheng,Bin Dong,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A locality-focused neural PDE solver (FINO) uses learnable finite-difference-inspired blocks and explicit time-stepping to preserve local dynamics, achieving better accuracy and speed than global operator models, with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural operator models often rely on global mixing (e.g., spectral convolutions, attention) that oversmooth sharp local dynamics and incur high computational costs. There is a need for architectures that enforce locality while maintaining multiscale expressiveness and interpretability for PDE solvers.

Method: Propose FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural architecture with learnable convolutional kernels and explicit time-stepping. A Local Operator Block combines a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to create adaptive derivative-like local features. An encoder-decoder with a bottleneck captures local structures; theoretical results include a composition error bound for one-step to long-horizon rollouts under Lipschitz conditions and a universal approximation theorem for discrete-time PDE dynamics. Empirically evaluated on six benchmarks plus a climate-modeling task, compared to state-of-the-art operator-learning baselines.

Result: FINO achieves up to 44% lower error and up to ~2x speedups over SOTA operator-learning baselines across six benchmarks and a climate task, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping is effective for neural PDE solvers.

Conclusion: Strict locality with learnable time-stepping provides an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers, combining interpretability with multiscale representation and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Aaya Bougrine,Salmane El Mansour Billah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based IEQ forecasting (CO2, temp, humidity) using LSTM, GRU, and CNN-LSTM on ROBOD; GRU best for short-term, CNN-LSTM for longer horizons; enabling predictive BMS to reduce energy while maintaining comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IEQ impacts health and productivity but traditional HVAC is energy-intensive; predictive control using ML can navigate trade-offs between comfort and energy efficiency.

Method: Benchmark three architectures (LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM) on ROBOD dataset from a net-zero academic building to forecast IEQ variables over multiple horizons; analyze effects of data resolution, sensor placement, and occupancy; discuss suitability for predictive HVAC control.

Result: GRU yields superior short-term accuracy with lower computation; CNN-LSTM captures features for longer horizons; LSTM provides robust long-range modeling; accuracy sensitive to data resolution, sensor placement, occupancy; supports deploying predictive BMS strategies.

Conclusion: Deep learning-enabled predictive IEQ management can reduce energy use while maintaining occupant comfort; practical BMS deployment requires careful data acquisition and consideration of occupancy dynamics.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

### [429] [Marginal Flow: a flexible and efficient framework for density estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26221)
*Marcello Massimo Negri,Jonathan Aellen,Manuel Jahn,AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Marginal Flow: marginalizes latent variables with a learnable q_theta(w) to enable exact density evaluation and fast training/inference, without architectural constraints; supports manifolds and multimodal targets; demonstrated on synthetic data, simulation-based inference, PD matrices, and latent image manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome drawbacks of existing density models: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihoods, mode collapse, and bijective constraints; provide a flexible, efficient framework for density estimation and sampling.

Method: Define q_theta(x) via q(x|w) with latent w; sample w ~ q_theta(w) to marginalize; optimize q_theta parameters; use any objective (forward/reverse KL); no strict architectural constraints; enable learning distributions on manifolds; exact density evaluation is preserved; efficient sampling by drawing w.

Result: Showcases orders-of-magnitude speedups in training and inference; supports exact density evaluation; handles multi-modal targets and manifold learning; validated on synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on positive definite matrices, and latent-space image manifolds.

Conclusion: Marginal Flow provides a simple, flexible, and efficient framework that bypasses common limitations of density models, with broad applicability across domains and tasks, and strong empirical validation.

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

### [430] [Thinking-Free Policy Initialization Makes Distilled Reasoning Models More Effective and Efficient Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26226)
*Xin Xu,Cliveb AI,Kai Yang,Tianhao Chen,Yang Wang,Saiyong Yang,Can Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFPI introduces a ThinkFree token-discarding step to RLVR, reducing inference cost while preserving or improving performance; it bridges long-chain-of-thought distillation with standard RLVR, yielding faster convergence and strong accuracy with modest compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR requires extremely long context during training, causing high computational costs. Reducing context or token usage without sacrificing performance is desirable, and a simple modification could bridge CoT distillation with standard RLVR.

Method: Apply ThinkFree: append a </think> token to inputs to explicitly discard thinking content, training a 4B model with TFPI on RLVR-like tasks. This avoids specialized rewards or complex training and aims to reduce token usage during inference while maintaining or improving performance.

Result: TFPI accelerates RL convergence, raises the performance ceiling, and improves token efficiency of reasoning models. On benchmarks, a 4B TFPI model attains 89.0% on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench with under 4K H20 hours.

Conclusion: TFPI provides a simple, effective adaptation to RLVR that reduces token usage and speeds up training without requiring specialized rewards or complex designs, achieving strong results even in slow-thinking modes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

### [431] [Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234)
*Ayush Patnaik,Adam B Zufall,Stephen K Robinson,Xinfan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian Process-based modeling of Q(V) with analytic dQ/dV and uncertainty for robust lithium plating detection; supports online operation in BMS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium plating during fast charging accelerates capacity fade and safety risks. Conventional dQ/dV computation uses finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and biases peak localization. A probabilistic, noise-aware method with uncertainty quantification is needed for reliable, real-time plating detection.

Method: Treat Q(V) as a Gaussian Process, leveraging GP derivatives to obtain dQ/dV analytically from the posterior. Learn hyperparameters from data, provide credible intervals for uncertainty, and enable online variants suitable for embedded BMS.

Result: GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks across operating conditions (0.2C–1C, 0–40°C); avoids false positives in baseline cases; plating peak concurrence with reduced charge throughput and measured capacity fade confirms accuracy and robustness; supports real-time detection.

Conclusion: A scalable, noise-aware probabilistic framework for real-time lithium plating detection suitable for deployment in battery management systems.

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

### [432] [Beyond Linear Probes: Dynamic Safety Monitoring for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26238)
*James Oldfield,Philip Torr,Ioannis Patras,Adel Bibi,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs) enable dynamic, cost-aware safety monitoring for LLMs by progressively evaluating polynomial terms, allowing cheap early checks or stronger guardrails as needed. They match or exceed MLP-based probes of the same size and offer greater interpretability. Codes provided for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety monitors currently incur uniform compute per query, wasting resources on easy cases and risking misses on hard ones. There is a need for monitors whose cost scales with input difficulty or available compute, balancing safety with efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Extend linear probes to Truncated Polynomial Classifiers that train and evaluate polynomial terms progressively. At test time, you can early-stop for lightweight monitoring or use more terms for stronger guardrails. Two use modes: (1) safety dial—adjust guardrail strength by evaluating more terms; (2) adaptive cascade—simple cases exit early, ambiguous ones trigger higher-order checks.

Result: Evaluated on two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails) across 4 models up to 30B parameters. TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probes of the same size and offer greater interpretability than black-box alternatives.

Conclusion: TPCs provide a cost-efficient, scalable, and interpretable approach to monitoring LLM activations, adaptable to budget and risk requirements. The authors release their code for implementation.

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

### [433] [Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26239)
*Joel Dyer,Daniel Jarne Ornia,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical and methodological study of sandbagging in frontier AI safety evaluations: models strategic deception in sequential tasks, proves sandbagging can arise for rational agents, and builds a statistical test to distinguish sandbagging from incompetence, validated via simulations; aims to enable robust evaluation procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguard evaluation integrity by separating true incompetence from deliberate sandbagging, addressing risk that agents manipulate results when aware of evaluation.

Method: Develops a simple sequential-decision model inspired by survival bandits; proves analytically that optimal agents can sandbag; constructs a statistical test using sequences of test scores to classify behavior; runs simulations to assess reliability in bandit settings.

Result: The test can distinguish sandbagging from incompetence in the proposed model; simulation results evaluate the reliability of the test; demonstrates potential for robust statistical procedures in frontier model evaluation.

Conclusion: Offers a pathway toward robust evaluative procedures for frontier AI and underscores need for further work to apply and validate in real systems and across broader evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

### [434] [From Fragile to Certified: Wasserstein Audits of Group Fairness Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26241)
*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Wasserstein distributionally robust framework for auditing group fairness, named ε-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness (ε-WDF), with a tractable estimator (DRUNE) and finite-sample guarantees that remains stable under distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary drastically across resamples and under distribution shift, undermining reliable audits. A robust auditing framework is needed to certify fairness under plausible distributional perturbations.

Method: Introduce a Wasserstein ball around the empirical distribution and a generic conditional-probability functional to unify fairness notions, defining ε-WDF as the audit target. Use strong duality to derive tractable reformulations and develop DRUNE, an efficient estimator for ε-WDF. Prove feasibility, consistency, and finite-sample certification guarantees, plus bounds under smoothness and margin conditions.

Result: Demonstrates that ε-WDF provides stable fairness assessments across standard benchmarks and classifiers under distribution shift, with a practical estimator and rigorous guarantees.

Conclusion: Offers a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness beyond observational data, by delivering distributionally robust fairness certificates under plausible distribution changes.

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wasserstein DRO is extended to address individual fairness under causal structures; provides dual reformulation, a closed-form regularizer for worst-case loss, generalizations, and finite-sample bounds when causal models are estimated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap at the intersection of DRO, individual fairness, and causal inference to enable robust, fair learning under distributional shifts without assuming a known causal model.

Method: Formulate DRO from causality and individual fairness; derive a dual formulation for computational tractability; obtain a closed-form approximation of the worst-case loss as a regularizer, eliminating the max step in min-max DRO; generalize to broader cases; analyze connections to classical robust optimization; provide finite-sample error bounds when using empirical distributions and estimated causal structures.

Result: Efficient dual-based reformulation of the DRO problem; a regularizer capturing worst-case loss, replacing the outer max; broader applicability with regularizer estimation; finite-sample guarantees; clarified relationship between DRO and robust optimization.

Conclusion: Enables practical, robust learning under fairness and causal-awareness; emphasizes the importance of estimating causal structures; advances integration of DRO, fairness, and causality in learning models.

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

*Anthony Zhou,Alexander Wikner,Amaury Lancelin,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stochastic interpolants provide a more efficient and accurate alternative to Gaussian-noise denoising for physical emulation, achieving higher fidelity with fewer sampling steps across PDEs and dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models are increasingly used as surrogates for physical systems, but methods that denoise Gaussian noise may not be optimal for autoregressive predictions; leveraging the proximity of successive physical distributions could improve efficiency and fidelity.

Method: Benchmark across diverse physical domains; learn a stochastic process (stochastic interpolant) between current and future states; compare to models that transport Gaussian noise; study sampling step requirements and the balance between accuracy, spectral consistency, and probabilistic calibration.

Result: Stochastic interpolants can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than Gaussian-noise-based models; they help balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and probabilistic calibration.

Conclusion: Stochastic interpolants are a competitive baseline for physical emulation and offer insights into how different generative frameworks can be tuned via sampling to meet multiple objectives in physical prediction tasks.

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

*Lionel Blondé,Joao A. Candido Ramos,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NGT offers data-efficient imitation learning by framing imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial training; works with minimal demonstrations and no pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In low-data regimes, large-scale pretraining is impractical and high-capacity models can be inefficient; there is a need for data-efficient, easy-to-deploy imitation methods for continuous control.

Method: Noise-Guided Transport (NGT) casts imitation as an optimal transport problem and solves it through adversarial training. It is lightweight, off-policy, requires no pretraining or specialized architectures, and inherently provides uncertainty estimation.

Result: NGT achieves strong performance on challenging continuous-control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under ultra-low data regimes (as few as 20 transitions). Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: A simple, data-efficient imitation-learning approach that avoids pretrained models and large architectures can be competitive, easy to implement and tune, and well-suited for scenarios with very limited demonstrations.

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Rob V. van Nieuwpoort,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for hyperparameter tuning of auto-tuning algorithms that uses robust statistics, reproducible data, and replay simulations to dramatically improve auto-tuner performance with significant cost reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-tuning frameworks have many hyperparameters that are rarely tuned, and their impact on performance is not well studied. Tuning these hyperparameters could substantially accelerate optimization in diverse domains.

Method: Propose a general hyperparameter-tuning method for optimization algorithms used in auto-tuning. It includes a robust statistical evaluation across search spaces, a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data to cut costs. The approach also demonstrates that hyperparameters can themselves be optimized efficiently with meta-strategies.

Result: Limited hyperparameter tuning improves auto-tuner performance by 94.8% on average; hyperparameters optimized with meta-strategies yield an average improvement of 204.7%.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning is a powerful and often overlooked lever for advancing auto-tuning; the work provides reproducible data and tools, a cost-effective simulation approach, and demonstrates substantial performance gains from tuning the tuner.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

TL;DR: A two-stage alignment approach (NeuroTTT) for EEG foundation models that combines domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning with test-time training. It achieves state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy across EEG tasks by aligning latent representations to spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG cues and by updating normalization statistics at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment between large pretrained EEG models and downstream tasks, along with significant cross-subject distribution shifts that hurt generalization.

Method: Stage 1: NeuroTTT — domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning that injects task-relevant self-supervised objectives to align latent EEG features (spectral, spatial, temporal) without labels. Stage 2: test-time training at inference — (i) self-supervised TTT on each unlabeled test sample, and (ii) Tent-style prediction entropy minimization that updates only normalization statistics to calibrate the model for each input. Backbones CBraMod and LaBraM. Evaluated on imagined speech, stress detection, and motor imagery.

Result: Significant improvements in robustness and accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods across three diverse EEG tasks.

Conclusion: The work is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training for large-scale EEG foundation models, effectively bridging pretraining and downstream EEG decoding in a task-agnostic but sample-adaptive manner.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

### [440] [Attribution-Guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26307)
*Piotr Komorowski,Elena Golimblevskaia,Reduan Achtibat,Thomas Wiegand,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attribution-Guided Decoding (AGD) uses attribution to a user-defined Region of Interest (ROI) to select among high-probability next tokens, steering LLM outputs toward desired behavior. It improves instruction adherence and factual accuracy and includes an adaptive, entropy-based variant to reduce overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoding often fails to enforce complex instructions and factual correctness; existing control methods can hurt output quality. There's a need for a more interpretable, flexible decoding approach that can steer generation without altering model activations.

Method: AGD considers a set of top-probability output token candidates and computes their attributions with respect to a ROI defined over inputs/internal components. It selects the token with the highest attribution to ROI. ROI can be defined flexibly across various parts of the model. An adaptive entropy-based variant applies guidance only when the model is uncertain to save computation and maintain quality.

Result: Across three challenging domains, AGD improves instruction following (e.g., Llama 3.1 success rate from 66.0% to 79.1%). Guiding generation toward internal knowledge components or contextual sources reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy in both closed-book and open-book settings. The adaptive variant mitigates quality degradation and lowers computational overhead.

Conclusion: AGD offers a versatile, interpretable, and effective decoding strategy to enhance the reliability of modern LLMs without sacrificing output quality in many tasks.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

### [441] [A Review on Single-Problem Multi-Attempt Heuristic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26321)
*Judith Echevarrieta,Etor Arza,Aritz Pérez,Josu Ceberio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Focused review unifying single-problem multi-attempt heuristic optimization strategies into a common framework and taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practice, one problem is often tackled by trying multiple heuristic configurations or algorithms within a given budget. Existing reviews lack a unified treatment of sequential selection strategies across different topics (algorithm selection, parameter tuning, multi-start, resource allocation).

Method: Systematically synthesize literature across four strands (algorithm selection, parameter tuning, multi-start, resource allocation), using unified terminology to develop a common framework and taxonomy.

Result: A cohesive taxonomy/framework that classifies and connects strategies from the four strands, clarifying relationships and identifying gaps.

Conclusion: The work provides a coherent basis for designing sequential strategies and highlights directions for empirical validation and extension of the taxonomy.

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

*Margarita A. Guerrero,Cristian R. Rojas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACE: a sample-efficient counterfactual explainer that uses Bayesian estimation and adaptive sampling to approximate decision boundaries with fewer queries, achieving better efficiency while finding minimal, actionable changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high query cost and practicality issues of existing CFEs when models are black-box or access is limited; aim to achieve accurate CFEs with far fewer evaluations.

Method: Integrates Bayesian estimation with stochastic optimization to adaptively sample points near the decision boundary. Prioritizes informative queries to efficiently approximate the classifier boundary and identify minimal, feasible counterfactuals.

Result: Empirical results show ACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in evaluation efficiency while maintaining effectiveness in finding minimal and actionable counterfactuals.

Conclusion: ACE offers a practical, query-efficient path to generating CFEs under limited model access; suitable for cost-sensitive or interactive settings where model evaluations are expensive.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

### [443] [A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26327)
*Charles Westphal,Stephen Hailes,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB): a synergy-based reformulation of IB that uses average interaction information to define synergy, addressing estimation limitations and demonstrating superior generalization and interpretable compression dynamics across CNNs and Transformers, including ReLU nets, with implications for adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome theoretical ambiguities and practical estimation challenges in the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework and to capture what is learned via joint processing (synergy) of features.

Method: Reformulate IB in terms of a computable synergy measure based on average interaction information (II) among each feature and the rest; prove an upper bound relationship where the original IB objective is bounded by GIB under perfect estimation; validate across architectures.

Result: GIB exhibits consistent compression phases across diverse architectures (including ReLU-backed networks where standard IB fails), yields interpretable dynamics in CNNs and Transformers, and aligns with notions of adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: A compatible yet enhanced IB framework—GIB—addresses IB's limitations, improves generalization through synergy-based representations, and provides a practical, interpretable lens on network dynamics and robustness.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

### [444] [FedMuon: Federated Learning with Bias-corrected LMO-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26337)
*Yuki Takezawa,Anastasia Koloskova,Xiaowen Jiang,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMuon adapts Muon's LMO-based optimization to federated learning, mitigating LMO bias, with convergence guaranteed even when the LMO is solved approximately via Newton-Schulz iterations; more accurate LMO yields faster convergence; empirically outperforms SOTA FL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage fast Muon optimizer in federated learning while addressing the bias of the linear minimization oracle (LMO) that breaks convergence in naive integration; achieve faster, robust FL training.

Method: Propose FedMuon as local optimizer in FedAvg to mitigate LMO bias; analyze impact of approximate LMO solving; use Newton-Schulz iterations to approximate LMO; provide theoretical convergence results for any iteration count; conduct experiments comparing to state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: Theoretical: FedMuon converges with any number of Newton-Schulz iterations; convergence accelerates with higher LMO accuracy. Empirical: FedMuon outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Conclusion: FedMuon successfully mitigates LMO bias in FL, enabling robust and faster training; approximate LMO is viable and beneficial; the approach advances FL performance.

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

### [445] [Memory-Driven Self-Improvement for Decision Making with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26340)
*Xue Yan,Zijing Ou,Mengyue Yang,Yan Song,Haifeng Zhang,Yingzhen Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A memory-driven framework couples LLM general priors with a compact, domain-specific experience memory to iteratively self-improve SDM policies. This loop enhances value estimation and policy quality, yielding strong improvements on ALFWorld tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs carry broad before-task knowledge but struggle with task-specific data scarcity in sequential decision-making. There is a need for efficient adaptation that leverages past experience to refine priors and improve decision quality in SDM.

Method: Maintain a compact memory of past interactions and associated Q-values. Use this memory to refine the LLM's prior for future decisions. The refined prior generates higher-reward trajectories, which enrich the memory in turn, creating a memory-LLM mutual reinforcement loop.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the memory-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional RL and pure LLM baselines, with gains of over 40% on in-distribution tasks and over 75% when generalizing to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Conclusion: Memory and LLM priors form a natural self-improvement cycle for SDM that efficiently adapts to task-specific regimes with limited data, achieving strong generalization to new tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

### [446] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive-Clarification RL trains vision-language models to anticipate a reasoning system's needs by penalizing solutions that rely on later clarifications, yielding more complete initial captions and improved visual mathematical reasoning without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an interface mismatch: captioning for human readers often omits critical visual details that reasoning systems require, causing reasoning failures even when inherent reasoning ability is sufficient.

Method: Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL) trains vision models through interaction to surface information gaps. The model is penalized when a solution would require clarification, encouraging richer initial captions that enable one-pass reasoning and treating clarifications as implicit supervision.

Result: AC-RL yields an average improvement of 4.4 percentage points in accuracy over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks; analysis suggests clarifications could be reduced by up to 39% if allowed.

Conclusion: Clarification requests can be used as a form of implicit supervision to train vision-language interfaces, enabling effective reasoning on visual tasks without explicit annotations.

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

### [447] [LLM-Assisted Emergency Triage Benchmark: Bridging Hospital-Rich and MCI-Like Field Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26351)
*Joshua Sebastian,Karma Tobden,KMA Solaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An open, LLM-assisted emergency triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital mortality) with two regimes: hospital-rich data and an MCI-like field simulation; uses LLMs to harmonize data, select features, and align schemas; provides baseline models and SHAP interpretablity to reveal gaps and key features; aims to democratize and reproducibilize triage research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triage research lacks openly usable, reproducible benchmarks and bridges from raw clinical data to practical triage predictions. Transforming datasets like MIMIC-IV-ED requires heavy preprocessing and schema alignment, restricting access to highly technical users.

Method: Create an open benchmark with two regimes (hospital-rich with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints; and MCI-like field with vitals, observations, notes). Employ LLMs to harmonize noisy fields (e.g., AVPU, breathing devices), prioritize clinically relevant vitals/labs, and guide schema alignment and merging of disparate tables. Provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses to compare regimes and identify key features for triage.

Result: A reproducible, accessible triage benchmark enabled by LLM-assisted data curation and schema harmonization. Demonstrates predictive gaps between the hospital-rich and field-simulation regimes and highlights the features most critical for triage via SHAP explanations.

Conclusion: This work advances dataset democratization in clinical AI by offering an openly accessible benchmark and baseline models for emergency triage, reducing barriers to entry and enabling more researchers to pursue reliable triage predictions.

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

### [448] [Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625)
*Junlin Han,Shengbang Tong,David Fan,Yufan Ren,Koustuv Sinha,Philip Torr,Filippos Kokkinos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language pre-training endows LLMs with separable visual priors: a transferable visual reasoning prior and a broad but encoder-sensitive perception prior; a data-centric pre-training recipe is validated at 1T tokens, with the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench) introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how visual priors emerge in LLMs and how to cultivate them efficiently for multimodal capabilities.

Method: Systematic, controlled experiments across five model scales, 100+ experiments, 500k GPU-hours, exploring data types (reasoning-centric data, broad corpora, text describing the visual world), training and alignment pipelines, and evaluation of latent priors and their transfer to visual tasks; propose and test a data-centric pre-training recipe; introduce MLE-Bench and validate on 1T-token scale pre-training.

Result: Found that latent visual reasoning ability is mainly developed by reasoning-centric data and scales with data; this reasoning prior transfers to visual reasoning tasks; perception priors arise from broad corpora and are sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning; text descriptions of the visual world are crucial but their impact saturates; a data-centric pre-training recipe improves visual priors and is validated at 1T-token scale across experiments; evidence gathered across >100 experiments and multiple stages (pre-training, alignment, fine-tuning).

Conclusion: Visual priors for multimodal LLMs can be cultivated deliberately through language pre-training by separately nurturing reasoning and perception priors; this enables next-generation multimodal LLMs, with MLE-Bench providing evaluation and a scalable path via a data-centric pre-training recipe.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

### [449] [Data-to-Energy Stochastic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26364)
*Kirill Tamogashev,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a data-free method to learn Schrödinger bridge dynamics when one or both marginals are given as unnormalised densities, extending IPF with reinforcement-learning ideas to off-policy diffusion samplers; demonstrates multimodal transport learning, diffusion-coefficient improvements, and a data-free image-to-image translation application; provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Schrödinger bridge problem generalises stochastic optimal transport and links to diffusion models and flow matching, but prior methods require samples from both marginals. A data-free approach enables applying Schrödinger bridges to settings where densities are known only up to normalization or are not represented by samples, broadening applicability to natural sciences and generative modeling.

Method: Generalise iterative proportional fitting (IPF) to the data-free case by leveraging off-policy reinforcement learning concepts used in training diffusion samplers. The method operates under a fixed time-discretisation of the dynamics and introduces a data-to-energy IPF (d2e IPF) framework to infer the bridge from unnormalised densities. The approach also permits learning the diffusion coefficient to improve data-to-data Schrödinger-bridge methods.

Result: Empirically demonstrates that the proposed data-to-energy IPF can learn transports between multimodal distributions in synthetic problems. When applied to latent-space posterior sampling in generative models, it enables data-free image-to-image translation. The secondary outcome shows that learning the diffusion coefficient can substantially improve existing data-to-data Schrödinger bridge algorithms.

Conclusion: This work presents the first general method for data-free Schrödinger bridges, expanding the applicability of Schrödinger bridge techniques to settings with unnormalised densities and no samples. It opens pathways for better diffusion-based samplers and energy-based modeling, and provides code for practical adoption.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

*Benno Kaech,Luis Wyss,Karsten Borgwardt,Gianvito Grasso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A discrete-flow model for fragmented SMILES (InVirtuoGen) enabling de novo and fragment-constrained molecule generation, plus lead optimization. Claims state-of-the-art on Practical Molecular Optimization benchmarks and improved docking scores; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of masked/auto-regressive models for fragment-based molecule generation and optimization. Need a unified framework that can produce diverse, high-quality fragments and efficiently perform multi-objective optimization.

Method: A discrete normalizing-flow that transforms a uniform source over tokens into the molecular data distribution. Training uses a denoising-like loss that accounts for predictions at all sequence positions at every step, enabling refinement rather than simple completion and decoupling sampling steps from sequence length. For de novo tasks, it improves quality-diversity; for optimization, combines a genetic algorithm with a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete flows.

Result: Achieves a stronger quality-diversity Pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models for de novo generation and competitive results on fragment-constrained tasks. Sets new state-of-the-art (top-10 AUC across PMO tasks) and yields higher docking scores in lead optimization than baselines.

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen provides a versatile, reproducible foundation for drug discovery—from hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization—and authors release pretrained checkpoints and code to support open science.

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

### [451] [Ascent Fails to Forget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26427)
*Ioannis Mavrothalassitis,Pol Puigdemont,Noam Itzhak Levi,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient ascent-based unlearning often fails due to inherent statistical dependence between forget and retain data; even simple correlations can cause divergence or worse performance, questioning the viability of such unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning seeks to remove influence of forgotten data. This paper challenges the standard assumption of independence between forget and retain sets and argues that gradient-based unlearning can be misled by their statistical relationship, potentially leaving the model worse off than before.

Method: The authors provide both empirical and theoretical analyses. They examine random forget sets to show how dependence degrades forget-set metrics and harms overall test performance. They study logistic regression as an instructive example where inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent to diverge from a retrained ideal. A toy example illustrates trapping in poor local minima. They also conduct experiments on complex neural networks to corroborate the theoretical claims.

Result: The results show that gradient ascent-based unlearning can fail due to inter-set dependence, with convergence to solutions far from the retrained ideal and potentially worse than the original model. The dependence can cause degradation in forget metrics to translate into poorer test performance, and the methods can get trapped in inferior local minima even when only correlations exist between forget and retain sets.

Conclusion: Statistical dependencies between forget and retain data can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. This challenges the common belief in straightforward retraining-based unlearning and highlights the need for unlearning approaches that account for such dependencies, as current gradient-based methods may be actively detrimental.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

### [452] [AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432)
*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBlock-dLLM introduces a training-free, adaptive block scheduler for diffusion-based LLMs that aligns block boundaries with semantic steps using a volatility band (VB). It overcomes fixed-block limitations in semi-autoregressive decoding, achieving up to 5.3% accuracy gains at the same throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two fundamental flaws of fixed-block semi-AR decoding: (i) late decoding overhead due to unmasking high-confidence tokens outside the current block, and (ii) premature decoding error from early commitment of low-confidence tokens inside the block. The paper seeks to move beyond fixed block size by enabling semantic-aware, adaptive block sizing.

Method: Perform a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during dLLM denoising to identify a volatility band (VB) region that encodes local semantic structure. Propose AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that dynamically adjusts block size during runtime to align with semantic steps.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget, demonstrating robust gains from semantics-aware adaptive scheduling.

Conclusion: Semantics-aware adaptive scheduling can mitigate fixed-block limitations in semi-AR decoding and may inform future training strategies for dLLMs, highlighting the potential of runtime block-size adaptation to improve accuracy without sacrificing throughput.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

### [453] [ACT: Agentic Classification Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26433)
*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic Classification Tree (ACT) extends decision-tree methods to unstructured inputs by turning each split into a natural-language question evaluated via impurity measures and LLM feedback (TextGrad); it achieves transparent, interpretable text classification and matches or exceeds prompt-based baselines on text benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes settings, AI decisions must be transparent, interpretable, and auditable. Traditional CART handles only structured data and lacks interpretability for unstructured inputs like text. LLM prompting strategies struggle with trustworthiness and verifiability. ACT aims to combine the transparency of decision trees with the ability to process unstructured text.

Method: Formulate each tree split as a natural-language question. Use impurity-based evaluation to guide splits. Incorporate LLM feedback via TextGrad to refine questions and splits. Train and evaluate on text benchmarks to compare with prompt-based baselines.

Result: ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines on text benchmarks while producing transparent, interpretable decision paths.

Conclusion: Extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs, preserving interpretability and auditability in text-rich tasks, and offering a principled alternative to prompt-driven LLM reasoning.

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

### [454] [Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26442)
*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Robbins-Siegmund to almost supermartingales with non-summable (but square-summable) zero-order terms under mild increment assumptions; proves almost sure convergence to a bounded set, provides convergence rates, high-probability bounds, and L^p rates; applies to stochastic approximation and RL, including the first AS rate, high-probability bound, and L^p rate for Q-learning with linear function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Robbins-Siegmund theorem requires the zero-order term to be summable, which is often violated in reinforcement learning. This work relaxes that condition to square-summability, enabling convergence analysis for a broader class of RL algorithms and stochastic approximation methods.

Method: Introduce a mild increment condition and a square-summable zero-order term framework for almost supermartingales. Prove almost sure convergence to a bounded set, derive convergence rates (almost sure, high-probability, and L^p), and apply the theory to stochastic approximation and RL, highlighting Q-learning with linear function approximation.

Result: Proves almost sure convergence to a bounded set under the new conditions. Establishes almost sure convergence rates, high-probability concentration bounds, and L^p convergence rates. Demonstrates the first such results for Q-learning with linear function approximation (AS rate, high-probability bound, and L^p rate).

Conclusion: The work extends convergence theory for stochastic approximation and RL to settings where the zero-order term is not summable, broadening applicability and providing practical rates and probabilistic guarantees, notably for Q-learning with linear function approximation.

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

*Oleksandr Shchur,Abdul Fatir Ansari,Caner Turkmen,Lorenzo Stella,Nick Erickson,Pablo Guerron,Michael Bohlke-Schneider,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new benchmark, fev-bench, provides 100 forecasting tasks (across seven domains, with 46 tasks including covariates) and a lightweight library, fev, to enable reproducible benchmarking. It uses bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model comparisons via win rates and skill scores, supporting principled aggregation and seamless integration into existing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark quality for time series forecasting is often limited by narrow domain coverage, missing covariate scenarios, weak statistical aggregation, and poor integration infrastructure. This hampers meaningful evaluation of pretrained models and progress.

Method: Construct fev-bench with 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains (46 with covariates). Provide fev, a Python library for benchmarking that integrates with existing workflows. Use principled aggregation with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model performance along two dimensions: win rates and skill scores.

Result: Feasible evaluation on fev-bench demonstrated across various pretrained, statistical, and baseline models, with bootstrapped CIs and two complementary performance dimensions, enabling robust comparisons and insights into future research directions.

Conclusion: fev-bench and fev address key benchmark shortcomings by expanding domain/covariate coverage, enforcing statistical rigor, and offering reproducible infrastructure, thereby guiding progress in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiVeQ and SF-DiVeQ enable end-to-end trainable quantization by letting gradients flow through a quantization distortion vector and a space-filling curve over codewords, improving VQ-VAE reconstruction and VQGAN generation without auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard assignments in vector quantization block gradients and hinder end-to-end training of VQ-based models; a method is needed that preserves forward behavior while enabling gradient-based optimization.

Method: Introduce an error vector that mimics quantization distortion, allowing gradient flow while keeping the forward pass hard. SF-DiVeQ constructs a space-filling curve along lines connecting codewords to encourage full codebook usage and reduce quantization error. Both approaches require no auxiliary losses or temperature schedules.

Result: When applied to VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation across various datasets, the methods yield improved reconstruction quality and sample quality compared to alternative quantization approaches.

Conclusion: DiVeQ and SF-DiVeQ offer end-to-end trainable vector quantization with better performance and full codebook utilization, avoiding extra loss terms or schedules and improving stability and efficiency of quantized models.

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

*Gerrit Gerhartz,Peter Lippmann,Fred A. Hamprecht*

TL;DR: Transfer tensor field networks into a local canonicalization framework to improve efficiency while preserving equivariance; release tensor_frames PyTorchGeometric package for easy integration into GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equivariant networks provide strong inductive biases for molecular/geometric data but are computationally expensive; there is a need for efficient representations and practical integration with standard graph neural networks.

Method: Introduce a framework to map existing tensor field networks into a local canonicalization paradigm; systematically compare equivariant representations in terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy; publish tensor_frames, a PyTorchGeometric-based implementation enabling local canonicalization within standard message-passing networks.

Result: The framework yields significant runtime improvements while preserving equivariance; comparative analysis informs tradeoffs between representation choices; tensor_frames package released for easy adoption in PyTorch Geometric workflows.

Conclusion: Local canonicalization provides a practical, efficient path for deploying equivariant learning on molecular and geometric data; the framework and tooling reduce barriers to adoption and facilitate broader experimentation.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

### [458] [Entropy After $\langle \texttt{/Think} \rangle$ for reasoning model early exiting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26522)
*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple entropy-based early-exit signal (Entropy After Think, EAT) detects when chain-of-thought reasoning has plateaued to stop, reducing token usage by 13–21% on MATH500 and AIME2025 without hurting accuracy; works even in black-box settings via proxy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning tends to overthink after arriving at a correct solution, wasting compute. The Pass@1 improvement plateaus and a cheap signal is sought to exit early as soon as reasoning stops yielding gains.

Method: Append a stop-thinking token (</think>) and monitor the entropy of the following token during reasoning. The entropy trajectory decreases and stabilizes as Pass@1 plateaus. A stopping rule uses the variance of this entropy under an exponential moving average. This allows adaptive compute allocation rather than a fixed token budget and remains usable even when logits are inaccessible by using proxy models.

Result: Empirically, EAT reduces token usage by 13–21% on MATH500 and AIME2025 without harming accuracy; it also works in black-box settings where the model's logits are not available, using proxy models to estimate entropy.

Conclusion: Entropy After Think (EAT) provides a simple, inexpensive, and effective signal for adaptive early exit in chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling more efficient computation with maintained performance and applicability in black-box scenarios.

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

### [459] [TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524)
*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage adaptive personalization (TAP) for federated learning with heterogeneous clients and multi-task/multi-modal models; introduces selective architecture replacement and post-FL knowledge distillation, plus convergence analysis; shows empirical gains across datasets; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization in FL for foundation models with multi-task/multi-modal characteristics is underexplored, especially when clients differ in data, tasks, and modalities and where server-client architecture mismatches occur. There is also a lack of convergence analysis for such heterogeneous setups.

Method: TAP consists of two stages: (i) selective architecture replacement when client-server mismatches benefit local tasks, allowing model architecture heterogeneity; (ii) post-FL knowledge distillation to capture beneficial general knowledge without eroding client personalization. The paper also provides the first convergence analysis of the server model under a modality-task pair architecture.

Result: Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and tasks show TAP outperforms multiple baselines. The approach demonstrates the benefits of architecture replacement and post-FL distillation for personalization in heterogeneous FL. A notable finding is that increasing the number of modality-task pairs degrades the server's ability to cater to all tasks, highlighting a trade-off. The code is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: TAP addresses a key gap in personalized FL for heterogeneous, multi-task/multi-modal settings by combining architecture-aware personalization with post-FL knowledge distillation and provides theoretical convergence insights along with strong empirical validation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven supervised ML approach is proposed to retrofit load-shedding decisions in power grids to defend against instability attacks, demonstrated via a proof-of-concept on the IEEE 14-bus system using Modified Prony Analysis (MPA) to detect attacks and trigger defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical infrastructure like the power grid is increasingly complex and essential, making it an attractive target for cyberattacks. Instability attacks have relatively few protections, necessitating cost-effective defensive methods.

Method: Train a supervised machine learning model to retrofit load-shedding decision systems for resilience against instability attacks. Use Modified Prony Analysis (MPA) as a detection mechanism. Demonstrate with IEEE 14-bus system and Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer.

Result: Proof-of-concept demonstration showing that MPA can detect instability attacks and trigger defense mechanisms; the approach is presented as viable, with a data-driven retrofit strategy.

Conclusion: A cost-effective, data-driven retrofit of load-shedding decision systems can enhance defense against instability attacks; MPA provides a viable detection and triggering method, warranting further validation on larger systems.

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the loss kernel, a covariance-based similarity between data points computed from per-sample losses under perturbations of model parameters; validated on synthetic multitask data and ImageNet to reflect task structure and WordNet semantics; proposed as a practical interpretability/data-attribution tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable, data-centric measure of similarity that reveals how a trained neural network treats different inputs, enabling visualization of data structure and attribution of predictions.

Method: Compute per-sample losses under a distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations, form their covariance matrix across samples to define a kernel; validate on a synthetic multitask problem showing task-separation and apply to Inception-v1 on ImageNet to assess alignment with WordNet hierarchy.

Result: On synthetic data, the kernel separates inputs by task as theory predicts; on ImageNet, the kernel structure aligns with WordNet semantic hierarchy, supporting interpretability and data attribution.

Conclusion: The loss kernel is a practical tool for interpreting neural networks and attributing data relevance, with demonstrated connections to both task structure and semantic hierarchy.

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

### [462] [TASP: Topology-aware Sequence Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26541)
*Yida Wang,Ke Hong,Xiuhong Li,Yuanchao Xu,Wenxun Wang,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP is a topology-aware sequence-parallel method for long-context LLMs that decomposes accelerator topology into multiple concurrent ring datapaths to boost communication efficiency, outperforming Ring Attention and Zigzag-Ring by up to 3.58x; validated on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300X, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLMs are bottlenecked by quadratic self-attention and current SP approaches (e.g., Ring Attention) suffer from poor communication efficiency due to a mismatch between Ring AllGather and modern AlltoAll topologies.

Method: Leverage Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs to identify multiple orthogonal ring datapaths. Decompose Ring AllGather into concurrent ring transfers at each iteration. Propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method that uses topology and primitive decomposition to fully utilize accelerator communication capacity. Evaluate on single-node/multi-node NVIDIA H100 and a single-node AMD MI300X, comparing against Ring Attention and Zigzag-Ring Attention.

Result: TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention and Zigzag-Ring Attention, with up to 3.58x speedup. Demonstrated across NVIDIA H100 clusters and an AMD MI300X node.

Conclusion: Topology-aware SP designs like TASP can fully exploit modern accelerator topologies to alleviate communication bottlenecks in long-context LLMs, offering substantial speedups and practical applicability. The approach is supported by code availability.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical influence functions struggle with deep networks due to non-invertible Hessians and extreme parameter dimensionality, making reliable influence estimates hard and computationally expensive.

Method: Extend classical influence functions by replacing Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics estimated through stochastic-gradient MCMC, yielding a Hessian-free approach that captures higher-order interactions and scales to networks with billions of parameters.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting retraining outcomes for deep networks."

Conclusion: Local BIF provides a scalable, Hessian-free framework for influence estimation in large neural networks, facilitating better understanding of retraining effects and model behavior.

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panama is an active learning framework that trains end-to-end parametric guitar amp models (LSTM + WaveNet) by selectively sampling data via ensemble disagreement; achieves perceptual parity with NAM using only 75 datapoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data requirements for guitar-amp modeling and enable efficient virtual amp creation by leveraging end-to-end parametric models and active learning.

Method: End-to-end parametric amp modeling using a combination of LSTM and WaveNet-like architecture; ensemble-based active learning with a gradient-based objective to maximize disagreement among models, selecting the most informative datapoints (amp knob settings).

Result: MUSHRA tests show that with 75 datapoints, the models match the perceptual quality of NAM, a leading open-source non-parametric amp modeler.

Conclusion: Active learning with ensemble disagreement is effective for training parametric guitar amp models, achieving competitive perceptual quality with substantially fewer datapoints than non-parametric approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like
architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples
that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match

### [465] [Importance of localized dilatation and distensibility in identifying determinants of thoracic aortic aneurysm with neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26576)
*David S. Li,Somdatta Goswami,Qianying Cao,Vivek Oommen,Roland Assi,Jay D. Humphrey,George E. Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A finite‑element study creates many synthetic thoracic aortic aneurysms from elastic fiber damage and mechanosensing impairment, then trains neural networks to infer the initiating insult from full-field maps of dilatation and distensibility; UNet performs best and distensibility data improve prediction, supporting comprehensive mechanobiological measurements for personalized risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAAs arise from diverse mechanical and mechanobiological disruptions; understanding the interacting factors driving progression is essential for risk prediction and personalized treatment. The study addresses the lack of standardized subject-specific modeling and evaluates whether including distensibility (not just geometry) improves ability to identify the initiating insults.

Method: Use a finite element framework to generate hundreds of synthetic TAAs with varying degrees of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. Create spatial maps of local dilatation and distensibility. Train neural networks (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, Laplace Neural Operators) across multiple input formats to predict the initiating combined insult. Compare performance using geometric data alone (dilatation) versus combined geometric and mechanical data (dilatation+distensibility).

Result: Prediction errors are higher when networks are trained with dilatation data alone. Adding distensibility improves predictive performance across architectures. UNet consistently yields the highest accuracy across data formats.

Conclusion: Full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility are crucial to uncover mechanobiological drivers of TAA and to enable personalized treatment strategies. The work also proposes a standardization for future subject-specific modeling.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

### [466] [Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26578)
*Zheng Zhang,Ziwei Shan,Kaitao Song,Yexin Li,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRM frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process with per-step rewards conditioned on past steps and linked to the final outcome, addressing credit assignment and temporal causality, and showing robustness to reward hacking with superior performance across decoding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) treat steps in isolation or fail to align step rewards with the final answer, leading to poor credit attribution and vulnerability to reward hacking. There is a need to capture inter-step dependencies and causal relationships to guide reasoning reliably.

Method: Model rewards as conditional probabilities: reward of a step depends on previous steps and the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. Enforce conditional probability rules to capture causal relationships and enable precise attribution of each intermediate step to the outcome. The probabilistic framework facilitates cross-sample reward comparison and applies across Best-of-N, beam search, and reinforcement learning.

Result: CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models across Best-of-N sampling, beam search, and reinforcement learning. It is more robust to reward hacking and yields stable downstream improvements without requiring verifiable ground-truth rewards.

Conclusion: CRM provides a principled probabilistic framework for LLM reasoning that resolves credit assignment ambiguity, respects temporal causality, and improves robustness and performance across decoding strategies without relying on ground-truth rewards.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

*Alexander Fishkov,Kajetan Schweighofer,Mykyta Ielanskyi,Nikita Kotelevskii,Mohsen Guizani,Maxim Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified regression UQ framework based on proper scoring rules (CRPS, log, squared, quadratic). Derives closed-form uncertainty measures under practical parametric assumptions, estimable via ensembles, decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic components, and connected to predictive variance and differential entropy. Empirically evaluated to guide measure selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for regression is less developed than for classification; robust, calibrated UQ is crucial for safety-critical decisions; extend proper scoring rule-based UQ to regression.

Method: Develop closed-form uncertainty measures grounded in proper scoring rules under practical parametric assumptions; estimate them using ensembles; decompose into aleatoric and epistemic parts; show that the framework subsumes existing measures like predictive variance and differential entropy.

Result: Broad empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world regression datasets; provides guidance for selecting reliable UQ measures and demonstrates that the proposed framework recovers popular regression UQ measures.

Conclusion: Offers a unified, principled approach to regression UQ based on scoring rules, enabling principled measure selection and ensemble-based estimation; extends the applicability of scoring-rule UQ to regression.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time compute strategy that blends parallel and sequential reasoning by iteratively aggregating subsets of candidate chains to refine solutions; demonstrates strong gains across tasks and model families, and shows promise with aggregation-aware RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize inference-time compute benefits by leveraging reasoning chain information and bootstrapping from partial steps, addressing the limitations of purely parallel or purely sequential scaling in LLMs.

Method: RSA maintains a population of candidate reasoning chains; in each iteration, it aggregates subsets of the population to produce an improved set; the improved chains become the pool for the next iteration; combines parallel and sequential scaling. It also experiments with aggregation-aware reinforcement learning to train the model to produce more effective aggregations.

Result: RSA yields substantial performance gains as compute budgets increase across diverse tasks, models, and sizes; enables smaller models to match larger models; outperforms purely parallel and sequential strategies on benchmarks including AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA.

Conclusion: RSA is an effective test-time scaling technique that leverages information in intermediate reasoning steps; aggregation-aware RL can provide additional gains; code is available for reproduction.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttnRL introduces attention-guided branching and adaptive sampling for Process-Supervised RL (PSRL) to improve reasoning in LLMs, achieving better performance and training/sampling efficiency on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSRL often suffers from limited exploration efficiency in both branching and sampling. Observations show steps with high attention scores align with reasoning behaviors, suggesting targeted exploration can be more productive.

Method: Develop AttnRL: branch from positions with high attention; implement adaptive sampling that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size to keep non-zero advantage values; deploy a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL to boost efficiency.

Result: Empirical results on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show AttnRL consistently outperforms prior PSRL approaches in performance as well as sampling and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Attention-guided, adaptive exploration via AttnRL offers an effective and efficient PSRL framework for reasoning models, with strong results on math benchmarks and potential applicability to broader reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

*Shangding Gu,Xiaohan Wang,Donghao Ying,Haoyu Zhao,Runing Yang,Ming Jin,Boyi Li,Marco Pavone,Serena Yeung-Levy,Jun Wang,Dawn Song,Costas Spanos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AccidentBench is a large-scale multimodal benchmark that merges accident-related traffic scenes with safety-critical domains in air and water to test temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning. It contains ~2000 videos and ~19,000 human-annotated QA pairs across varying lengths and difficulty. State-of-the-art models score roughly 18% on the hardest tasks, revealing substantial gaps in real-world reasoning. The dataset and code are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for rigorous evaluation of understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world settings. Existing benchmarks do not adequately stress temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning under realistic variability. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with broader safety-critical domains (air and water), AccidentBench provides a comprehensive, physically grounded testbed to evaluate multimodal models.

Method: Construct a dataset combining accident-centric traffic scenarios with Beyond-domain safety-critical contexts. Collect ~2000 videos and generate ~19,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs across multiple video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard). Design tasks to probe temporal, spatial, and intent understanding and reasoning. Provide evaluation protocol and baseline results using state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5). Release code and dataset publicly.

Result: Evaluation shows state-of-the-art models achieving only about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, indicating substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning. AccidentBench successfully exposes these critical gaps.

Conclusion: AccidentBench provides a comprehensive, physically grounded benchmark for evaluating multimodal models in safety-critical, real-world scenarios. It aims to drive the development of safer, more robust models aligned with real-world safety challenges and offers public access to data and code.

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

*João Vitorino,Eva Maia,Isabel Praça,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPATA provides privacy-preserving, deterministic data representation for robustness evaluation and explanations in tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable external verification of AI models with confidential data and critical infrastructure, reducing privacy risk while increasing transparency.

Method: Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA) converts tabular data into a domain-independent representation of statistical patterns, projecting each instance into a discrete space to create non-leaking data cards; the process is deterministic.

Result: Projected datasets can be used to evaluate how features affect model robustness and to generate interpretable explanations without exposing raw data.

Conclusion: SPATA advances trustworthy AI by enabling external validation and transparent analysis without disclosing private datasets.

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.
