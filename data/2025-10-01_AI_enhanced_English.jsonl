However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint.

While graph-based\nANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by\nthe available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory\nusage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still\nsuffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage\nI/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant\nI/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.\n  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN\nintroduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with\nphysical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O\noperations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a\nco-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique\nto store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding\nunnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management\nstrategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data\nallocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency\nand storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving\n1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different\ndatasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "PageANN is a disk-based ANNS framework that maps graph nodes to SSD pages via a page-node graph, uses a merged disk layout with representative vectors to reduce I/O, and employs light indexing plus coordinated memory-disk allocation to boost throughput and lower latency while preserving recall.", "motivation": "Disk-based ANNS suffer from long I/O traversal, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, which bottleneck scalability for large-scale vector search.", "method": "Introduce a page-node graph where similar vectors are clustered into page nodes and the physical SSD pages align with graph nodes.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence.
