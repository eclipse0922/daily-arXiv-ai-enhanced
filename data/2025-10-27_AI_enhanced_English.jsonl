Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework.

Our analysis reveals that the solver\nnaturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary\ndetectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features\nresponding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric\npartitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what\nneural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric\nstructure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward\ntransparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic\ninterpretability.
