### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2 is a unified multimodal retrieval model that handles image+text queries and documents, using a multi-layer recurrent Transformer with LSTM-inspired gating; it achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR with faster inference and lower memory, and improves downstream tasks when used in retrieval-augmented generation; code is public.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on task-specific fine-tuning and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. A unified, efficient model for multimodal retrieval is needed to support complex multimodal queries and collections.

Method: Proposes ReT-2 with multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture that uses LSTM-inspired gating to dynamically fuse information across layers and modalities. Evaluated on M2KR and M-BEIR across various retrieval configurations; integrates into RAG pipelines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance across diverse settings on M2KR and M-BEIR, with faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches; improves downstream Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek when used in retrieval-augmented generation.

Conclusion: ReT-2 provides a unified, scalable solution for multimodal retrieval, enabling efficient retrieval across multimodal corpora and boosting downstream LLM-based tasks; source code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision Diffusion Model (VDM)–based feature extractor, aggregated by a transformer, improves action recognition generalization across species, viewpoints, and contexts; conditioning on earlier diffusion timesteps emphasizes semantic content over pixel details; achieves state-of-the-art on three challenging generalization benchmarks; code and project page provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models struggle to generalize across large context and viewpoint variations (cross-species, egocentric/third-person, real-life vs. movie contexts). Improving robustness to such variations is a key goal for human-like recognition.

Method: Extract features from a Vision Diffusion Model and aggregate them with a transformer. An ablation shows conditioning the diffusion process on earlier timesteps highlights semantic information over pixel-level details. Evaluate on cross-species, cross-viewpoint, and cross-context action classification tasks.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three generalization benchmarks for action recognition across species, viewing angles, and recording contexts.

Conclusion: VDM-derived features, when pooled/weighted by a transformer and conditioned on early diffusion timesteps, yield robust, human-like generalization in action recognition across diverse contexts; the approach is supported by public code and project resources.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard is a modular prompting framework featuring VulnGuard Prompt, a data-driven, contrastive-learning-based method to proactively block harmful outputs at generation time, using six modules and theoretical guarantees of harm reduction (~25-30%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful, biased, or misleading content affecting vulnerable groups; existing post-hoc safety methods are insufficient. A proactive, source-level mechanism with formal optimization and multi-objective guarantees is proposed.

Method: A hybrid prompting approach combining few-shot examples from curated GitHub data, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting within a six-module architecture (Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, User-System Interaction). It uses multi-objective optimization with entropy-based analyses and formal proofs to achieve Pareto-optimal harm reduction.

Result: Claims a 25-30% reduction in analytical harm via entropy bounds and Pareto optimality, along with convergence proofs and vulnerability analysis. Provides a theoretical validation framework and GitHub-sourced datasets for empirical testing.

Conclusion: Establishes mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research and positions PromptGuard as an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention, with six-core-module orchestration.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beta-SOD: a Beta mixture outlier detector for Siamese Re-ID that denoises noisy labels by modeling pairwise cosine similarities with a two-component Beta distribution, improving robustness on person and vehicle Re-ID under 10–30% label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise severely degrades Re-ID performance. Reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task with an outlier detection (OD) step aims to identify and mitigate noisy pairs before or during learning, improving robustness and generalization.

Method: A Siamese network for embedding with a Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection (Beta-SOD) that models cosine-similarity distributions with a two-component Beta distribution mixture; an identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions ensures a well-posed learning task; training uses a combination of binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses; OD identifies outlier pairs to de-noise labels.

Result: Beta-SOD improves de-noising and Re-ID performance across datasets (CUHK03, Market-1501 for persons; VeRi-776 for vehicles) under noise levels 10–30%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: Beta-SOD provides a robust, broadly applicable framework for noisy Re-ID by probabilistically detecting outliers in pairwise similarities, leveraging a two-Beta identifiability model to keep learning well-posed and effective across person and vehicle Re-ID tasks.

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection framework that uses curvature-aware structural enhancement (CASE) in the encoder and progressive high-frequency perception (PHFP) with wavelet-based refinement in the decoder, achieving superior segmentation metrics and stenosis detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) images have low contrast, high noise, and fine vascular structures, which challenge accurate segmentation and stenosis detection. The study aims to improve accuracy by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space long-range dependencies, and frequency-domain detail enhancement.

Method: An end-to-end network (SFD-Mamba2Net) with an encoder that includes a CASE module to leverage multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vessels and suppressing background, and a decoder with a PHFP module that uses multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global structures. The framework also incorporates state-space-based long-range dependency modeling and frequency-domain enhancement strategies.

Result: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics and achieved the highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net effectively improves the accuracy of ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection by combining multi-scale structural priors, long-range dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement.

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated MRI-based framework for predicting survival after colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) surgery using segmentation (with promptable foundation models and a new zero-shot 3D prompt propagation SAMONAI) and radiomics analyzed by SurvAMINN, achieving substantial performance gains on a 227-patient dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic models for CRLM are limited and often rely on restricted clinical or molecular features, providing insufficient predictive power for multifocal disease. There is a need for annotation-efficient, accurate, and interpretable prediction frameworks that integrate pre- and post-contrast imaging and robust survival analysis.

Method: The approach combines a segmentation pipeline that handles partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to fill missing labels; introduces SAMONAI, a zero-shot 3D prompt propagation algorithm based on the Segment Anything Model for efficient ROI segmentation from a single point prompt; a radiomics pipeline extracts features from each tumor on pre- and post-contrast MRI; Survival prediction is performed by SurvAMINN, an autoencoder-based multiple-instance neural network that performs dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction on right-censored data focusing on the most aggressive tumors.

Result: Evaluation on an institutional dataset of 227 patients shows the framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers, with a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. The framework delivers annotation-efficient, interpretable, and accurate outcome predictions for CRLM.

Conclusion: Automating segmentation and leveraging radiomics for survival analysis can significantly improve CRLM prognostication, especially in multifocal disease, and has the potential to supplement or outperform current biomarkers while reducing annotation burden.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CompCon, an evolutionary algorithm to discover visual attribute divergences between two text-to-image models and links prompts to these divergences; creates ID2 dataset of 60 prompt-dependent differences and shows model-specific traits (e.g., PixArt loneliness with wet streets; Stable Diffusion 3.5 with African American people in media professions); code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and when different generative visual models encode different visual attributes, and to map the prompt concepts that trigger cross-model divergences.

Method: Proposes CompCon, an evolutionary search algorithm that finds attributes more prevalent in one model's outputs than another and links these attributes to prompt concepts. Builds an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2 (60 input-dependent differences). Compares against several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Applies to popular text-to-image models and analyzes discovered divergences.

Result: CompCon successfully uncovers diverging visual attributes and associated prompt concepts between models. The ID2 dataset supports automated evaluation of divergence. Notable divergences include PixArt depicting loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicting African American people in media professions. Code is available at the stated GitHub repository.

Conclusion: CompCon provides an effective framework for identifying and interpreting divergent representations across text-to-image models, enabling more informed comparisons and responsible model deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [8] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based pipeline using U-Net to identify cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS imagery and correct them to improve water-quality estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS remote sensing corrupt data; correcting them enables more reliable water-quality analysis and broader utility of UAS imagery under cloudy conditions.

Method: Pixel-level labeling of cloud shadows and sun glint; train U-Net model to segment obstructed regions; evaluate with multiple metrics; determine best training settings; develop a high-quality image correction model to recover the obstructed regions.

Result: The approach yields a trained model capable of identifying cloud-shadow and sun-glint regions and a correction model to recover these areas in images; evaluation metrics guided selection of best settings; demonstrates feasibility for improved downstream water-quality parameter estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables effective use of UAS imagery in cloudy conditions by detecting and correcting cloud shadows and sun glint, enhancing the reliability of water-quality assessments from UAS data.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin combines local convolutional feature learning with hierarchical shifted-window ViT attention to boost small-dataset vision performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs excel at global context but struggle to capture local details on small datasets due to missing locality and translation equivariance; incorporate local bias to improve generalization.

Method: Augment each attention block of hierarchical shifted-window attention with a learnable local feature enhancement module to fuse local and global features.

Result: Consistent gains over state-of-the-art conv and transformer models on CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, SVHN, Tiny ImageNet; e.g., +2.17% (CIFAR-10), +4.92% (CIFAR-100), +0.10% (MNIST), +0.26% (SVHN), +4.47% (Tiny ImageNet) over Swin Transformer baseline.

Conclusion: Local-global feature fusion is effective for improving generalization/robustness of vision transformers on small-scale data; code and weights released.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher is a fully differentiable framework for feature matching in point cloud registration that combines local graph-based initialization, bilateral refinement, and global geometric consistency to predict pointwise matches, achieving state-of-the-art inlier ratios on KITTI, KITTI-360, and 3DMatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust 3D point cloud registration requires reliable, differentiable feature matching that respects local geometry and global consistency, performing well across outdoor/indoor data and partial overlaps.

Method: 1) Local graph embedding to initialize a score (matching) matrix; 2) Repositioning step refining the matrix via bilateral source-to-target and target-to-source nearest-neighbor matching in 3D space; 3) Stack paired features and apply global geometric consistency learning to predict per-point matching probabilities.

Result: Evaluated on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch) datasets, as well as 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial matching (MVP-RG); achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios: 95–97% on KITTI, 94–97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings and improved rigid registration performance.

Conclusion: iMatcher is a fully differentiable, robust feature-matching framework that leverages local and global geometric consistency to produce high-quality correspondences for 3D registration, achieving superior inlier ratios across challenging datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

### [11] [UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991)
*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON introduces an occupancy-based implicit representation for 3D ultrasound reconstruction, leveraging acoustic features from B-mode images to enable weakly-supervised, multiview optimization, addressing occlusions and annotation dependence while improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free-hand ultrasound requires integrating partial 2D views into 3D anatomy; implicit representations can help but depend on annotations and suffer from view-dependency and shadowing. Exploit acoustic information to improve robustness and reduce annotation cost.

Method: Propose UltrON, an occupancy-based representation; extract acoustic features from B-mode images without extra annotation; introduce a loss that compensates for view-dependency; optimize occupancy from multiview ultrasound; demonstrate generalization across shapes within the same anatomy.

Result: UltrON mitigates occlusions and sparse labeling, yielding more accurate 3D reconstructions; code and dataset will be released.

Conclusion: Incorporating acoustic properties into occupancy-based implicit representations enhances geometric consistency, robustness to occlusion, and generalization for ultrasound 3D reconstruction under weak supervision.

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

*Andrew Bell,Yan Kit Choi,Steffen Peterson,Andrew King,Muhummad Sohaib Nazir,Alistair Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An INR-based method conditioned on latent codes predicts continuous LV displacement from tagged MRI without inference-time optimization, achieving state-of-the-art tracking and strain accuracy on 452 UK Biobank cases while being ~380x faster than the best baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic, accurate, and scalable quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI is challenging; large datasets like UK Biobank require fast, reliable methods that do not rely on costly inference-time optimization.

Method: An implicit neural representation (INR) conditioned on learned latent codes predicts continuous left ventricular displacement from tagging MRI. The model avoids inference-time optimization and is evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, compared against three deep learning baselines.

Result: Best tracking accuracy with 2.14 mm RMSE; lowest combined strain error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain; ~380× faster than the most accurate baseline.

Conclusion: INR-based models are suitable for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet) introduces a dynamic weighting of OEM in Universal Domain Adaptation, improving known/unknown discrimination and achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In UniDA, treating all one-vs-all classifiers equally dilutes learning signal; focusing adaptation on relevant class boundaries per target sample can improve open-set/partial-set recognition.

Method: Integrates a dynamic weighting strategy into Open-set Entropy Minimization across a bank of classifiers, leveraging closed-set predictions to weight boundaries, sharpening separation between known/unknown.

Result: Empirical results on Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, ImageCLEF show higher average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF; outperforms MLNet in most tasks (22/31 OP-DA, 19/31 Open-Set DA).

Conclusion: Dynamic weighted OEM in E-MLNet yields more focused adaptation and robustness, validating the proposed strategy for UniDA.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

### [14] [COCO-Urdu: A Large-Scale Urdu Image-Caption Dataset with Multimodal Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09014)
*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu is a large-scale Urdu image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, with 59k images and 319k Urdu captions, created to reduce language bias in multimodal research; it uses SeamlessM4T v2 for translation, a hybrid quality estimation pipeline (COMET-Kiwi, CLIP similarity, BERTScore with back-translation), and iterative refinement with open-source LLMs; benchmarked with BLEU, SacreBLEU, chrF; claims to be the largest publicly available Urdu caption dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu is under-served in multimodal/vision-language research; there is a lack of large-scale, high-quality Urdu datasets, which biases multilingual models toward high-resource languages.

Method: Create COCO-Urdu by translating MS COCO captions with SeamlessM4T v2; select 59k images with 319k captions via stratified sampling to preserve original distribution; validate captions with a hybrid quality estimation framework combining translation quality (COMET-Kiwi), visual grounding (CLIP-based similarity), and semantic consistency (BERTScore with back-translation); iteratively refine low-scoring captions using open-source large language models; benchmark using BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF.

Result: Reported consistently strong results on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF; COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset to date; releasing both the dataset and the quality estimation pipeline to reduce language bias in multimodal research.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu provides a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems by offering a large, quality-filtered Urdu dataset and a reproducible quality estimation pipeline; aims to enable more equitable multilingual vision-language research.

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Motivation: Current fMRI-based visual decoding often requires subject-specific training, hindering scalability. There is a need for scalable, multi-subject models that can generalize across subjects while remaining parameter-efficient.

Method: Introduce VoxelFormer, a lightweight transformer integrating ToMer (Token Merging Transformer) for efficient voxel compression and a query-driven Q-Former that yields fixed-size neural representations aligned with CLIP image embeddings. Train and evaluate on the 7T Natural Scenes Dataset with multi-subject training.

Result: VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects included in training and uses significantly fewer parameters than existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of token merging and query-based transformers for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

Conclusion: Token merging and query-based transformers are promising strategies for scalable, parameter-efficient neural decoding from fMRI, enabling effective multi-subject training for visual decoding.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects

### [16] [Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054)
*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), a diffusion-based framework with anatomical priors to generate anatomically plausible counterfactual 3D brain MRIs, preserving subtle regional variations; shows improved image quality and that measurements from counterfactuals align with known disease effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D brain MRI studies aim to detect subtle morphometric differences; counterfactual image generation could reduce MRI costs, but current models struggle to preserve fine-grained anatomy due to training focusing on overall image realism rather than preserving local variations. Explicit voxel-level anatomical priors could address this.

Method: PCGM uses a probabilistic graph module to encode anatomical constraints and translate them into 3D spatial masks indicating regions with subtle variations. These masks feed into a 3D extension of ControlNet to guide a specialized counterfactual denoising UNet, whose representations are decoded by a 3D diffusion decoder to synthesize high-quality brain MRIs.

Result: PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baselines across multiple datasets; measurements derived from PCGM counterfactuals reproduce disease-related effects on cortical regions as reported in neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a milestone for synthetic MRIs enabling studies of subtle morphological differences; the approach improves anatomical plausibility and utility of counterfactual MRIs in neuroscience research.

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med3DInsight fuses 3D image encoders with 2D multimodal large language models via a plane-slice-aware transformer and a partial optimal transport alignment to enable self-supervised, annotation-free 3D medical understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results on CT/MRI segmentation and classification and offering simple integration into existing 3D networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical understanding via SSL is hampered by limited semantic depth; 2D MLLMs offer rich textual semantics, but directly applying them to 3D volumes is challenging. The work aims to bring 2D MLLM knowledge into 3D medical understanding while tolerating noise from LLM-generated content.

Method: Pretrain a framework that couples 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs using a plane-slice-aware transformer module; apply partial optimal transport-based alignment to align modalities, enabling robustness to LLM noise; no human annotations required; evaluate on segmentation and classification tasks across CT/MRI datasets; provides integration path into existing 3D networks; release code and pretrained models.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on segmentation and classification for CT and MRI datasets in downstream tasks, outperforming prior SSL methods; shows robustness to noise in LLM outputs; scalable and annotation-free; results reported on public datasets.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, multimodal 3D medical representation learning paradigm that leverages 2D MLLMs without human annotations, with strong empirical performance and easy integration into existing systems; code and datasets forthcoming.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,
and pre-trained models will be available at

*Hesham M. Shehata,Mohammad Abdolrahmani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task learning approach that integrates fixed environmental object information with skeleton-based GCNs improves human-object interaction recognition, achieving 99.25% accuracy and outperforming skeleton-only baselines by 2.75%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN-based action recognition using human skeletons struggles with human–object interactions due to insufficient scene representation; incorporating fixed environmental objects and multi-task learning aims to enhance interaction detection.

Method: Collect real-world data from public environments; define interaction classes (hands-on fixed objects) and non-interaction classes (walking/standing); develop a multi-task learning architecture that uses both skeleton pose information and interaction-area/environmental cues to recognize interactions.

Result: The proposed approach achieves 99.25% accuracy on the studied interaction tasks, surpassing the skeleton-only base model by 2.75%.

Conclusion: Integrating fixed-object/environmental information through multi-task learning improves human–object interaction recognition in GCN-based action recognition, demonstrating effectiveness on real-world data and suggesting directions for richer scene representations.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

*Jifeng Shen,Haibo Zhan,Xin Zuo,Heng Fan,Xiaohui Yuan,Jun Li,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces IRDFusion, a cross-modal feature fusion framework with Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) to improve multispectral object detection by mitigating background noise through iterative relation-map guidance; reports state-of-the-art results on FLIR, LLVIP, and M3FD; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral detection methods often retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. There is a need for adaptive, discriminative fusion that emphasizes object-aware, cross-modal information while suppressing shared background across modalities.

Method: Two novel modules: (1) Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) that models intra- and inter-modal feature relationships to improve cross-modal alignment and discriminative power; (2) Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) that computes inter-modal differential features and feeds them back to MFRM as guidance signals. These are integrated into an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism (IRDFusion) that iteratively amplifies salient relational signals while suppressing noise, enabling high-quality cross-modal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP, and M3FD datasets show state-of-the-art performance with consistent improvements over existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: The IRDFusion framework provides robust, adaptive cross-modal fusion for multispectral detection by leveraging feedback-driven differential guidance. It achieves superior performance and generalization, with code available at the authors' GitHub repository.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA offers a structured, training-free approach to jointly quantize and prune tokens in Vision-Language-Action models, achieving ~1.93× speedup and up to 4.5% average success-rate gains while preserving core performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are highly capable but incur heavy computation and memory costs, hindering deployment. Existing compression methods (quantization or token pruning) are used ad-hoc and often incompatible, failing to deliver holistic efficiency gains.

Method: Introduce SQAP-VLA, a structured, training-free inference acceleration framework that co-designs quantization and token pruning. Develop quantization-aware token pruning criteria that operate on aggressively quantized models and enhance the quantizer design to improve pruning effectiveness, enabling simultaneous acceleration.

Result: When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA delivers significant improvements in computational efficiency and inference speed, while preserving core model performance, achieving a ~1.93× speedup and up to a 4.5% average improvement in success rate over the original model.

Conclusion: This work presents the first structured, training-free framework that enables simultaneous quantization and token pruning for VLA models by co-designing the two components to address their incompatibility, demonstrating practical efficiency gains on standard VLA architectures.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic open-set detection framework for embedding-based UAV detectors that enhances unknown object rejection and resilience to corrupted flight data by entropy-based semantic uncertainty in the embedding space, aided by spectral normalization and temperature scaling; validated on the AOT benchmark and real flights with up to ~10% relative AUROC gains over YOLO baselines and with stronger background rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-set detectors struggle under domain shifts and data corruption, risking safety in UAV air-to-air perception; there is a need for reliable open-set handling that preserves robustness.

Method: A model-agnostic open-set framework for embedding-based detectors that explicitly handles unknown object rejection. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in the embedding space and uses spectral normalization and temperature scaling to sharpen open-set discrimination. It also leverages background rejection to boost robustness, validated on AOT and real flight tests.

Result: Demonstrates up to 10% relative AUROC improvement over standard YOLO-based detectors; ablations show consistent gains; background rejection enhances robustness without harming detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed open-set framework improves recognition of unknown objects for embedding-based UAV detectors and remains robust to corrupted flight data, making UAV perception more reliable in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduces the dependency on costly ground-truth pose data (GPS/odometry) for training LiDAR global localization, enabling scalable SLAM with loop closure and re-localization.

Method: Construct training triplets from single BEV images by exploiting known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV patches; extract local features with CNN; aggregate into global descriptors with NetVLAD; apply SoftCos loss to improve triplet learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global localization on KITTI and NCLT, with scalability advantages over supervised methods.

Conclusion: A scalable, self-supervised BEV-based framework for LiDAR global localization that reduces labeling cost and can enhance SLAM robustness.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Motivation: Reduce road accidents caused by distracted/ impaired driving and address limitations of V2V-based systems by leveraging external observation to monitor non-connected vehicles in real-time.

Method: A computer-vision pipeline employing real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. Uses YOLO for object detection and custom lane-estimation algorithms to quantify unsafe behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectories.

Result: Demonstrates reliability and adaptability across diverse video datasets and environmental/road conditions, indicating robustness of the vision-based approach.

Conclusion: A non-communicating-vehicle vision-based framework can effectively identify unsafe driving behaviors and complement or replace reliance on inter-vehicular communication for driver-state assessment.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.

Motivation: Existing generic benchmarks miss the nuanced context of human–device interactions, such as faces, hands, and phones under occlusion and scale variation. A dedicated dataset is needed to enable safe, productive, and attention-aware vision systems in real-world scenarios.

Method: Construct FPI-Det by collecting diverse images across four domains and annotating synchronized faces and phones. Provide extreme scale variation and occlusions. Evaluate representative detectors (YOLO and DETR) to establish baselines and analyze performance by object size, occlusion level, and environment. Release source code and dataset at the specified GitHub link.

Conclusion: FPI-Det fills a gap in benchmarks for fine-grained human–device interactions, enabling the development of more context-aware vision systems for safety, productivity, and attention management. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg proposes a zero-shot hierarchical segmentation method for rosette-shaped plants from top-view images. It combines leaf-instance segmentation from a foundation model with a vision-language model to reason about plant structure, enabling identification of whole plant individuals without training data. It outperforms existing zero-shot methods and shows strong cross-domain performance, even matching or exceeding some supervised approaches. Code is available online.


<details>

Result: Evaluations across diverse plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments show that ZeroPlantSeg surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods.

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg enables zero-shot hierarchical segmentation of rosette-shaped plants from top-view images by fusing leaf-level segmentation with structural reasoning, reducing annotation needs and broadening cross-domain applicability. Implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Event is a large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding on event camera data in real driving scenes, featuring attribute-enriched referring expressions to enable interpretable, compositional grounding in dynamic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide microsecond-precision changes and are robust to motion blur, but there is a lack of benchmarks integrating this modality with natural language understanding. A language-grounding benchmark for event data is needed to enable contextual reasoning in dynamic scenes.

Method: Introduce Talk2Event as the first large-scale language-grounding benchmark for event data. Built on real-world driving scenarios, it comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and over 30,000 validated referring expressions. Each expression is annotated with four structured attributes—appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects—capturing spatial, temporal, and relational cues to support interpretable and compositional grounding.

Result: The dataset provides statistics and an attribute-centric design that enables interpretable language grounding and compositional reasoning in dynamic scenes, establishing a valuable resource for multimodal, temporally-aware perception in driving contexts.

Conclusion: Talk2Event lays a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware perception, with applications in robotics, human-AI interaction, and beyond, and enables analyses that go beyond simple object recognition to contextual reasoning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

### [27] [Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic Framework for Robust Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09118)
*Tianlu Zheng,Yifan Zhang,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Kaicheng Yang,Qichuan Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-based method for person representation that combines noise-resistant data curation (WebPerson: 5M image-text pairs curated with LLMs) and a gradient-attention guided dual-masking framework (GA-DMS) to improve cross-modal alignment and fine-grained semantics, plus masked token prediction. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address (1) the scarcity of large-scale, person-centric vision-language data and (2) the limitations of global contrastive learning, which can lose local discriminative features and be sensitive to noisy text.

Method: (1) Build WebPerson by using in-context learning of multilingual LLMs to filter and caption web images, yielding ~5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. (2) Propose GA-DMS: adaptively mask noisy textual tokens via gradient-attention similarity; include masked token prediction objectives to enforce informative tokens and enhance fine-grained semantic representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GA-DMS demonstrates that combining LLM-assisted data curation with gradient-attention guided dual-masking improves CLIP-based person representation, enabling stronger cross-modal alignment and finer-grained semantic understanding.

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

### [28] [ALL-PET: A Low-resource and Low-shot PET Foundation Model in the Projection Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09130)
*Bin Huang,Kang Chen,Bingxuan Li,Huafeng Liu,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET is a low-resource, low-shot PET diffusion-model operating in the projection domain, using Radon mask augmentation, dynamic multi-mask, mask constraints, and transparent medical attention to generate high-quality sinograms from ~500 samples and generalize to multiple PET tasks with memory under 24GB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET foundation modeling is constrained by scarce labeled data and limited compute. A projection-domain approach with data-efficient augmentation, geometry-consistent constraints, and lesion-focused, interpretable attention could enable versatile, scalable models that respect acquisition physics.

Method: A latent diffusion model runs in the sinogram (projection) domain. Key innovations: RMAS—project random image-domain masks into sinograms to create >200k diverse training samples; DMM—dynamically vary mask quantity/distribution; positive/negative mask constraints—enforce geometric consistency; TMA—parameter-free, geometry-driven attention highlighting lesion areas, projected into sinogram space, with optional clinician-adjusted ROI customization.

Result: ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only ~500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. It generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, while maintaining memory usage under 24GB.

Conclusion: A resource-efficient, projection-domain foundation model for PET that leverages geometry-aware data augmentation, explicit mask constraints, and interpretable lesion-guided attention to deliver versatile, high-quality results with limited data and hardware.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

### [29] [Noise-Robust Topology Estimation of 2D Image Data via Neural Networks and Persistent Homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09140)
*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANNs can outperform a standard PH pipeline for estimating Betti numbers in noisy 2D binary images, suggesting learned priors help topology inference when data are noisy; PH remains common but ANN is a promising alternative under structural noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly compare noise robustness of an ANN-based Betti-number predictor with a PH pipeline using cubical complexes and SEDT, across synthetic and real-world data.

Method: Train a supervised ANN to predict Betti numbers from 2D binary images; compare against a PH pipeline (cubical complexes + Signed Euclidean Distance Transform) on one synthetic and two real datasets; evaluate performance under noise.

Result: The ANN approach outperforms the PH pipeline under noise, likely due to the model learning contextual and geometric priors; ANNs show potential as a noise-robust topology estimator.

Conclusion: ANNs offer a compelling, albeit emerging, alternative to PH for topology estimation under structural noise; they can complement PH methods as a robustness-enhanced approach.

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

### [30] [Objectness Similarity: Capturing Object-Level Fidelity in 3D Scene Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09143)
*Yuiko Uchida,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSIM is an object-centric 3D scene evaluation metric that uses object detection features to quantify 'objectness' per object, aligning better with human perception than traditional metrics; it enables standardized evaluation of 3D reconstruction/generation with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image/3D scene metrics assess global quality and often misalign with human perception. Given that human scene understanding is object-centric, there is a need for an evaluation metric that emphasizes objects as the fundamental perceptual units.

Method: Leverage an object detection model to identify objects in 3D scenes and extract their feature representations. Compute an object-level 'objectness' score for each object, then aggregate to form OSIM. Validate by a user study showing better alignment with human perception, perform analyses of OSIM characteristics, and re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction/generation models under a standardized setup. Code is released at the provided URL.

Result: OSIM showed closer alignment to human perception than existing metrics in the user study. The paper also provides analyses of OSIM’s characteristics and demonstrates standardized re-evaluations of recent 3D reconstruction/generation models to clarify field progress.

Conclusion: OSIM offers an object-centric evaluation framework for 3D scenes that better matches human perception, enabling fairer comparisons and deeper insights into advancements in 3D reconstruction and generation; the authors release code for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dataset-driven survey linking video data characteristics to architectural choices, offering a practical framework and roadmap for general-purpose video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surveys miss how datasets shape inductive biases and architectures; understanding these pressures is crucial for scalable, effective video models.

Method: Literature synthesis across milestones (two-stream, 3D CNNs, sequential models, transformers, multimodal models) framed as responses to dataset pressures; proposes a unifying framework linking datasets, biases, and architectures; provides practical design guidance.

Result: Introduces a dataset-driven lens, reconciling milestones with data pressures; yields actionable guidance and a prescriptive roadmap for model design under dataset invariances.

Conclusion: Unifies datasets, inductive biases, and architectures to guide the next generation of general-purpose video understanding.

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023 investigates multi-scale cell-tissue interactions for overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation in WSIs; top methods show ~7.99 F1-point gains over cell-only baselines on TCGA-derived data, underscoring the value of multi-scale semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the hypothesis that modeling cell–tissue interactions across magnifications improves performance beyond cell-only approaches and to spur progress via a shared dataset.

Method: Comparative analysis of participant approaches from the OCELOT 2023 challenge; evaluation on a dataset of 673 cell-tissue pairs from 306 TCGA WSIs across six organs; emphasis on strategies that fuse multi-scale contexts and handle overlapping annotations.

Result: Participants achieved up to 7.99 higher F1-score on the test set relative to a baseline cell-only model; the results suggest substantial gains from incorporating cell–tissue relationships and multi-scale semantics.

Conclusion: Multi-scale, cell–tissue-aware models are crucial for near-human performance in histology analysis; the challenge dataset highlights the need for and benefits of joint cell-tissue modeling and overlapping annotation datasets.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

*Yuan Shufang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-DETR++ strengthens the RT-DETR encoder for UAV object detection by introducing a channel-gated AU/AD upsampling/downsampling path and CSP-PAC feature fusion, improving small object detection and dense scenes in real time without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV imagery presents challenges such as densely packed small objects, scale variation, and occlusion. Effective feature propagation and multi-scale fusion in the encoder/neck are crucial for accurate real-time detection.

Method: Two main enhancements: (1) channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) in the feature pyramid to minimize propagation errors and preserve details; (2) CSP-PAC (parallel hollow convolutions) during feature fusion to process local and contextual information within the same layer for multi-scale feature integration.

Result: Experimentally, RT-DETR++ achieves superior performance for small and densely packed objects while maintaining real-time speed with no increase in computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed neck/encoder enhancements offer an effective feature encoding design for real-time UAV object detection systems, improving accuracy on challenging scenes without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

### [34] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free KB-VQA framework that reduces noise and redundancy in knowledge retrieval by (1) extracting low-noise queries from image-question pairs, (2) prompting large models to extract answer-relevant segments, and (3) selectively integrating knowledge only when the model is uncertain, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge-based VQA often suffers from noisy, redundant retrieved information; a training-free approach to focus knowledge relevance and reduce redundancy can improve accuracy without fine-tuning large models.

Method: 1) generate low-noise queries from image-question pairs for retrieval; 2) use large-model prompts to extract answer-beneficial segments from retrieved knowledge; 3) selectively integrate knowledge only when the model lacks confidence; 4) operate in a training-free setting.

Result: Experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art KB-VQA methods.

Conclusion: Knowledge focusing with low-noise retrieval, targeted extraction, and selective integration yields accurate, relevant knowledge and mitigates redundancy in KB-VQA without extra training.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Yulin Tong,Fengzong Zhang,Haiqin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CWSSNet to fuse 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet-domain convolutions for hyperspectral land-cover classification, showing strong accuracy and robustness, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral data provide rich information but suffer from high dimensionality, redundancy, and spectral mixing, which hinder classification performance.

Method: CWSSNet framework that integrates 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution, using a multiscale convolutional attention module and multi-band decomposition in the wavelet domain.

Result: On ZY1F hyperspectral data for Yugan County, CWSSNet achieves mIoU 74.50%, mAcc 82.73%, mF1 84.94%; highest IoU for water, vegetation, and bare land; demonstrates robustness and near-optimal performance with 70% training data.

Conclusion: CWSSNet overcomes traditional methods' classification bottlenecks by incorporating wavelet-domain multi-band decomposition and multimodal fusion, offering robust and efficient hyperspectral classification.

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Conclusion: RRDataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for real-world robustness; highlights gaps in current AI-generated image detection; emphasizes integrating human adaptability and improved models to enhance detection under real-world conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on

### [37] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, self-adaptive ISP plugin (Dark-ISP) directly processes Bayer RAW images for low-light object detection, decomposing ISP into differentiable linear and nonlinear stages with physics-informed priors and a Self-Boost cooperative mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results with few parameters on three RAW datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light object detection suffers from degraded image quality. RAW images can offer better information than RGB, but existing approaches either lose information when converting RAW→RGB or rely on complex pipelines. There is a need for a lightweight, end-to-end trainable method that operates directly on RAW data to improve detection performance in dark environments.

Method: Decompose conventional ISP into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules, recast as differentiable components trained with task-driven losses. Equip each with content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors to produce RAW-to-RGB conversions aligned with detection. Introduce a Self-Boost mechanism leveraging the cascade structure to facilitate cooperation between sub-modules. Train end-to-end for object detection on RAW Bayer data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches on three RAW image datasets, achieving superior detection results with minimal parameter count in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: Dark-ISP demonstrates that a lightweight, self-adaptive, differentiable ISP plugin can effectively bridge RAW and RGB spaces for object detection without information loss or heavy architectures, enabling efficient end-to-end RAW-based detection in low-light settings.

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

### [39] [MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200)
*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj introduces a multi-granularity goal-guided model for human trajectory prediction that progresses from coarse to fine trajectory refinements using a transformer-based recursive refinement network, with cross-granularity weight-sharing and velocity as an auxiliary task, achieving state-of-the-art results among goal-guided methods on EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal-guided trajectory prediction reduces uncertainty and leverages prior knowledge about intended targets. Existing approaches often separate coarse goal prediction from fine-grained trajectory completion and largely ignore intermediate temporal granularity, limiting the ability to model multi-scale human dynamics.

Method: MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity. At each granularity level, a transformer-based Recursive Refinement Network (RRN) extracts features and produces progressive refinements. Features across granularities are integrated via a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is added as an auxiliary task to improve performance.

Result: MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided approaches on the EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity goal-guided modeling effectively captures diverse scales of human dynamics, and MGTraj demonstrates that integrating intermediate granularity levels with shared weights and auxiliary velocity estimation yields superior trajectory predictions.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

### [40] [Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232)
*Jiesi Hu,Jianfeng Cao,Yanwu Yang,Chenfei Ye,Yixuan Zhang,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medverse is a universal 3D medical-image in-context learning (ICL) model trained on 22 datasets to jointly handle segmentation, transformation, and enhancement. It uses a next-scale autoregressive ICL that refines from coarse to fine to produce full-resolution volumes and a blockwise cross-attention module for long-range context with sparse computation, achieving superior generalization to unseen centers, organs, species, and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL models for medical imaging struggle to simultaneously deliver high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no single model trained across diverse tasks and anatomical regions. A universal, scalable ICL model could unlock broad clinical utility across tasks and modalities.

Method: Medverse adopts a next-scale autoregressive ICL that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, producing consistent full-resolution volumetric outputs with multi-scale anatomical awareness. It introduces a blockwise cross-attention module to enable long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving efficiency via spatial sparsity. Trained on 22 datasets spanning universal segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, modalities, and clinical centers.

Result: Extensive evaluation on held-out datasets, including unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and modalities, shows Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a new paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be publicly released at the cited repository.

Conclusion: Medverse demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of a universal, task- and anatomy-agnostic 3D medical imaging ICL model, achieving high-fidelity, globally aware predictions across diverse tasks and data sources, with public availability to foster adoption and further research.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAtNeXt hybridizes CoAtNet with ConvNeXtV2 blocks and CBAM for gastric tissue image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets and outperforming CNNs and ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early gastric disease diagnosis relies on manual, labor-intensive histopathology with variability among pathologists; there is a need for automated, reliable, and efficient gastric tissue analysis.

Method: Proposes CoAtNeXt, a hybrid model built on CoAtNet by replacing MBConv with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks and integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The model is scaled for a balance between computational efficiency and performance. Evaluated on HMU-GC-HE-30K (8-class) and GasHisSDB (binary) and compared against 10 CNNs and 10 ViT models.

Result: On HMU-GC-HE-30K: accuracy 96.47%, precision 96.60%, recall 96.47%, F1 96.45%, AUC 99.89%. On GasHisSDB: accuracy 98.29%, precision 98.07%, recall 98.41%, F1 98.23%, AUC 99.90%. Outperformed all CNN and ViT baselines and prior studies.

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological gastric tissue classification, performing well in both binary and multiclass settings and offering potential to assist pathologists by improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

### [42] [Towards Better Dental AI: A Multimodal Benchmark and Instruction Dataset for Panoramic X-ray Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09254)
*Jing Hao,Yuxuan Fan,Yanpeng Sun,Kaixin Guo,Lizhuo Lin,Jinrong Yang,Qi Yong H. Ai,Lun M. Wong,Hao Tang,Kuo Feng Hung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new panoramic dental X-ray dataset (MMOral) with 20,563 images and 1.3M instruction-following instances is introduced, plus MMOral-Bench for evaluation across five diagnostic tasks. They benchmark 64 LVLMs, finding GPT-4o only reaches 41.45% accuracy, highlighting domain challenges. They propose OralGPT, a fine-tuned model via SFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B using MMOral data, achieving notable gains (e.g., 24.73% after one epoch). The work provides dataset, benchmark, and a ready-to-use pipeline to advance intelligent dentistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dentistry, especially panoramic X-ray interpretation, presents dense anatomy and subtle cues that current general-purpose LVLM benchmarks fail to capture. There is a need for domain-specific data, benchmarks, and fine-tuned models to improve diagnostic AI support in dental radiology.

Method: 1) Build MMOral: a large-scale multimodal instruction dataset with 20,563 annotated X-ray images and 1.3M instruction-following instances across tasks like attribute extraction, report generation, VQA, and dialogue. 2) Create MMOral-Bench: an evaluation suite covering five diagnostic dimensions. 3) Benchmark 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench. 4) Develop OralGPT by supervised fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MMOral instructions (one epoch).

Result: GPT-4o achieves the best accuracy at 41.45% on MMOral-Bench, revealing substantial room for improvement in dental radiology. After one epoch of SFT, OralGPT shows a substantial performance boost (e.g., +24.73% relative improvement). The authors provide dataset, model, benchmark, and evaluation suite for community use.

Conclusion: MMOral and OralGPT establish a foundational pipeline and resources to advance intelligent dentistry, enabling more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

### [43] [DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263)
*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DATE introduces Timestamp Injection and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling to enhance temporal reasoning and event localization in long videos for multimodal LLMs, reframing sampling as vision-language retrieval and achieving state-of-the-art results on hour-long benchmarks with 7B/72B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is hampered by uniform frame sampling and implicit positional encodings, causing information loss and weak long-range temporal dependencies. An explicit, continuous temporal reference and semantically guided sampling are needed.

Method: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) with Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS). Interleaves video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to form a continuous temporal reference. Reformulates video sampling as a vision–language retrieval task and employs a two-stage algorithm: (1) enriches each query into a descriptive caption to improve alignment with vision features; (2) samples key events using a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in absolute time understanding and key-event localization, attaining state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks; a 7B model even surpasses many 72B models on some benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit time encoding and semantically guided sampling can significantly boost long-video temporal reasoning in MLLMs, enabling strong performance with smaller models and highlighting the benefit of reframing sampling as a vision–language retrieval problem.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

### [44] [Unified Start, Personalized End: Progressive Pruning for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09267)
*Linhao Li,Yiwen Ye,Ziyang Chen,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSP-Seg introduces a progressive pruning framework for dynamic, resource-efficient 3D segmentation. It starts from a redundant model and iteratively prunes modules using block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss, yielding a lightweight PSP-Seg-S that matches nnU-Net performance while significantly reducing memory, training time, and parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical image segmentation is resource-intensive, hindering scalability and clinical deployment. Existing efficient models are static and hard to adapt across tasks, forcing a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: Progressive pruning framework PSP-Seg: begin with a redundant model, prune modules iteratively via block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss; produce lighter variant PSP-Seg-S; evaluate on five public datasets against seven SOTA models and six efficient models.

Result: PSP-Seg-S (lightweight) attains performance on par with nnU-Net and reduces GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter count by 83-87% across all datasets.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg offers a dynamic, cost-effective and high-performing alternative for 3D segmentation in clinical settings, enabling adaptable efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

### [45] [Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286)
*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision-Language Model learns to adapt its reasoning for chart questions by choosing between a verifiable Code-as-Thought (CaT) symbolic pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway, trained via reinforcement learning with dual rewards, yielding robust chart understanding without being stuck to a single reasoning mode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of relying on external tools or fine-tuned single-strategy models and to ground reasoning in verifiable facts, reducing numerical hallucinations in chart understanding.

Method: Introduce CaT to encode chart information symbolically; define Visual Programmability as a learnable property to decide when code vs visual reasoning is better; an adaptive framework where a VLM selects CaT or direct visual reasoning; train the selection policy with reinforcement learning using a dual-reward: data-accuracy reward and decision reward.

Result: Empirical results show strong, robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that VLMs can learn not only how to reason but when to reason, enabling dynamic, task-dependent reasoning pathways and improving factual grounding and robustness.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modality-agnostic U-Net extension enables segmentation across seen and unseen MRI modalities by adding a modality-agnostic input pathway and training with synthetic MRI augmentations; demonstrated on 8 datasets with 5 pathologies and 8 modalities, preserving performance on known modalities and improving on unseen ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation models struggle with fixed modalities; there is a need to handle unseen modalities and heterogeneous modality combinations in clinical practice; current solutions trade off modality-specific information for generalization.

Method: Modify U-Net with a modality-agnostic input branch alongside modality-specific channels; train with synthetic modality augmentations that alter appearance of pathology vs healthy tissue to create plausible new contrasts while preserving anatomy; evaluate on diverse datasets and pathologies.

Result: Maintains performance on modalities seen during training while enabling effective processing of unseen modalities, with improved segmentation in some unseen modalities; validated across 8 databases, 5 pathologies, 8 modalities.

Conclusion: This simple architectural change plus targeted augmentations provides practical multimodal MRI segmentation that generalizes to new modalities without sacrificing performance on known ones; code available.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

### [47] [Learning Object-Centric Representations in SAR Images with Multi-Level Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09298)
*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR is an object-centric learning framework for SAR imagery that disentangles target from clutter using multi-level features from SAR-ATR-X and wavelet scattering, integrated by a multi-level slot attention module to yield robust, disentangled target representations without mask annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images contain clutter that can resemble targets, causing entangled or spurious features that degrade target representations; there is a need for a method that disentangles targets from background without requiring mask annotations.

Method: Extract high-level semantic features from SAR-ATR-X and low-level scattering features from a wavelet scattering network to obtain complementary multi-level representations; fuse them with a multi-level slot attention module to produce distinct slot-based target representations without masks.

Result: SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery, preserving structural details and improving target representation clarity compared with existing object-centric learning methods.

Conclusion: SlotSAR demonstrates that combining multi-level features with slot attention enables effective object-centric learning in SAR, mitigating clutter-related entanglements and enhancing target characterization.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

TL;DR: MatCha is the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, featuring 1,500 expert-level questions across 21 tasks and four stages of materials research. State-of-the-art multimodal LLMs lag behind human experts, especially on high-level and complex visual tasks; simple prompting offers little improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between generative/predictive MLLMs and real-world materials characterization by providing a challenging, domain-specific benchmark that tests advanced visual perception and reasoning on characterization images; aim to catalyze progress toward autonomous scientific agents and faster material discovery.

Method: Construct MatCha with 1,500 questions spanning 21 tasks across four stages of materials research, designed to reflect authentic challenges in materials science. Evaluate current state-of-the-art MLLMs on the benchmark to assess their ability to interpret real-world characterization imaging data and reasoning at expert level.

Result: There is a substantial performance gap between MLLMs and human experts. Models degrade on questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception, and simple few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting does not significantly alleviate these limitations.

Conclusion: MatCha provides a rigorous testbed that can drive future research in materials characterization, enabling improvements toward new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents; the benchmark is publicly available at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: Heterogeneity among collaborating vehicles causes domain gaps; current adapters or full-network fine-tuning require joint training for each collaborator, which is impractical in real-world settings.

Method: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP) formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. It self-trains an adapter during inference to dynamically align features, requiring no labeled data and no joint training.

Result: PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios on the OPV2V dataset, approaching state-of-the-art methods trained on the full dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Inference-time, self-training adapters effectively bridge cross-vehicle domain gaps without labels or joint training, enabling scalable heterogeneous collaborative perception in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

*Illia Volkov,Nikita Kisel,Klara Janouskova,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of language-guided vs vision-only image classification with dual-encoder VLMs on ImageNet-1k, revealing complementary strengths and a simple, learning-free per-class precision fusion to boost accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore purely visual inference capabilities of vision-language models, quantify how language prompts and visual similarity contribute to zero-shot classification, and leverage their complementarity.

Method: Evaluate multiple dual-encoder VLMs (including SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5) on ImageNet-1k validation and a label-corrected variant; analyze factors affecting accuracy (prompt design, class diversity, k-NN neighbors, reference set size); propose a learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision; release code at the cited repo.

Result: Found that language and vision offer complementary strengths: some classes are better served by textual prompts, others by visual similarity; a simple per-class precision fusion improves overall classification performance.

Conclusion: Complementarity between language-guided and vision-only signals can be effectively exploited with a lightweight, learning-free fusion method, providing practical guidance for VLM-based image recognition and helping boost zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents BUG: a learning-enabled workflow that uses large multimodal models to turn chat-driven and image-based prompts into fine-grained clothing designs, coupled with a FashionEdit dataset to evaluate generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI in fashion design struggles with text ambiguity and requires domain expertise; there is a need for end-user-friendly, fine-grained customization and integrated design/editing workflows in industry-scale fashion production.

Method: Introduce Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with large multimodal models (LMMs) that converts chat interactions and image-to-prompt processing into automatic, fine-grained cloth design generation; develop FashionEdit, a dataset simulating real-world clothing design workflows; evaluate on metrics: generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality.

Result: Framework claims effectiveness demonstrated through evaluation on FashionEdit across generation similarity, user satisfaction, and design quality; code and FashionEdit dataset are released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: BUG with LMMs enables broader creative potential, lowers barriers for clothing design/editing without additional human involvement, and provides a dataset and baseline for industry-relevant fashion design workflows.

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy
designs easily, but the fine-grained customization still suffers from text
uncertainty without professional background knowledge from end-users. Thus, we
propose the Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with LMM to
automatically create and fine-grain customize the cloth designs from chat with
image-into-prompt. Our framework unleashes users' creative potential beyond
words and also lowers the barriers of clothing design/editing without further
human involvement. To prove the effectiveness of our model, we propose a new
FashionEdit dataset that simulates the real-world clothing design workflow,
evaluated from generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pre-training for few-shot automated surgical skill assessment improves transferability; small, domain-relevant data outperform large, less aligned sources; significant gains when including procedure-specific data; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSA suffers from scarce skill annotations; FSL is promising but relies on effective pre-training; pre-training in SSA is underexplored.

Method: Formulate SSA as a few-shot task; annotate OSATS scores on a robotic surgery dataset; evaluate multiple pre-training sources across 1/2/5-shot; measure domain similarity; analyze domain gap; compare with and without procedure-specific data; report accuracy and F1-score.

Result: Small but domain-relevant pre-training yields better transfer; 60.16% (1-shot), 66.03% (2-shot), 73.65% (5-shot); incorporating procedure-specific data increases accuracy by ~1.22% and F1-score by ~2.28% on average; large-scale, less similar sources can degrade performance; code provided.

Conclusion: Pre-training strategy for SSA should prioritize domain-relevant data and include procedure-specific data to maximize few-shot performance; future work should refine domain alignment and pre-training sources.

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

*Xiaodong Wang,Zijun He,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-image intrinsic decomposition method that uses a texture-guided regularization term to better separate reflectance and shading in complex scenes, arguing texture-aware priors yield superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intrinsic image decomposition is challenging in real-world scenes with spatially-varying lighting and rich textures. Learning-based methods often produce texture-less, over-smoothed results that hinder accurate recovery of lighting and texture information.

Method: Introduces a texture-guided regularization term within an optimization framework to decompose an image into reflectance (material texture) and shading, aiming to preserve textures while separating lighting effects in severe lighting and texture-rich scenes.

Result: Qualitative results indicate superior intrinsic images and higher quality decompositions on real-world images compared with existing approaches, according to the abstract.

Conclusion: A texture-aware prior embedded in an optimization-based intrinsic decomposition framework enables higher-quality intrinsic images for real-world, texture-rich scenes under challenging lighting.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

*Xiaodong Wang,Ping Wang,Zhangyuan Li,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified PnP and DDIM framework for ill-posed inverse problems, decoupling diffusion into denoising, data consistency, and sampling; introduces a hybrid PnP fidelity module applied to the denoised estimate to boost measurement consistency without disrupting sampling; shows improved reconstruction in single-pixel imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge Plug-and-Play priors with diffusion-based models (DDIM) to better solve ill-posed inverse problems, leveraging complementary strengths of learned priors and physical forward models, with a focus on single-pixel imaging.

Method: Decouple the diffusion process into three stages—denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling—and introduce a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, guiding data consistency while preserving the diffusion sampling trajectory.

Result: Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks show improved reconstruction quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for integrating learned priors with forward models by separating diffusion into interpretable stages and employing a hybrid PnP fidelity term, yielding superior reconstruction in ill-posed inverse problems without destabilizing diffusion sampling.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

### [55] [A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09368)
*Pengxu Wen,Tingting Yu,Ziwei Nie,Cheng Jiang,Zhenyu Yin,Mingyang He,Bo Liao,Xiaoping Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automatic two-stage framework for non-invasive ICP grading using fundus ultrasound ONSD measurement plus clinical data, combining stage1 keyframe-based segmentation and ONSD measurement with stage2 fusion to predict ICP grades; demonstrates higher accuracy than threshold-based methods on cross-validated and independent test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability and subjectivity in manual ONSD/ICP assessment and replace invasive lumbar puncture with a reliable non-invasive method.

Method: Stage 1 processes fundus ultrasound videos: frame-level segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus, and precise ONSD measurement. Stage 2 fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to predict ICP grades. The approach emphasizes interpretable ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration.

Result: Validation accuracy 0.845 ± 0.071 (five-fold CV); independent test accuracy 0.786; outperforming threshold-based method (validation 0.637 ± 0.111; test 0.429).

Conclusion: The framework reduces operator variability and integrates multi-source information to provide a reliable non-invasive ICP evaluation, with potential to improve management in acute neurological conditions.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

### [56] [Unsupervised Integrated-Circuit Defect Segmentation via Image-Intrinsic Normality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09375)
*Botong Zhao,Qijun Shi,Shujing Lyu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised IC defect segmentation method that uses an intra-image normal-feature extractor to reconstruct normal content, with a coherence loss ensuring residual normal regions, yielding defect maps from reconstruction residuals without external normal data; stabilized by pseudo-anomaly augmentation; shows robustness across three process-stage datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IC defects are diverse and subtle, and relying on external normal references is brittle due to layout variability and alignment difficulties. There is rich, repeatable normal structure within each image that can be exploited.

Method: A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates representative normal features from the test image; a coherence loss ties these features to normal regions; a decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual highlights defects; pseudo-anomaly augmentation stabilizes training.

Result: Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

Conclusion: An effective unsupervised defect-segmentation framework that eliminates external normal support by reconstructing normals and using residuals to segment defects, with added stability from pseudo-anomaly augmentation.

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRiFt decouples task-relevant clinical signals from task-agnostic noise in medical vision-language models using LoRA and learnable prompts, boosting in-distribution accuracy and robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs struggle under distribution shifts due to protocol and report variability, leading to unreliable, task-agnostic correlations. Safer deployment requires models that generalize well and behave predictably across unseen data.

Method: DRiFt is a structured feature decoupling framework that separates clinically relevant signals from noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens. It also curates high-quality image-text pairs by generating captions for a diverse medical dataset to improve cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty.

Result: In-distribution Top-1 accuracy improves by 11.4 percentage points and Macro-F1 by 3.3 points over prior prompt-based methods; robust performance across unseen datasets. Ablation shows disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment enhances generalization and reduces unpredictable behavior under domain shift.

Conclusion: DRiFt advances safe, trustworthy clinical VLMs by explicit signal-noise decoupling and improved cross-modal alignment, with code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

*Yuchan Jie,Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Fuqiang Zhou,Jianming Lv,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-Diff is a semantic-guided, clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method that treats fusion and SR as a conditional generation problem using a denoising process; it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on AVMS and multiple public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world multimodal fusion and SR, target/background structures are easily corrupted with low resolution and weak semantic information, leading to suboptimal fusion results; there is a need for semantic guidance and clarity-aware perception to preserve details across modalities.

Method: FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as conditional generation. It uses a clarity-sensing mechanism to provide semantic guidance for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. The fused result is initialized as Gaussian noise. A bidirectional feature Mamba extracts global features from multimodal inputs. With the source images and semantics as conditions, a modified U-Net performs a random iterative denoising process trained to denoise at multiple noise levels, yielding high-resolution fusion with cross-modal features and rich semantics. An AVMS benchmark with 600 image pairs is introduced, and evaluations on six public datasets plus AVMS show strong performance.

Result: FS-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art fusion+SR methods across multiple magnifications and datasets, delivering richer details and semantics in fused images.

Conclusion: Semantic guidance and cross-modal feature extraction via a denoising-based conditional generation framework effectively unify image fusion and super-resolution, offering strong performance and practical applicability, as evidenced by extensive experiments on AVMS and public datasets; code is available online.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

TL;DR: A lightweight 3D Attention U‑Net with residuals and transfer learning achieves competitive glioma segmentation on SSA MRI data, enabling practical deployment in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity and heterogeneity of annotated brain MRI data in Sub-Saharan Africa hinder the deployment of high-performance segmentation models in clinical workflows; there is a need for accurate, resource-efficient AI tailored to low-resource settings to support diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: A 3D Attention U-Net augmented with residual blocks, pretrained via transfer learning on BraTS 2021, trained/evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS‑Africa SSA dataset; compact ~90 MB model with sub-minute per-volume inference on consumer hardware.

Result: Dice scores on BraTS‑Africa: ET 0.76, NETC 0.80, SNFH 0.85; results suggest good generalizability and practical efficiency in SSA environments.

Conclusion: The proposed model delivers accurate glioma segmentation with a small footprint and fast inference, offering a viable solution for equitable AI deployment in SSA health systems and aiding clinical decision making.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

### [60] [Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429)
*Peisong Wen,Qianqian Xu,Siran Dai,Runmin Cong,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL to curb over-dispersion: distill patch correspondences with a noise-tolerant AP-inspired ranking loss and use an object-aware filter with learnable object prototypes via cross-attention, showing empirical gains across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion through implicit semantic concentration, but dense SSL suffers from spatial sensitivity and scene complexity; explicit semantic concentration is needed to improve dense patch representations for downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce two components: (1) patch correspondence distillation using a noise-tolerant ranking loss that extends Average Precision to continuous targets; (2) an object-aware filter that maps outputs to an object-based space via learnable object prototypes obtained through cross-attention.

Result: Empirical studies on multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL—via distilling patch correspondences and object-based representation—improves dense patch representations and downstream performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A politically-focused, large-scale dataset and a crowdsourced adversarial platform to improve detection of modern deepfakes, addressing limitations of existing datasets and improving robustness against sophisticated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection datasets are often outdated, lack realism, or rely on single-face imagery, limiting generalization to modern synthetic media and increasing misinformation risks in politics.

Method: Multimodal analysis of social media posts to identify propagation modalities; a human perception study showing increasing indistinguishability of synthetic images; creation of a large dataset (3M real images with captions and 963k synthetic images from proprietary and open-source models); development of a crowdsourced adversarial platform to continually generate challenging synthetic content.

Result: Demonstrates that proprietary generation approaches yield images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones; provides a substantial dataset for benchmarking detection; introduces a continuing, community-driven process to supply hard negatives to keep detectors robust.

Conclusion: A politically focused, large-scale benchmark and an ongoing adversarial platform can strengthen deepfake detection against evolving generative models and help safeguard political discourse.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing

### [62] [FlexiD-Fuse: Flexible number of inputs multi-modal medical image fusion based on diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09456)
*Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Yuchun Wang,Xiaoqi Cheng,Huafeng Li,Haishu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based fusion framework (FlexiD-Fuse) that supports flexible numbers of input modalities via maximum likelihood estimation with EM inside diffusion sampling, achieving state-of-the-art fusion performance on medical images and extending to other fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion methods are restricted to fixed input counts and struggle with clinical scenarios where the number of modalities varies; a flexible, end-to-end solution is needed.

Method: Proposes FlexiD-Fuse, transforms fusion into maximum likelihood estimation under diffusion; uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling; integrates Expectation-Maximization inside diffusion sampling; trained to fuse two or three modalities under same weights; evaluated on Harvard dataset with nine metrics; extended experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, multi-focus.

Result: Achieves best performance among latest two- and tri-modal fusion methods; demonstrates robustness to varying input numbers; extension experiments confirm effectiveness across multiple arbitrary-input fusion tasks.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse enables flexible, end-to-end fusion across varying modality counts, with potential for broader applications beyond medical imaging.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

*Dohun Lee,Hyeonho Jeong,Jiwook Kim,Duygu Ceylan,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Align4Gen to improve video diffusion models by aligning intermediate generator features with pre-trained vision encoders, introduces a metric to evaluate encoders for discriminability and temporal consistency, and demonstrates improvements in unconditional and class-conditional video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have advanced architecturally and in training objectives, but their feature representations lag behind. Aligning generator features with pre-trained vision encoders could bolster representational power. A systematic evaluation of encoders for discriminability and temporal consistency informs suitable alignment choices.

Method: Analyze multiple pre-trained vision encoders for discriminability and temporal consistency. Propose Align4Gen with multi-feature fusion and alignment integrated into video diffusion model training. Introduce a new metric to assess encoders. Demonstrate effectiveness on unconditional and class-conditional video generation; provide results on the project page.

Result: Showed improved video generation across metrics for both unconditional and class-conditional tasks. Full results available on the project page.

Conclusion: Align4Gen validates the benefit of feature alignment with pre-trained encoders for video diffusion training. Encoder choice and fusion/alignment strategy are important, with demonstrated improvements and a public project resource for reproducibility.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

*Akshit Achara,Esther Puyol Anton,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias exist in DL-based Alzheimer's disease classification from MRI; the work analyzes identifiability of protected attributes, data imbalance effects, and feature attributions, laying groundwork for fairer brain MRI DL tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness concerns in DL diagnosis from brain MRI by probing whether models rely on protected attributes (race, sex) and whether data imbalance induces shortcut learning, potentially harming underrepresented groups.

Method: 1) Train/detect if DL models can predict race or sex from 3D brain MRIs to assess distributional shifts. 2) Examine performance impact of race/sex-based training set imbalance to identify shortcut learning and bias. 3) Perform quantitative and qualitative feature attribution analysis across brain regions for both protected attributes and AD classification. Used multiple datasets and models (ResNet, SwinTransformer).

Result: Demonstrated existence of race- and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in DL-based AD classification across models and datasets.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for fairness-focused strategies in brain MRI DL, and the work provides a foundation for developing fairer diagnostic tools; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

### [65] [Improving Human Motion Plausibility with Body Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09496)
*Ha Linh Nguyen,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A momentum-based constraint links local joint motion with global movement to jointly model motion more physically and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local and global motion are coupled through environmental interactions; current models fail to capture this coupling efficiently.

Method: Introduce whole-body momentum as a constraint and a new loss term enforcing momentum consistency with ground-truth data.

Result: Reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves motion accuracy; code and data released.

Conclusion: Momentum-based constraint effectively couples local and global dynamics, offering a practical improvement for human motion modeling.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

### [66] [Region-Wise Correspondence Prediction between Manga Line Art Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09501)
*Yingxuan Li,Jiafeng Mao,Qianru Qiu,Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based method for predicting region-wise correspondences in raw manga line art without labels, using patch-level similarity learning, edge-aware clustering, and region matching, with an automatic annotation pipeline and benchmarking; achieves high patch-level accuracy and coherent region alignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Region-wise correspondence in manga line art is crucial for downstream tasks like colorization and in-between frame generation, but realistic scenarios lack segmentation/annotations. The work proposes a practical task and an automatic data pipeline to address it.

Method: Divide each line art image into patches and train a Transformer-based model to learn patch-level similarities within and across images. Apply edge-aware clustering to group patches into coherent regions, then use a region matching algorithm to align regions across images. Develop an automatic annotation pipeline (with manual refinement on a subset) to support training and evaluation, and benchmark on multiple datasets.

Result: The method achieves high patch-level accuracy (reported as 96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences across datasets, demonstrating potential for real-world manga applications.

Conclusion: The framework enables region-wise correspondence without pre-existing labels, offering a scalable solution for downstream manga processing tasks and providing a foundation for further improvements in robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

### [67] [Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610)
*Daria Laslo,Efthymios Georgiou,Marius George Linguraru,Andreas Rauschecker,Sabine Muller,Catherine R. Jutzeler,Sarah Bruningk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid mechanistic-learning framework combines an ODE-based tumor growth model with a guided DDIM to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs, integrating mechanistic priors with data-driven generation for DMG and glioma. It yields growth-aware image generation and tumor growth probability maps in data-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatio-temporal tumor progression is critical for neuro-oncology decisions. Conventional generative approaches often lack explicit mechanistic priors; pediatric DMG data are scarce; there is a need for plausible future imaging and directionality of growth.

Method: A mechanistic ODE tumor-growth model captures temporal dynamics including radiotherapy effects to estimate future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM for synthesizing follow-up MRIs that align with predicted growth and patient anatomy. Training on BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets; evaluation on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric DMG cases. The framework also yields tumor growth probability maps indicating extent and directionality of growth; performance assessed via spatial similarity metrics and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance.

Result: Generates realistic follow-up scans aligned with spatial similarity metrics; provides tumor growth probability maps capturing both clinically relevant extent and growth directionality as reflected by the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance.

Conclusion: Biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios is feasible by embedding mechanistic priors into generative models, enabling space-time predictions of tumor progression and growth patterns.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

### [68] [Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09527)
*Jian Zhu,Xin Zou,Xi Wang,Ning Zhang,Bian Wu,Yao Yang,Ying Zhou,Lingfang Zeng,Chang Tang,Cheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based multi-view fusion method (SGDF) with a contrastive extension (GDCN) that is robust to noisy and missing views, achieving state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view clustering quality degrades with low-quality data due to noisy or missing views. A robust fusion mechanism leveraging generative diffusion can better integrate heterogeneous views for clustering.

Method: SGDF uses multiple generative mechanisms to fuse multi-view features per sample, making it robust to low-quality views. Building on SGDF, the Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN) incorporates diffusion-based generation with contrastive learning to improve clustering performance in deep MVC.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on deep MVC tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SGDF and GDCN provide robust, high-performance deep MVC under noisy and missing-view conditions, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

*Paul F. R. Wilson,Matteo Ronchetti,Rüdiger Göbl,Viktoria Markova,Sebastian Rosenzweig,Raphael Prevost,Parvin Mousavi,Oliver Zettinig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualTrack uses decoupled local and global encoders to estimate 3D US trajectories from 2D sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with average error under 5 mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Three-dimensional ultrasound offers clinical advantages but is limited by cost and complexity. Robustly predicting 3D probe trajectory from 2D frames benefits from separating fine-grained local features (speckle) and high-level global anatomy cues; prior work tightly coupled these aspects, reducing robustness.

Method: Introduce DualTrack: a dual-encoder architecture with a local encoder using dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture fine-grained features, and a global encoder using an image backbone (e.g., 2D CNN or foundation model) with temporal attention to embed anatomy and long-range dependencies. A lightweight fusion module combines features to estimate the trajectory.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions, with an average reconstruction error below 5 mm, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling local and global feature extraction improves robustness and accuracy in sensorless 3D ultrasound trajectory estimation, suggesting a scalable approach to 3D US with reduced hardware complexity.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

TL;DR: InterAct introduces a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark, consolidating 21.81h of data, reducing artifacts via a unified optimization, expanding to 30.70h with motion variation using contact invariance, defines six tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art HOI generation while publicly releasing the dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human–object interaction modeling is hampered by limited, noisy, and poorly annotated datasets that show artifacts like contact penetration, floating hands, and incorrect motions. A standardized, high-quality dataset with actionable benchmarking is needed.

Method: Aggregate and standardize 21.81 hours of HOI data from diverse sources; enrich with detailed textual annotations; introduce a unified optimization framework to reduce artifacts and correct hand motions; extend via contact invariance to 30.70 hours; define six benchmarking tasks and present a unified HOI generative modeling perspective.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarking tasks; validates dataset utility as a foundational resource; dataset is publicly available and maintained.

Conclusion: The InterAct dataset and framework offer a scalable, public resource to advance 3D HOI generation and will be actively maintained to support ongoing research.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEFT-based change detection (PeftCD) using weight-sharing Siamese encoders from Vision Foundation Models with LoRA/Adapter modules; SAM2 and DINOv3 backbones; lightweight decoder; achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple remote sensing CD datasets with strong boundary precision and reduced pseudo-changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address pseudo-changes, scarcity of labeled samples, and cross-domain generalization challenges in multi-temporal, multi-source remote sensing imagery for change detection.

Method: A weight-sharing Siamese encoder built on a Vision Foundation Model, augmented with LoRA and Adapter modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning; supports two backbones (SAM2 and DINOv3); complemented by a lightweight decoder to emphasize backbone representations; trained by modifying only a small subset of parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets: SYSU-CD IoU 73.81%, WHUCD 92.05%, MSRSCD 64.07%, MLCD 76.89%, CDD 97.01%, S2Looking 52.25%, LEVIR-CD 85.62%; demonstrates precise boundary delineation and strong suppression of pseudo-changes.

Conclusion: PeftCD provides a balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, presenting a scalable paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change detection; code and pretrained models to be released.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

### [72] [Kling-Avatar: Grounding Multimodal Instructions for Cascaded Long-Duration Avatar Animation Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09595)
*Yikang Ding,Jiwen Liu,Wenyuan Zhang,Zekun Wang,Wentao Hu,Liyuan Cui,Mingming Lao,Yingchao Shao,Hui Liu,Xiaohan Li,Ming Chen,Xiaoqiang Liu,Yu-Shen Liu,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar proposes a cascaded, semantically grounded audio-driven avatar system that plans high-level instructions with an MLLM director to generate blueprint videos, then uses a parallel, two-stage, first-last-frame-based generation to produce long, high-fidelity videos (up to 1080p/48fps). It outperforms baselines in lip-sync, emotion, controllability, and identity preservation, and introduces a 375-sample benchmark for semantically grounded avatar synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven avatar methods treat instruction conditioning as low-level tracking and cues, neglecting the communicative intent and narrative coherence behind instructions, which hurts expressiveness and identity consistency.

Method: A two-stage cascaded framework: (1) an MLLM-based director that interprets multimodal instructions to produce a blueprint video encoding high-level semantics (motion, emotion, identity-directed cues); (2) generation of multiple sub-clips in parallel guided by blueprint keyframes using a first-last frame strategy, enabling a global-to-local synthesis that preserves details while honoring intent; a parallel architecture enables fast, stable long-duration video generation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows improved lip synchronization, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. Capable of 1080p at 48 fps for long-duration videos, and tested on a 375-sample benchmark, Kling-Avatar sets a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar advances audio-driven avatar synthesis by elevating instruction understanding to semantically grounded planning and producing long, high-quality videos efficiently, with strong expressiveness and controllability, and provides a new benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

### [73] [Measuring Epistemic Humility in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09658)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Sifeng Shang,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumbleBench introduces a hallucination benchmark for multimodal LLMs focusing on None-of-the-above rejection across object, relation, and attribute categories, built from a panoptic scene graph dataset; questions generated with GPT-4-Turbo and filtered; evaluates several MLLMs; code/dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks emphasize recognition accuracy but ignore the model's ability to reject invalid options, a key aspect of epistemic humility and safety in real-world use.

Method: From fine-grained panoptic scene graphs, extract ground-truth entities/relations. Use GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, with a None-of-the-above option. Apply manual filtering. Evaluate a range of MLLMs (general and reasoning-specialized) on the benchmark.

Result: Models show varying ability to reject incorrect options; the benchmark reveals gaps not captured by standard recognition tasks; provides new insights into model reliability and safety; code/dataset publicly released.

Conclusion: Explicit false-option rejection is essential for trustworthy MLLMs; HumbleBench addresses a critical gap in evaluation suites and enables more realistic safety assessment; data and code available publicly.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

### [74] [Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666)

TL;DR: A unified auto-encoder framework UAE for bidirectional image↔text multimodal learning, trained via reinforcement-learning-guided Unified-GRPO to align understanding (I2T) and generation (T2I) through a shared reconstruction objective; results show mutual gains and high-fidelity reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge image-to-text understanding and text-to-image generation under a single objective, enabling mutual improvements and a unified benchmark for multimodal unification.

Method: UAE framework; pre-train decoder on long-context captions to capture fine-grained semantics and spatial relations; apply Unified-GRPO RL in three stages: Cold-start with semantic reconstruction loss, Generation for Understanding (train encoder to produce captions maximizing decoder reconstruction), Understanding for Generation (refine decoder to reconstruct from captions).

Result: Encoder evolves to produce increasingly descriptive captions; decoder improves its ability to reconstruct from captions and follow long-context instructions; Unified-Bench benchmark to assess unification; reported mutual gains and high reconstruction fidelity (aha moment).

Conclusion: RL-guided bidirectional learning yields a robust unified multimodal paradigm, highlighting strong mutual dependencies between understanding and generation and establishing a path toward unified multimodal models with high fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

### [75] [Geometric Neural Distance Fields for Learning Human Motion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09667)
*Zhengdi Yu,Simone Foti,Linguang Zhang,Amy Zhao,Cem Keskin,Stefanos Zafeiriou,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRMF presents a higher-order neural Riemannian motion prior for 3D human motion, modeling pose, velocity, and acceleration via neural distance fields on the joint-rotation product space. It includes an adaptive-step projection and a geometric integrator for stable test-time rollouts, achieving robust, temporally-consistent, and physically plausible motion recovery with strong generalization across modalities and tasks on AMASS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D motion priors (e.g., VAE or diffusion-based) struggle to enforce temporal consistency and physical plausibility across diverse tasks and observation modalities. A principled, higher-order, geometry-aware prior can enforce realistic motion trajectories and improve robustness in reconstruction, denoising, in-betweening, and fitting from partial observations.

Method: Model the zero level set of neural distance fields (NDFs) defined on the product space of joint rotations, angular velocities, and angular accelerations to form a higher-order motion prior. Introduce an adaptive-step hybrid projector to enforce plausibility constraints and a geometric integrator to roll out trajectories during test-time optimization and generation.

Result: When trained on AMASS, NRMF generalizes across input modalities and tasks, achieving notable gains in denoising, motion in-betweening, and fitting to partial 2D/3D observations.

Conclusion: NRMF provides a rigorous, geometry-aware, higher-order motion prior that improves robustness, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility in 3D motion recovery and generation, with strong cross-modality generalization on AMASS.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

### [76] [Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672)
*Artem Lukoianov,Chenyang Yuan,Justin Solomon,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work argues locality in diffusion denoisers arises from data statistics rather than CNN inductive biases; an optimal linear denoiser can mimic deep model locality, and an analytically derived denoiser based on image pixel correlations better matches deep diffusion model scores than prior analytic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify why optimal denoisers and deep diffusion models diverge in behavior; test whether locality is due to architectural biases or data statistics; provide a principled, analytical denoiser aligned with deep models.

Method: Theoretically and empirically compare locality properties of an optimal parametric linear denoiser to those of a trained UNet denoiser; show locality stems from natural image pixel correlations; derive and validate an analytical denoiser that captures these statistics and aligns with deep diffusion scores better than prior models.

Result: Local locality arises as a statistical property of image datasets; an optimal linear denoiser exhibits locality similar to deep denoisers; the proposed analytical denoiser more closely matches the scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than previous expert-crafted alternatives.

Conclusion: Dataset-driven locality—not inductive biases of CNNs—drives diffusion denoising behavior. These insights enable analytical denoisers that better approximate deep model scores by leveraging natural image statistics.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

*Jiahao Wang,Yufeng Yuan,Rujie Zheng,Youtian Lin,Jian Gao,Lin-Zhuo Chen,Yajie Bao,Yi Zhang,Chang Zeng,Yanxi Zhou,Xiaoxiao Long,Hao Zhu,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Xun Cao,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialVID is a large-scale, richly annotated in-the-wild video dataset designed to advance video and 3D vision, featuring 21k hours of raw video, 2.7M clips (7,089 hours dynamic), and dense annotations (camera poses, depth, dynamic masks, captions, motion instructions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial intelligence models are bottlenecked by scarce, low-diversity training data with limited real-world fidelity, especially for dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. Existing datasets lack scale, diversity, and rich annotations to support robust generalization.

Method: Data collection and processing pipeline: gather vast raw videos; apply hierarchical filtering to create 2.7 million clips (7,089 hours of dynamic content); annotate clips with per-frame camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions.

Result: SpatialVID showcases rich, diverse data statistics and is poised to improve model generalization and performance in video and 3D vision tasks; it establishes itself as a key asset for the community.

Conclusion: By addressing data scarcity and providing dense, multimodal annotations on in-the-wild video, SpatialVID is expected to catalyze advances in spatial reconstruction and world exploration research.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video
and 3D vision research community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench to advance reasoning-focused open-source T2I; large-scale data with chain-of-thought and a multi-track benchmark; reports performance gaps among current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of large-scale reasoning-focused datasets and robust evaluation benchmarks in open-source T2I, to close the gap with closed-source systems.

Method: FLUX-Reason-6M: 6M high-quality FLUX-generated images, 20M bilingual descriptions; six axes (Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, Composition); explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought; 15k A100 GPU-days.

Result: Reveals critical performance gaps across models and identifies targeted improvement areas; provides dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code for community use.

Conclusion: Aims to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation by enabling richer data, better evaluation, and transparency in model capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

### [79] [An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834)
*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Bayes Theorem to interval-type-2 (IT2) inputs using a conservative update rule and provides a flexible algorithm to encode SME interval estimates into IT2 membership functions for Bayesian inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world Bayesian analysis, input probabilities are often uncertain and better represented as intervals provided by SMEs. The standard Bayes update requires precise values, which is unrealistic. Extending to IT2 fuzzy sets allows explicit handling of higher-order uncertainty and avoids inconsistencies in interval inputs.

Method: 1) Develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem with a conservative mechanism to prevent invalid outputs from potentially inconsistent IT2 membership functions. 2) Propose a novel, flexible algorithm to convert SME-provided probability intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions, enabling their use as input probabilities in Bayes Theorem. This algorithm generalizes previous work that encoded intervals into word MFs for Computing with Words.

Result: A theoretically consistent IT2 Bayes update framework and a practical encoding algorithm are established, enabling Bayesian inference with interval-based SME inputs through IT2 MFs and addressing potential input inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The work advances robust Bayesian inference under interval uncertainty by delivering an IT2 Bayes Theorem and an SME-interval encoding method, extending prior computing-with-words approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

### [80] [Automated Unity Game Template Generation from GDDs via NLP and Multi-Modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08847)
*Amna Hassan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A NLP/LLM-powered pipeline that converts Game Design Documents into Unity-ready prototypes, leveraging a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model and a Unity integration package to generate modular C# code that implements core gameplay systems, with strong evaluation against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between game design and implementation; automating template generation can speed up development, ensure design adherence, and reduce manual coding effort.

Method: End-to-end pipeline: parse GDDs to extract structured specifications; generate Unity-compatible C# code implementing core mechanics and architecture; fine-tune LLaMA-3 for Unity code; integrate with a custom Unity package to streamline deployment; evaluate against baseline LLMs on compilation, GDD adherence, best practices, and modularity.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved 4.8/5.0 average score across metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs; generated templates adhered closely to GDD specs across multiple genres; improved compilation success, adherence, best practices, and modularity.

Conclusion: LLMs, when fine-tuned for domain-specific code and paired with an integration package, can effectively translate design docs into functional game prototypes, reducing time-to-prototype and bridging the design-implementation gap.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

*Junyang Cai,Serdar Kadioglu,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework decomposes MiniZinc modeling by global constraint type, enabling modular generation and assembly of models with improved performance over simple prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating NL descriptions of optimization/satisfaction problems into correct MiniZinc models is hard and requires both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. A modular, agentic approach could reduce complexity and improve accuracy.

Method: Deploy multiple specialized LLM agents, each dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific global constraint class. A final assembler collects constraint snippets and composes a complete MiniZinc model. Evaluate against baselines using several LLMs with one-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Initial experiments show better performance than baselines like one-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, indicating the approach's promise.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates promise and provides a roadmap for future work, including potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Azalia Mirhosseini,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A confidence-aware loss, Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE), delays model collapse in recursive training by downweighting high-confidence self-generated predictions, extending the fidelity interval by >2.3x and generalizing across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI enables rapid synthetic data generation, training on mostly synthetic data risks model collapse where performance degrades across generations; existing mitigations are limited and overconfidence in self-generated data is identified as a key driver.

Method: Introduce Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE), a loss that downweights high-confidence predictions during training; provide a model-agnostic framework linking loss design to collapse mitigation; validate theoretically and empirically across modalities.

Result: TCE significantly delays collapse, extending the fidelity interval by more than 2.3×; framework applies across different modalities, with theoretical and empirical support demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Loss-function design is a simple, effective tool to preserve generative-model quality in synthetic-data regimes; TCE offers a practical mitigation that generalizes across modalities and can be incorporated into recursive training pipelines to sustain model fidelity.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

*Carina Newen,Daniel Bodemer,Sonja Glantz,Emmanuel Müller,Magdalena Wischnewski,Lenka Schnaubert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Examines uncertainty explanations and global XAI, evaluating an algorithm that targets uncertainty and robustness while comparing it to a visually intuitive but complex method to assess trust calibration, user satisfaction, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in Explainable AI by focusing on uncertainty explanations and global explanations, and by evaluating how different explanation styles affect user trust, satisfaction, and interpretability.

Method: Select an algorithm that covers uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI; evaluate its ability to calibrate trust. Compare with a second approach that emphasizes intuitive visual understanding but may be hard to comprehend. Use user studies to measure trust calibration, user satisfaction, and interpretability.

Result: The abstract indicates comparative evaluation: the uncertainty/robustness/global XAI algorithm can help calibrate trust to some extent; the visually oriented algorithm increases user satisfaction and perceived intuitiveness but may be harder to interpret due to complexity. Specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of incorporating uncertainty and global explanations into XAI guidelines and points to trade-offs between trust calibration and interpretability. It suggests that combining intuitive visuals with rigorous explanations could enhance user experience while maintaining interpretability, and calls for further empirical evaluation.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A prompt-based approach for cold-start recommendations using context-conditioned prompts and curated support sets improves ranking performance with LLMs, achieving higher precision@k and NDCG in low-data settings through exemplar injection and structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cold-start user problem in recommender systems by leveraging few-shot prompt engineering for LLM-based recommendations.

Method: Propose a context-conditioned prompt P(u, Ds) that maps a cold-start user profile u and a curated support set Ds to a predicted ranked list R_hat. The method uses exemplar injection, instruction structuring, token-level alignments, and embedding space regularization. Experiments with transformer LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4) evaluate performance.

Result: Optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring significantly improve precision@k and NDCG in low-data settings. The pipeline yields greater semantic fidelity, with prompt composition influencing attention and decoder behavior during inference.

Conclusion: Prompt-based adaptation is a viable approach to mitigating cold-start issues in LLM-based recommender pipelines.

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

*Crystal Qian,Kehang Zhu,John Horton,Benjamin S. Manning,Vivian Tsai,James Wexler,Nithum Thain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans, LLMs, and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation show similar overall surplus, but differ in negotiation strategies and alignment: Bayesian agents optimize aggressively and reject many offers; LLMs are conservative/concessionary with few rejections; humans are strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented. Parity in outcomes masks underlying process differences relevant for real-world coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate not only agent performance but also the negotiation processes across different agent types (Bayesian/statistical vs LLM-based) in dynamic, multi-agent settings, highlighting implications for alignment and deployment.

Method: A controlled, identical-condition negotiation experiment involving 216 humans, LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents; measures include surplus, rejection rates, and behavioral dynamics to compare outcomes and strategies across populations.

Result: Bayesian agents achieve the highest surplus through aggressive optimization but incur frequent trade rejections; humans and LLMs attain similar overall surplus but via different behavioral profiles—LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans engage in strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors.

Conclusion: Performance parity can obscure fundamental differences in processes and alignment, underscoring the need to assess behavioral dynamics and alignment beyond aggregate outcomes for real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AML actions are a priority for financial institutions, and ML has high potential to identify high-risk clients. This work aims to deliver a comprehensive, robust, and explainable ML pipeline suitable for deployment and regulatory scrutiny.

Method: A 16-step design and statistical analysis process; data curated in SQLite; SQL-based feature engineering; integration of a pre-trained model with the database for inference-ready deployment; explainable AI (XAI) modules to derive feature importance.

Result: The pipeline achieved a mean AUROC of 0.961 with a standard deviation of 0.005 on a dataset of 195,789 customer IDs, and finished in second place in the competition.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong performance, robust design, and practical deployment considerations (DB integration and XAI). It shows promise for real-world AML workflows, though external validation and more details on methodology would strengthen generalizability.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a

*Bui Duc Manh,Soumyaratna Debnath,Zetong Zhang,Shriram Damodaran,Arvind Kumar,Yueyi Zhang,Lu Mi,Erik Cambria,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuroscience-grounded framework for agentic spatial reasoning built around six modules, with framework-guided analysis of current methods, gap identification, benchmarks review, and a roadmap for virtual and embodied (robotics) environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human spatial intelligence and agentic AI, enabling flexible, context-aware decision-making in 3D unstructured environments by grounding spatial reasoning in neuroscience-inspired modules.

Method: Proposes mapping core biological functions to six computation modules (bio-inspired multimodal sensing; multisensory integration; egocentric-allocentric conversion; artificial cognitive map; spatial memory; spatial reasoning). Conducts framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluates relevance to modules, identifies critical gaps, reviews emerging benchmarks/datasets, discusses application domains (virtual and embodied/robotic), and outlines a research roadmap.

Result: A perspective/framework article that outlines a neuroscience-grounded landscape for agentic spatial reasoning, highlights gaps between current methods and biological principles, surveys benchmarks/datasets, and proposes a structured roadmap and research directions for generalizing spatial reasoning in dynamic/unstructured environments.

Conclusion: Proposes a structured, neuroscience-informed pathway to advance agentic spatial intelligence across virtual and physical domains, with potential impact on robotics and embodied systems; provides a project page reference (Github) for community engagement.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

### [88] [ProgD: Progressive Multi-scale Decoding with Dynamic Graphs for Joint Multi-agent Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09210)
*Xing Gao,Zherui Huang,Weiyao Lin,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProgD is a progressive, multi-scale decoding framework that uses dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model evolving interactions in multi-agent motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results on INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent prediction methods often treat interactions as static or overlook their evolution and the accompanying uncertainty. There's a need to explicitly model how social interactions evolve over time to improve future motion predictions.

Method: ProgD introduces a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture to capture spatio-temporal dependencies in future scenarios, and a multi-scale decoding procedure to progressively reduce uncertainty and improve joint prediction of multiple agents.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark and performing well on the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: Dynamic heterogeneous graphs with progressive, multi-scale decoding provide an effective way to model evolving social interactions and uncertainties in multi-agent motion prediction, enabling more accurate and coherent future trajectories.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory collaboration among LLM-powered autonomous agents, with modules for accountability, trust, and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address governance and accountability challenges in large-scale autonomous agent ecosystems as they become more capable and networked.

Method: Design a layered architecture (agent layer, blockchain data layer, regulatory application layer) and implement three modules: (i) agent behavior tracing/arbitration, (ii) dynamic reputation evaluation, (iii) malicious behavior forecasting; integrates blockchain for auditability and enforcement.

Result: Conceptual framework and design of a scalable, trustworthy regulatory platform; outlines module interactions and blockchain-enabled provenance and governance mechanisms; no empirical results, but a pathway for implementation and evaluation.

Conclusion: The work establishes foundational components for trustworthy, resilient regulation of multi-agent systems and sketches directions for future research and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

*Shuocheng Li,Yihao Liu,Silin Du,Wenxuan Zeng,Zhe Xu,Mengyu Zhou,Yeye He,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline extracts executable, multi-step data-analysis tasks from real notebooks, building NbQA as a large dataset, and introduces Jupiter (MCTS-based) to improve multi-step tool-use reasoning in LLMs; results show strong performance on NbQA tasks, approaching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs still struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use in data-analysis tasks. A scalable, authentic dataset and a reasoning framework are needed to train and evaluate better tool-use in real-world workflows.

Method: Develop a pipeline to extract tool-based data-analysis tasks and executable multi-step solutions from real Jupyter notebooks and data files to create NbQA. Propose Jupiter, a framework that treats data analysis as a search problem and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate diverse solution trajectories for value-model training; at inference, combine the value model with node visit counts to efficiently assemble executable multi-step plans with minimal search.

Result: NbQA enables Qwen2.5-7B (77.82% on InfiAgent-DABench) and 14B-Instruct (86.38%) to solve tasks, matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks; results indicate improved generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning across diverse multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: The pipeline and NbQA/Jupiter enable scalable, authentic evaluation and improvement of multi-step tool-use in LLMs for data analysis, advancing practical automation beyond current models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenIE provides the broadest triplet coverage while GraphRAG offers the strongest reasoning among spaCy, CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG for KG-based QA with LLMs, highlighting trade-offs between extraction coverage and reasoning capability in open-source approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation in understanding tall, thematically rich texts by constructing and integrating knowledge graph triplets with LLMs, and to comparatively evaluate open-source extraction methods and their impact on LLM-based question answering.

Method: A technical comparative study evaluating three open-source methodologies for constructing knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with LLMs for QA: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG. The study analyzes capabilities, state of development, and the effect on LLM QA performance, using experiments that compare triplet coverage, reasoning ability, and overall QA effectiveness.

Result: Experimental results show that Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE provides the most comprehensive coverage of knowledge graph triplets, while GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning abilities among the three methods. SpaCy is evaluated but not highlighted as the top performer in these metrics, indicating trade-offs between coverage and reasoning and suggesting differing suitability depending on QA objectives.

Conclusion: The study delineates the strengths and limitations of each method, discusses their current development status, and offers insights into future directions for improving KG-based QA with LLMs, including balancing triplet coverage with reasoning capacity and promoting open-source collaboration.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

*Bingning Huang,Tu Nguyen,Matthieu Zimmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Treats MCTS-derived trajectories as a new source of prefix-conditioned rewards to guide GRPO in a staged, tree-structured setting for policy optimization in preference-based RL; demonstrates stabilization but reveals saturation and reward-collapse challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage rich intermediate reasoning traces from MCTS to improve policy learning in preference-based RL without value networks, extending GRPO.

Method: Proposes a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a tree-structured advantage estimation and prefix-conditioned reward signals; accompanies theoretical and empirical analysis.

Result: Initial findings show structured advantage estimation can stabilize updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, but issues like advantage saturation and reward signal collapse persist; offers heuristic and statistical remedies and discusses open challenges for tree-like reward structures.

Conclusion: Staged, tree-structured MCTS-guided GRPO is a promising direction for preference-based RL, but practical challenges remain—necessitating further methods to control saturation and collapse and to generalize beyond staged setups.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

*Clément Contet,Umberto Grandi,Jérôme Mengin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces minimal supports as abductive explanations for why a candidate wins under common tournament rules; computes smallest such supports for several rules with polynomial-time algorithms; the problem is NP-complete for the weighted uncovered set; demonstrates explanations can be compact and certified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide certified, human-understandable explanations for why winners occur in tournament settings, addressing explainable AI needs.

Method: Define minimal supports (sub-tournaments in which the candidate is a necessary winner); analyze six tournament rules (top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin, weighted uncovered set); determine the size of the smallest minimal supports; develop polynomial-time algorithms to compute them for all rules except the weighted uncovered set.

Result: For each rule, the authors determine the minimal support sizes and provide algorithms (polynomial-time) to compute them; the weighted uncovered set yields an NP-complete problem; the framework enables compact, certified explanations of winners.

Conclusion: Minimal supports offer compact, certified explanations for winner status across multiple tournament rules and can be used to produce intuitive, viewable explanations of why a candidate wins.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

### [95] [Measuring Implicit Spatial Coordination in Teams: Effects on Collective Intelligence and Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09314)
*Thuy Ngoc Nguyen,Anita Williams Woolley,Cleotilde Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: In a restricted-communication online search-and-rescue task, spatial specialization improves performance; adaptive spatial proximity shows an inverted-U relation with moderate adaptation being optimal; temporal dynamics in movement patterns differentiate high- from low-performing teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinating movement in shared physical space without extensive explicit communication is common in emergency and security settings. While prior work covers co-located or knowledge-work coordination, less is known about dynamic, movement-based implicit coordination. This study investigates three spatial coordination dimensions—exploration diversity, movement specialization, and adaptive spatial proximity—and their relation to team performance, with implications for training and AI support.

Method: Participants: 136 individuals forming 34 four-person teams, assigned specialized roles. Task: collaborative online search-and-rescue with limited explicit communication. Measures: metrics capturing spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements within shared environments. Analysis examines how the three dimensions relate to performance over time, including temporal dynamics to distinguish high- vs low-performing teams.

Result: Spatial specialization positively predicts performance; adaptive spatial proximity shows a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship, indicating that moderate adjustment in spacing is most effective; temporal patterns in these metrics differentiate higher- and lower-performing teams across the task.

Conclusion: Balanced adaptive spatial strategies support better performance. The results highlight the utility of movement-based implicit coordination and offer guidance for training and AI-assisted team systems to monitor and support spatial coordination in role-based teams.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Provides 150 curated AutoML tasks and three subsets (Lite, Medium, Full) with Lite featuring 18 tasks for practical benchmarking.

Result: Introduces TAM Bench as a complete benchmark suite for end-to-end ML tasks, including the task collection pipeline, a difficulty calibration mechanism, and a comprehensive evaluation framework; provides three subsets (Lite, Medium, Full) and demonstrates practicality with a Lite 18-task version.

Conclusion: TAM Bench offers a realistic, diverse, and scalable evaluation framework for LLM-based agents in end-to-end ML workflows, with a readily usable Lite subset to facilitate rapid benchmarking and comparison.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

*Abdel Hakim Drid,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi,Abderrezzak Debilou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DRL architecture for resource-efficient semantic exploration that uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a selective external guidance source. The VLM is invoked as a dedicated action only when needed, guided by a curriculum learning strategy, leading to better object discovery and navigation toward semantically rich regions while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles with semantic exploration due to limited cognitive capabilities and small policies. Lacking external, commonsense knowledge, agents often rely on human-driven exploration. The paper aims to enable high-level reasoning and selective external guidance to improve autonomous exploration in unknown environments.

Method: Integrates a Vision-Language Model through a layered reward function and treats VLM queries as a separate action. The agent learns when to query the VLM to gain external guidance, thereby saving resources. A curriculum learning strategy guides learning from simple to more complex scenarios to improve stability and robustness.

Result: The approach yields significantly higher object discovery rates and an increased tendency to navigate toward semantically rich regions. The agent also learns when to prompt for external information, demonstrating a scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning in autonomous exploration.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical approach to integrating common-sense semantic reasoning into DRL for autonomous exploration, enabling more intelligent, self-guided navigation in robotics with resource-efficient use of external guidance.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

TL;DR: TORSO uses template-based prompting to coax LLMs to use internal reasoning without few-shot examples, enabling cross-task reasoning and strong benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome dependence on manually crafted few-shot prompts, reduce task-specific prompting cost, and promote consistency across tasks while leveraging the model's innate reasoning.

Method: Introduces Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), a template-driven prompting framework that elicits the model's internal reasoning to generate appropriate responses across diverse tasks without task-specific demonstrations.

Result: Shows strong performance on diverse LLM benchmarks with reasonably high-quality rationales, indicating effective elicitation of internal reasoning.

Conclusion: TORSO provides a general, cost-effective approach to leveraging LLMs’ internal reasoning across tasks without manual few-shot prompts, improving robustness and performance.

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

TL;DR: Hallucinations in legal LLMs persist despite RAG; authors advocate a holistic, consultative AI design with strong human oversight and verifiability to augment professional judgment rather than replace it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability and ethics of AI in law by diagnosing hallucinations, evaluating RAG mitigation, and proposing robust, regulation-aligned strategies.

Method: Analyze causes and manifestations of false information in legal LLMs; assess the effectiveness and limitations of RAG; discuss ethical/regulatory implications; propose holistic optimizations and a consultative AI paradigm.

Result: RAG mitigates some hallucinations but does not fully solve them; significant limitations remain, necessitating broader optimizations and a shift toward a consultative framework.

Conclusion: Advocate for a consultative AI paradigm that prioritizes veracity and traceability, using AI to amplify rather than replace professional judgment, with continued human oversight.

Abstract: This technical report analyzes the challenge of "hallucinations" (false
information) in LLMs applied to law. It examines their causes, manifestations,
and the effectiveness of the RAG mitigation strategy, highlighting its
limitations and proposing holistic optimizations. The paper explores the
ethical and regulatory implications, emphasizing human oversight as an
irreplaceable role. It concludes that the solution lies not in incrementally

### [100] [SEDM: Scalable Self-Evolving Distributed Memory for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09498)
*Haoran Xu,Jiacong Hu,Ke Zhang,Lei Yu,Yuxin Tang,Xinyuan Song,Yiqun Duan,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEDM is a verifiable, adaptive memory framework for long-term multi-agent systems that self-optimizes storage and enables cross-domain transfer, reducing memory overhead and improving reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term multi-agent systems generate vast trajectories and historical interactions, making memory management challenging. Existing approaches rely on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage but suffer noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory growth, and limited cross-domain generalization.

Method: Verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay; a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries by empirical utility; and cross-domain knowledge diffusion to abstract reusable insights for transfer across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: On benchmark datasets, SEDM improves reasoning accuracy and reduces token overhead compared with strong memory baselines. It also enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: SEDM is a scalable, sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration, with code to be released later in the project.

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

### [101] [Compositional Concept Generalization with Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09541)
*Hala Hawashin,Mina Abbaszadeh,Nicholas Joseph,Beth Pearson,Martha Lewis,Mehrnoosh sadrzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantum-inspired variational circuits learn compositional tensor-based semantics for image captioning with compositional generalization; proof-of-concept success using noisy multi-hot encodings, with mixed but outperforming CLIP-based encodings vs. classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is a core aspect of cognition that current AI tools struggle with. The authors explore whether the efficiency of quantum models can improve performance on compositional generalization tasks by representing compositional tensor-based semantics in Hilbert space and learning them with Variational Quantum Circuits.

Method: Interpret compositional tensor-based representations in Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these representations for an image-captioning task requiring compositional generalization. Two image encodings were used: (1) multi-hot encoding on binary image vectors, and (2) angle/amplitude encoding on CLIP-derived image vectors.

Result: Proof-of-concept results with noisy Multi-Hot Encoding (MHE) were good. CLIP-based vectors yielded mixed results but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Quantum approaches show promise for tackling compositional generalization and may offer training efficiency advantages; further work is needed to improve performance, especially for CLIP-based encodings and to generalize beyond the tested task.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

### [102] [Boosting Embodied AI Agents through Perception-Generation Disaggregation and Asynchronous Pipeline Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09560)
*Shulai Zhang,Ao Xu,Quan Chen,Han Zhao,Weihao Cui,Ningxin Zheng,Haibin Lin,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Auras disaggregates perception and generation to enable controlled pipeline parallelism, boosting throughput while maintaining accuracy, achieving 2.54x throughput with 102.7% of original accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI must operate at high thinking/inference frequencies in dynamic environments. Traditional sequential inference constrains responsiveness and throughput; parallelism risks data staleness that can harm accuracy.

Method: Algorithm–system co-design: separate perception and generation modules, introduce controlled pipeline parallelism, and establish a public context shared by both sides to mitigate data staleness and maintain accuracy.

Result: Throughput improves by 2.54x on average; accuracy remains at 102.7% of the original level, demonstrating the approach preserves accuracy while increasing throughput.

Conclusion: Disaggregating perception and generation with a shared context and controlled pipeline parallelism effectively overcomes sequential compute limits in embodied AI, delivering high throughput with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

### [103] [The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09677)
*Akshit Sinha,Arvindh Arun,Shashwat Goel,Steffen Staab,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scaling LLMs improves long-horizon task execution primarily through better execution capability, with even small single-step accuracies compounding into much longer task success; failures on longer tasks stem from execution errors and a self-conditioning effect, not just reasoning limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile why larger models sometimes fail on longer tasks and to evaluate whether scaling yields diminishing returns, by isolating the execution aspect of solving long-horizon problems and examining how task length interacts with model behavior.

Method: Benchmark and analyze models of varying sizes on long-horizon tasks, provide explicit knowledge and planning to isolate execution, measure per-step accuracy over increasing steps, investigate self-conditioning, and compare with “frontier thinking” models that claim to avoid self-conditioning.

Result: Larger models can execute significantly more turns than small models even when the latter have 100% single-turn accuracy; per-step accuracy degrades with more steps; self-conditioning (errors propagating through context) worsens performance and is not resolved merely by scaling; some modern models purportedly avoid self-conditioning and can sustain longer tasks in a single turn; frontier thinking models show longer single-turn task execution.

Conclusion: Focusing on execution capability—and leveraging model size and sequential test-time compute—offers substantial gains for long-horizon tasks and helps reconcile debates about solving complex reasoning problems versus failing on longer, simpler tasks.

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

### [104] [Uncertainty Estimation using Variance-Gated Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08846)
*H. Martin Gillis,Isaac Xu,Thomas Trappenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a variance-gated, ensemble-derived framework for per-sample uncertainty that challenges additive epistemic/aleatoric decomposition and explores potential collapse in ensemble diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for high-risk decisions relies on predictive uncertainty; additive splits may be inadequate; a more intuitive, data-driven measure is sought.

Method: Define a signal-to-noise ratio over class probabilities from different model predictions; introduce a variance-gated measure scaling predictions by an ensemble-derived confidence factor.

Result: Presents a conceptual framework and measurement approach; discusses conditions under which additive uncertainty decomposition may fail and indicates possible collapse in committee diversity.

Conclusion: Variance-gated, SNR-based uncertainty estimation offers an alternative to additive decomp and highlights risks associated with reduced ensemble diversity; further empirical validation needed.

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

### [105] [Instance-Optimal Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update and Its Quantum Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08911)
*Weiyuan Gong,Tongyang Li,Xinzhao Wang,Zhiyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An improved matrix LEA algorithm achieves instance-optimal regret by leveraging a generalized potential framework and a one-sided Jensen's trace inequality, attaining regret O(sqrt(T · S(X||d^{-1}I_d))) with the same computation as MMWU; plus a memory lower bound and quantum-learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass the standard minimax regret bound in matrix LEA by accounting for the comparator X through quantum relative entropy, enabling instance-optimal performance and expanding applicability to quantum learning tasks.

Method: Introduce a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA (MMWU as a special case); develop a one-sided Jensen's trace inequality via Laplace transform to handle general potentials; derive an optimal potential function from vector LEA using the imaginary error function; obtain an algorithm with the same computational complexity as MMWU.

Result: Proves an instance-optimal regret bound O(√(T · S(X||d^{-1}I_d))) for the matrix LEA setting; maintains MMWU-level computational efficiency; provides a memory lower bound; demonstrates superior performance in learning quantum states under noise and in predicting nonlinear quantum properties via linearized losses.

Conclusion: A versatile potential-based approach extends matrix LEA beyond exponential potentials; the relative-entropy-based regret bound adapts to the comparator, enabling faster instance-dependent performance and broad quantum-learning applications, while preserving computational practicality.

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

### [106] [Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933)
*Sreejeet Maity,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust Q-learning for adversarial rewards with finite-time guarantees in asynchronous RL; achieves near non-adversarial convergence with additive corruption term; includes lower bound and a no-knowledge-variance variant using refined Azuma-Hoeffding; first finite-time robustness results for asynchronous Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rewards can be corrupted by noise, sensor faults, or attacks, which can severely degrade Q-learning performance; there is a need for algorithms with provable robustness and finite-time guarantees in RL.

Method: Introduce a robust variant of Q-learning that tolerates a fraction of arbitrarily perturbed rewards under an asynchronous, time-correlated sampling model. Prove that the finite-time convergence rate matches the non-adversarial case up to an additive term proportional to the corruption fraction. Provide an information-theoretic lower bound showing this additive term is unavoidable. Also present a variant requiring no prior knowledge of reward statistics, analyzed via a refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales.

Result: Finite-time convergence rate matches the non-adversarial case up to an additive corruption term; an information-theoretic lower bound demonstrates the inevitability of this term; the paper also delivers a no-knowledge-variance variant with robust analysis, establishing the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning.

Conclusion: Proposes the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning under adversarial rewards, bridging a gap in robust RL and introducing probabilistic tools that may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework is proposed to handle within-group distributional uncertainty while preserving worst-group performance, solved via a gradient descent-ascent method with convergence guarantees and validated on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on accurately estimated per-group distributions, which fail in noisy, non-stationary, or evolving environments, and to prevent spurious correlations from harming underrepresented groups.

Method: Formulate a Wasserstein-based DRO problem that accounts for distributional uncertainty within each group, coupled with a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to solve it; provide convergence analysis.

Result: Demonstrates improved robustness of the worst-group performance under distributional shifts and shows effective performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach jointly addresses within-group distributional uncertainty and worst-group accuracy, offering theoretical convergence guarantees and practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle ECG diagnosis challenges including noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity, enabling accurate, scalable, and clinically useful automated ECG analysis.

Method: A dual-stage denoising pipeline using Morlet and Daubechies wavelets followed by a hybrid architecture integrating Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. The system performs two-stage classification: Normal vs Abnormal, then Abnormal into Arrhythmias, Conduction Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy.

Conclusion: FoundationalECGNet is proposed as a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable automated ECG analysis framework with potential clinical impact on diagnostic precision and patient outcomes; existence of code release is anticipated to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

### [109] [Value bounds and Convergence Analysis for Averages of LRP attributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08963)
*Alexander Binder,Nastaran Takmil-Homayouni,Urun Dogan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRP-type attribution methods can be analyzed as products of modified gradient matrices; the study derives singular value and component-wise bounds, yielding multiplicative constants that govern how empirical attribution means converge to their expectations, with LRP-beta’s constants being independent of weight norms—a property not shared by gradient-based methods or LRP-epsilon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the numerical stability and behavior of LRP-type attribution maps, especially under data augmentations and SmoothGrad-like procedures, and to contrast their theoretical properties with gradient-based methods and other LRP variants.

Method: Represent LRP as a product of modified gradient/Jacobian-like matrices; derive upper bounds for singular values; derive component-wise bounds for attribution values; extract multiplicative constants from these bounds; analyze implications for data augmentations and SmoothGrad-type attributions; compare LRP-beta to other variants regarding weight-norm sensitivity.

Result: Established upper bounds on singular values of the attribution-operator; derived component-wise bounds for attribution map values; introduced multiplicative constants that govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to their expectations; demonstrated that LRP-beta constants are independent of weight norms, unlike gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon; discussed implications for multiple non-geometric data augmentations and SmoothGrad-type methods.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical framework linking LRP-type attributions to gradient-based analyses, clarifies why LRP-beta can be more robust to weight-norm scaling, and outlines practical implications for attribution under data augmentation and smoothing techniques; invites empirical validation and extension to broader LRP families.

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a carbon-aware FL scheduler using slack time, alpha-fair carbon allocation, and a global fine-tuning phase to cut emissions while maintaining accuracy under carbon budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high carbon footprint of training large ML models. Federated Learning can exploit regional and temporal variations in carbon intensity (CI), but effective client selection and scheduling under carbon constraints are needed to realize emissions reduction without sacrificing performance.

Method: 1) Quantify emission savings from a slack-time scheduling policy that allows modest training-time extensions to align with lower-carbon periods. 2) Analyze trade-offs from statistical heterogeneity, participation bias, and temporal correlation in updates. 3) Propose a carbon-aware scheduler that combines slack time, alpha-fair carbon allocation, and a global fine-tuning phase.

Result: Experiments on real-world CI data show the scheduler outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across various carbon budgets, with pronounced gains under tight carbon constraints.

Conclusion: Carbon-aware scheduling that leverages slack time and fair carbon allocation, supplemented by a global fine-tuning phase, can reduce emissions in FL while preserving or improving model accuracy, especially when carbon budgets are tight.

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces PyePAL, an active Pareto front learning framework that combines Gaussian-process-based modeling, UMAP visualization, and fuzzy linguistic summaries to optimize spin-coating processing parameters for polymer thin films, yielding efficient multi-objective optimization with interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize spin-coated polymer thin films for multiple mechanical properties (e.g., hardness and elasticity) in an expensive, high-dimensional design space, while providing interpretable, expert-friendly explanations of the relationships between process parameters and performance.

Method: PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict hardness and elasticity from design variables (spin speed, dilution, polymer mixture) and guides adaptive sampling toward promising regions of the design space. It employs UMAP to visualize the high-dimensional Pareto front in 2D and uses fuzzy linguistic summaries to translate learned parameter-performance relationships into interpretable statements.

Result: Experimental results show the framework efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, with visual and linguistic explanations that facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge discovery.

Conclusion: The integrated framework improves efficiency and interpretability in multi-objective optimization of spin-coated polymers, enabling faster discovery of high-performance designs and clearer insights for practitioners.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANNA is a sub-quadratic attention mechanism that preserves MPC-like expressive power and enables shallow-depth reasoning tasks, with additional results showing constant-depth ANNA can simulate constant-depth low-rank transformers under an MPC framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers currently incur quadratic time in attention, limiting scalability. The goal is to design an attention mechanism with sub-quadratic complexity that can replicate the capabilities of MPC algorithms and support efficient reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduce Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA). The paper proves that ANNA-transformers preserve the expressive power established for standard attention in terms of capturing MPC-like capabilities, demonstrates near-optimal depth results for Match2 and k-hop tasks, and uses the MPC framework to show that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate constant-depth low-rank transformers, providing a unified view of efficient attention approximations.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: ANNA achieves sub-quadratic time complexity while retaining the expressive power needed to emulate MPC algorithms; it can solve key reasoning tasks such as Match2 and k-hop with near-optimal depth; under MPC, constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate constant-depth low-rank transformers, unifying a broad class of efficient attention methods.

Conclusion: ANNA provides a principled, efficient attention framework with strong theoretical guarantees, offering a unified perspective on efficient attention approximations and enabling scalable transformer models capable of MPC-like computation.

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

### [114] [Deep Context-Conditioned Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09030)
*Spencer King,Zhilu Zhang,Ruofan Yu,Baris Coskun,Wei Ding,Qian Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A context-conditional framework for unsupervised tabular anomaly detection that automatically discovers context features and uses a simple deep autoencoder to model conditional distributions, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global anomaly models assume a single distribution; in tabular data with heterogeneous contexts (e.g., users, groups), what is rare globally may be normal within a context. Conditioning on context is needed to accurately identify anomalies.

Method: Automatically identify context features in the data and train a conditional data-distribution model using a simple deep autoencoder; the model learns context-conditioned reconstructions to score anomalies.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple tabular benchmarks shows the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, highlighting the benefit of context-aware modeling.

Conclusion: Context-aware anomaly detection is beneficial for tabular data; a lightweight autoencoder conditioned on automatically discovered context features yields improved detection performance.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

*Dibyajyoti Chakraborty,Romit Maulik,Peter Harrington,Dallas Foster,Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture of Experts for weather modeling (MoWE) combines outputs of existing models with a Vision Transformer gate, achieving up to 10% RMSE improvement over the best AI weather model on 2-day forecasts, with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven weather models have plateaued; aim to improve accuracy by optimally combining high-quality forecasts rather than creating new forecasters; improve efficiency.

Method: Train a gating network (Vision Transformer) that dynamically weights multiple expert models at each grid point based on forecast lead time, producing a deterministic synthesized forecast.

Result: RMSE improvements up to 10% over the best AI model on 2-day horizon; outperforms individual experts and simple averaging; computationally efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: Shows a practical, resource-efficient path to advance data-driven weather prediction by leveraging existing forecasters through learned fusion.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

*Julian Oelhaf,Georg Kordowich,Mehran Pashaei,Christian Bergler,Andreas Maier,Johann Jäger,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scoping review of ML in power-system protection finds high performance on simulated data but limited real-world validation, with fragmented literature and inconsistent methodology. It proposes an ML-oriented protection taxonomy, standardized reporting, and guidelines to improve reproducibility and practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes protection needs, creating a demand for ML-based disturbance management, but evidence remains scattered and non-standardized.

Method: A PRISMA for Scoping Reviews-driven synthesis of over 100 publications on ML applications in protection and disturbance management, including taxonomy development, methodological critique, and recommendations for reporting and benchmarking.

Result: ML models frequently show high accuracy on simulated datasets; real-world validation is insufficient; literature is fragmented with inconsistent rigor, datasets, and metrics; a taxonomy and reporting guidelines are proposed to improve comparability and relevance.

Conclusion: Future work should prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic and robust validation, and evaluation of deployment feasibility to translate ML-based protection from theory to practice in dynamic, decentralized power systems.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

*Chaeyun Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE offers a scalable, subset-enumeration-free functional decomposition in RKHS for XAI, expanding beyond scalar attributions with local/global explanations and strong fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the exponential cost of considering feature subsets and the limited expressiveness of scalar attribution methods.

Method: Recursive kernel-centering to compute subset functional components f_S(x_S) in RKHS, avoiding explicit subset enumeration; orthogonal projection; model-agnostic; provides local/global explanations; theoretical guarantees (orthogonality, L2 convergence).

Result: On public tabular benchmarks: speedups from 0.6x to 9.7x (median ~3x) across 10 datasets; high fidelity with R^2 0.81–0.999; substantial rank agreement; enables 'component surgery' diagnostics.

Conclusion: STRIDE complements scalar attributions by providing a structured functional view, broadening XAI diagnostics and enabling scalable explanations without enumerating subsets.

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

*Gianlucca Zuin,Adriano Veloso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Rashomon Ensemble to exploit multiple near-equivalent models by clustering via performance and explanations to form diverse yet accurate ensembles, yielding notable AUROC gains under high Rashomon ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When many models perform similarly, standard ensembles may lack diversity; leveraging diverse high-performing models with explanatory differences can improve robustness to distribution shifts and real-world variability.

Method: Construct an ensemble by grouping candidate models based on both predictive performance and their explanations; identify distinct regions of the solution space (Rashomon set) and select a diverse subset that maintains accuracy; combine them into the ensemble.

Result: Demonstrates up to 0.20+ AUROC improvement on datasets with large Rashomon ratio; validated on open and proprietary collaborative datasets; shows real-world business benefits through robustness and practicality.

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble offers a practical strategy to harness multiple high-performing models, improving generalization, robustness to distribution shifts, and applicability in real-world settings.

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

### [119] [An entropy formula for the Deep Linear Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09088)
*Govind Menon,Tianmin Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a geometric-thermodynamic framework for Deep Linear Networks (DLNs), using group actions and Riemannian submersion to relate parameter space to observable space, defines Boltzmann entropy on a balanced manifold via foliation by group orbits, and delivers an explicit orthonormal tangent-basis via Jacobi matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled geometric description of learning dynamics and overparameterization in DLNs, linking parameter and observable spaces and enabling entropy-based thermodynamic interpretations of learning.

Method: Use group actions to study overparameterization and foliations; employ a Riemannian submersion from the balanced parameter manifold to the observable-space geometry; define and compute Boltzmann entropy on the balanced manifold; construct an explicit orthonormal basis for the tangent space using Jacobi matrices.

Result: Shows that Boltzmann entropy can be defined and computed on the balanced manifold; demonstrates that the Riemannian geometry of the observable space from prior work arises as a Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold; provides an explicit orthonormal tangent-space basis via Jacobi matrices.

Conclusion: Provides a geometric-thermodynamic framework for analyzing learning in DLNs, clarifying the role of overparameterization and the mapping to observables, and equipping the theory with concrete geometric tools (tangent-basis) for further study.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA dynamically allocates low-rank updates for LoRA in PEFT by using Hessian-based sensitivity (global and local) to determine per-matrix rank, improving efficiency, stability, and effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA’s uniform rank limitation prevents optimal distribution of capacity across weight matrices and existing rank-allocation methods are computationally heavy and unstable, hindering practical PEFT deployment in resource-limited environments.

Method: Compute second-order loss information (Hessian) to evaluate global and local weight sensitivities and allocate per-matrix ranks accordingly, achieving adaptive low-rank updates with minimal overhead.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Sensitivity-LoRA delivers robust performance, faster/fewer-parameter updates, and stable convergence across diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic, Hessian-informed rank allocation enables efficient, stable PEFT with LoRA, overcoming the uniform-rank bottleneck and expanding practical applicability in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causality-aware deep learning framework using MVGC and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection in Arctic SIE forecasting, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of correlation-based learning in distinguishing true causal relationships from spurious associations to enhance robustness, generalization, and explainability.

Method: Hybrid neural architecture that integrates Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection on 43 years of Arctic Sea Ice Extent data (daily and monthly). Identifies causal predictors, prioritizes direct causes, reduces feature space, and boosts computational efficiency.

Result: Incorporating causal inputs improves prediction accuracy and interpretability across lead times, with a scalable framework applicable to other dynamic, high-dimensional domains.

Conclusion: Causality-informed predictive modeling offers theoretical and practical benefits, enabling more robust and interpretable forecasting and feature selection in complex systems.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

*Xuefeng Wang,Lei Zhang,Henglin Pu,Ahmed H. Qureshi,Husheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous-time multi-agent RL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks to approximate Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman value functions, coupled with a Value Gradient Iteration module, enabling stable, scalable learning in high-frequency or irregular-time multi-agent dynamics and outperforming baselines on continuous-time benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL struggles with high-frequency/irregular dynamics; continuous-time RL (CTRL) offers a solution via HJB-based value functions, but faces curse of dimensionality and instability in multi-agent centralized value estimation. A scalable, multi-agent CTRL approach is needed.

Method: Employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions in a continuous-time multi-agent setting. Introduce Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) to align value learning with value-gradient learning along trajectories, improving gradient fidelity. Evaluate on continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, specifically multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics, demonstrating improved gradient fidelity and more accurate value estimates that support stronger policy learning.

Conclusion: CT-MARL with PINN-based HJB value approximation and VGI offers a scalable, powerful framework for multi-agent continuous-time RL, enabling effective control of high-frequency/irregular dynamics and advancing the application of HJB-based methods in multi-agent domains.

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses publicly available data to train ML models to predict ISP peering relationships, achieving high accuracy (notably 98% with XGBoost) and proposing automated peering partner selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISPs require global connectivity and often rely on peering at IXPs, which is complex and time-consuming. Automating partner selection can improve efficiency and optimize Internet interconnection.

Method: Collect data from public sources (e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA). Compare three ML families (tree-based, neural networks, transformer). Find that tree-based models perform best, with XGBoost trained on public data.

Result: Tree-based models, especially XGBoost, achieve high accuracy (around 98%) and demonstrate robustness to temporal, spatial, and data-missing variations.

Conclusion: Public-data-driven ML can automate peering partner selection, enabling more efficient ISP interconnection; practical deployment would need data quality checks and handling of evolving networks.

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

*Maria Risques,Kratika Bhagtani,Amit Kumar Singh Yadav,Edward J. Delp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HISPASpoof provides a first large-scale Spanish dataset for synthetic speech detection and attribution, showing English-trained detectors fail on Spanish and that training on HISPASpoof improves detection across six Spanish accents and six TTS systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Spanish in speech forensics and the rising risk of synthetic speech misuse; create a benchmark for detection and attribution in Spanish.

Method: Assemble real Spanish speech from public corpora across six accents; generate synthetic speech with six zero-shot TTS systems; evaluate five detectors; assess cross-language generalization and attribution ability.

Result: English-trained detectors do not generalize to Spanish; detectors trained on HISPASpoof significantly improve performance; the dataset supports synthetic speech attribution to generation method.

Conclusion: HISPASpoof fills a critical gap, enabling reliable and inclusive Spanish forensics, and serves as a benchmark for future research in detection and attribution.

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers for semantic communication, using GP-based Bayesian optimization to balance accuracy and compute, enabling runtime adaptation to channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference latency and transmission cost of large transformers in resource-constrained 6G edge networks while preserving semantic fidelity.

Method: Per-layer merging proportions optimized as a multi-objective problem; Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to build a Pareto frontier; runtime adaptation to channel quality.

Result: Significant FLOPs reductions with competitive accuracy across SNR conditions; adaptive policies improve latency-accuracy trade-offs under varying channel quality.

Conclusion: A scalable framework for transformer-based semantic communication in edge intelligence with training-free adaptivity and Pareto-optimal configurations.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks (QLSTM) with QA3C applied to USD/TWD trading show ~12% return over ~5 years with ~0.92% max drawdown, using a classical quantum-simulation baseline and a simplified strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether quantum-inspired neural networks combined with deep reinforcement learning can improve financial trading performance, particularly in FX markets.

Method: A trading agent combines QLSTM for short-term trend prediction with QA3C (quantum-enhanced A3C) for decision making. State design includes QLSTM features and market indicators; reward balances trend-following and risk control; training uses 80/20 split (2000-01-01 to 2025-04-30) with multi-core (8 QA3C workers).

Result: The long-only agent achieved 11.87% return over roughly five years with 0.92% max drawdown, outperforming several currency ETFs; results suggest that hybrid models can be competitively effective for FX trading.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired methods show promise for small-profit trades with tight risk in FX trading. Limitations include reliance on classical quantum simulation and a simplified strategy; future work could target more faithful quantum implementations and richer trading strategies.

Abstract: The convergence of quantum-inspired neural networks and deep reinforcement

### [127] [Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177)
*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO is a sequence-level RL method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping in the importance-sampling space to avoid bias toward short or long sequences; it introduces Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and a KL-corrected, sqrt(L)-scaled clipping band, with theoretical guarantees and empirical performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying fixed PPO/GRPO-style clipping to entire sequences creates length-based reweighting biases, distorting the objective. There is a need for length fair RL updates for LLMs.

Method: Define Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and show it yields a directional cosine guarantee between clipped and true updates for small LRE. Propose FSPO: clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a Gaussian-motivated band that includes a KL-corrected drift term and scales as sqrt(L).

Result: Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: FSPO provides a principled, length-aware sequence-level clipping mechanism with theoretical guarantees and practical gains for RL-based LLM optimization, using a Gaussian-inspired KL-drift clipping that scales with sequence length.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

### [128] [Breaking the Statistical Similarity Trap in Extreme Convection Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09195)
*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DART (Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks) tackles the mismatch between traditional weather-model metrics and real-world extreme-convection detection by transforming coarse forecasts into high-res brightness-temperature fields optimized for dangerous convection. It reveals a Statistical Similarity Trap and the IVT Paradox, and demonstrates improved operational metrics and real-world validation with rapid training and easy workflow integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation metrics currently reward blurry, statistically similar predictions while suppressing rare, high-impact events. This misalignment jeopardizes extreme-weather preparedness and operational trust. The work aims to design models and losses that enhance detection of extreme convection and downscale forecasts without sacrificing practical usability.

Method: A dual-decoder architecture (background/extreme decomposition) with physics-inspired oversampling and task-specific loss functions. Downscaling from coarse atmospheric forecasts to high-res satellite brightness temperatures, optimized for extreme convection detection, including a decomposition strategy and an oversampling approach to emphasize rare events.

Result: Key findings: (1) empirical validation of Statistical Similarity Trap across baselines; (2) IVT Paradox: removing Integrated Water Vapor Transport improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3) architectural necessity: DART achieves CSI=0.273 with bias=2.52 vs. baselines CSI=0 at equivalent CSI; (4) real-world validation: August 2023 Chittagong flooding case study. DART trains in under 10 minutes on standard hardware and integrates with existing meteorological workflows. Claim: first work to systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task with no prior benchmarks identified; demonstrates robust performance and calibration potential.

Conclusion: DART provides a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme-weather preparedness by aligning optimization targets with operationally relevant metrics, offering rapid training, and enabling precise calibration for high-impact events. The work emphasizes the need for specialized architectures and loss designs in hybrid tasks and suggests real-world applicability and future integration into meteorological workflows.

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

### [129] [Incentivizing Safer Actions in Policy Optimization for Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09208)
*Somnath Hazra,Pallab Dasgupta,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP3O introduces an adaptive incentive plus a progressively increasing penalty in Proximal Policy Optimization to stabilize constrained RL in continuous control, yielding improved training stability and performance with a theoretical bound on worst-case suboptimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained reinforcement learning in continuous control faces instability near constraint boundaries, making it hard to maximize reward without violating constraints. A mechanism is needed to keep policies safely within bounds while training.

Method: Propose Incrementally Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O) that combines an adaptive incentive mechanism with a gradually intensifying penalty on constraint violation, stabilizing training. Provides theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound on the worst-case optimality error.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark environments shows IP3O outperforms state-of-the-art Safe RL methods in terms of stability and constraint satisfaction, demonstrating the practicality of the approach.

Conclusion: IP3O offers a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees for constrained RL in continuous control, improving training stability near constraint boundaries and providing a bound on suboptimality.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

*Alka Gadakh,Vidya Kumbhar,Sonal Khosla,Kumar Karunendra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-phase study identifies growth indicators for agro-tourism using literature review and state-of-the-art ML techniques. It applies LASSO for feature selection combined with classifiers (LR, DT, RF, XGBoost) and reports that LR with LASSO achieves the highest accuracy (98% on 70-30 split; 99% on 80-20 split), followed by RF, DT, and XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agro-tourism is an important rural development strategy; there is a need to systematically identify key growth indicators and validate predictive models to guide policy and practice.

Method: Phase 1: literature review to identify important indicators (features) for agro-tourism growth. Phase 2: apply LASSO-based feature selection with machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) on train-test splits (70-30 and 80-20) to assess predictive accuracy.

Result: With LASSO feature selection, Logistic Regression achieves the highest accuracy: 98% on 70-30 data, followed by Random Forest at 95%. On 80-20 data, Logistic Regression again leads with 99%, while Decision Trees and XGBoost both achieve 97%.

Conclusion: LASSO-driven feature selection combined with Logistic Regression provides the best predictive performance among the tested models for identifying agro-tourism growth indicators; the study demonstrates the potential of ML-based feature selection to inform growth strategies, though detailed data characteristics and validation details are not provided.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

### [131] [Vejde: A Framework for Inductive Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on Factor Graph Color Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09219)
*Jakob Nyberg,Pontus Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde learns inductive policies for structured MDPs by converting relational states into bipartite graphs and applying GNNs with RL; it generalizes to unseen problem instances and performs competitively with instance-specific MLPs and Prost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable policy learning that generalizes across problem instances of varying size and structure by leveraging factored state/action representations and graph-based reasoning.

Method: Represent MDP states as facts, construct bipartite graphs, apply neural message passing to obtain latent states, use factored representations for actions, train with supervised and reinforcement learning, and evaluate generalization by splitting problem instances into train/test; compare against per-instance MLPs and Prost.

Result: Vejde policies generalize to unseen test instances with little score loss on average; inductive agents achieve scores close to instance-specific MLP agents, and outperform or match Prost in some cases.

Conclusion: Inductive policy learning via graph-based factored representations enables generalization to new problem instances and scalable reasoning in richly structured domains, making it a competitive alternative to online planning and instance-specific learning.

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

*Haipeng Liu,Ting Long,Jing Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSim distills domain knowledge and reasoning from LLMs into an QA simulator to improve prediction of student correctness, aiming to blend accuracy of LLMs with the efficiency of LLM-free models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, safe educational recommender systems by simulating student responses without real users; address the trade-off between fast, suboptimal LLM-free methods and costly, high-accuracy LLM-based methods.

Method: Distill domain knowledge and reasoning from an LLM into a QA simulator (LDSim) to enhance prediction of correctness from QA history, improving both simulation and knowledge tracing tasks; evaluates via extensive experiments.

Result: LDSim achieves strong results on both the QA simulation task and the knowledge tracing task, indicating the effectiveness of LLM-informed distillation.

Conclusion: LLM distillation is a viable way to leverage LLM capabilities for educational simulators, delivering improved performance with better efficiency; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDSim-05A9.

### [133] [Unsupervised Multi-Attention Meta Transformer for Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09251)
*Hanyang Wang,Yuxuan Yang,Hongjun Wang,Lihui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-attention meta-transformer framework (MMT-FD) for few-shot unsupervised fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, achieving high accuracy with minimal labeled data by combining a time-frequency encoder with meta-learning and contrastive updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and labeling cost in industrial fault diagnosis, with the need to generalize across different rotating machinery types when fault data are limited.

Method: A time-frequency domain encoder generates representations from randomly augmented data; a meta-learning generalization network performs classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning with a small labeled set, aided by a few contrastive learning iterations.

Result: On bearing fault and rotor datasets, the method achieves about 99% fault diagnosis accuracy using only 1% of labeled data, demonstrating strong generalization across equipment types.

Conclusion: The MMT-FD framework effectively learns fault representations from unlabeled data and generalizes across diverse rotating machinery, enabling efficient fault diagnosis with very limited labeled data.

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

### [134] [Harnessing Uncertainty: Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09265)
*Jiawei Wang,Jiacai Liu,Yuqian Fu,Yingru Li,Xintao Wang,Yuan Lin,Yu Yue,Lin Zhang,Yang Wang,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) re-scales policy updates by stepwise uncertainty and final outcomes to stabilize learning in long-horizon LLM-driven agents, yielding stronger performance than standard policy gradient baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assignment in long-horizon tasks with sparse, outcome-based rewards is challenging. In LLM-driven agents, the gradient magnitude couples with entropy, causing tiny updates for correct actions and volatile updates for uncertain ones, hindering learning progress.

Method: Introduce EMPG, a framework that modulates the learning signal using step-wise uncertainty and final task outcome. It amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps. Additionally, it adds a bonus term to encourage more predictable solution paths.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three challenging tasks (WebShop, ALFWorld, Deep Search) shows substantial performance gains and strong superiority over competitive policy-gradient baselines. A project page provides further details.

Conclusion: EMPG provides a stable, uncertainty-aware learning signal for long-horizon LLM agents, improving sample efficiency and final performance, with potential applicability to diverse long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

TL;DR: Presents DRSALife to learn Soft ALife rulesets for reaction-diffusion dynamics from data without prior physics; demonstrates PDE identification and good predictive accuracy with robustness to noise/sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge of system identification when underlying physics is unknown; need data-driven discovery for reaction-diffusion dynamics; extend Soft ALife learning to these systems; assess noise/spatial sparsity effects.

Method: Apply Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) to infer Soft ALife rulesets (Agent-based and Cellular Automata) from observed reaction-diffusion data; identify PDE structure and parameters; evaluate on data with varying noise and sparsity; measure predictive accuracy and robustness.

Result: Learned models predict emergent dynamics with ~74% accuracy; robust under Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity; PDE structure/parameters successfully identified; applicable to reaction-diffusion contexts.

Conclusion: DRSALife enables effective data-driven Soft ALife rule learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without prior physics, with strong predictive performance and robustness, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

*Junda Ye,Zhongbao Zhang,Li Sun,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) uses anonymous-walk–derived subgraphs and a routing mixture of experts to learn flexible, expressive subgraph representations, surpassing Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) and enabling interpretable, task-general graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks rely on local, pairwise message passing and often lack higher-order structural expressiveness. Random-walk kernels improve expressiveness but are typically designed for graph-level tasks and have fixed configurations, limiting applicability and flexibility. There is a need for a subgraph-centric, flexible, and interpretable framework that improves expressivity across diverse graph tasks.

Method: MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized subgraph experts based on structural semantics. This mixture-of-experts framework captures diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing expressivity beyond the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) test, and support with experiments and visualizations of learned subgraph experts.

Result: MoSE outperforms competitive baselines on diverse graph tasks and, through subgraph expert visualizations, offers interpretable insights into structural patterns learned. The method demonstrates enhanced expressivity and practical performance gains across tasks.

Conclusion: MoSE delivers a flexible, expressive subgraph-based representation learning framework that generalizes across graph tasks, provides interpretability through learned subgraph experts, and is theoretically more expressive than SWL.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

*Luca Giuliani,Michele Lombardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust, deterministic, kernel-based differentiable estimator for the HGR correlation using user-configurable polynomial kernels; demonstrates a subgradient suitable as a loss regularizer in constrained ML, with improved robustness over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGR generalizes Pearson correlation beyond linear dependencies but is effectively uncomputable in practice, causing bias-variance trade-offs in differentiable estimators. A robust, reliable estimator is needed for real-world applications (fairness, scientific analysis, causal discovery).

Method: Introduce a computational approach based on user-configurable polynomial kernels to approximate HGR, producing a differentiable estimator and a subgradient. The method aims for greater robustness and faster performance than previous estimators, including a fast but effective restriction.

Result: The approach offers robustness and determinism advantages; experimental analysis shows the computed subgradient can serve as a loss regularizer in constrained ML, validating practicality and applicability.

Conclusion: A kernel-based HGR estimator provides a more robust, deterministic option for real-world machine learning tasks, suitable for loss regularization in constrained settings, with potential for broader adoption and further refinement.

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

*Mohammed Tiouti,Mohamed Bal-Ghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaLLMiX introduces zero-shot hyperparameter optimization for deep learning by fusing meta-learning, SHAP-based explanations, and LLM-driven reasoning, achieving near-best performance with substantially lower computation and enabling local deployment without API calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in deep learning is expensive, time-consuming, and requires specialized expertise. Existing AutoML and LLM-based approaches either rely on numerous trials or lack interpretability and generalizability. The paper targets zero-shot HPO that leverages prior outcomes and explainability to guide model and hyperparameter selection.

Method: Leverage historical experiment outcomes augmented with SHAP explanations to guide the selection of hyperparameters and pretrained models in a zero-shot manner. Use large language model (LLM) reasoning to synthesize evidence and recommend configurations, and employ an LLM-as-judge to enforce output format, accuracy, and completeness. Deploy locally to avoid API costs and maximize speed. Evaluation on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs.

Result: MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance relative to traditional HPO methods while substantially reducing computational cost. Local deployment yields large speedups (response times reduced by 99.6–99.9%) and faster training (2.4–15.7x) on six datasets, with accuracy within 1–5% of best baselines and optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks.

Conclusion: Zero-shot HPO that integrates meta-learning, SHAP explainability, and LLM-driven reasoning can deliver near-parity with conventional HPO methods at a fraction of the cost, with robust results across medical imaging tasks and practical benefits from local deployment.

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8

### [139] [LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09396)
*Harry Mayne,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Yushi Yang,Andrew M. Bean,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate valid counterfactual explanations but struggle with minimality; there is a validity-minimality trade-off; SCEs may mislead; caution for high-stakes deployment; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether self-generated counterfactual explanations can meaningfully explain decisions of language models, by evaluating validity (change outcome) and minimality (smallest necessary edits) across datasets/models.

Method: Prompt LLMs to produce SCEs that would flip the prediction by modifying the input; measure validity by whether the modified input yields the intended alternative label; measure minimality by the magnitude of edits; test across several LLMs and datasets; compare generating general SCEs vs minimal SCEs.

Result: SCEs are typically valid but not minimal; when asked to minimize, edits are too small to flip the prediction, leading to a validity-minimality trade-off; this pattern is robust across models and datasets.

Conclusion: SCEs are an unreliable explainability tool at best and potentially misleading; deployment in high-stakes settings requires caution; further work needed to improve explanations or alternative methods.

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

### [140] [Kriging prior Regression: A Case for Kriging-Based Spatial Features with TabPFN in Soil Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09408)
*Jonas Schmidinger,Viacheslav Barkov,Sebastian Vogel,Martin Atzmueller,Gerard B M Heuvelink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid kriging-prior regression (KpR) adds spatial context to ML via spatial lag features from ordinary kriging and uses TabPFN; yields superior, well-calibrated predictions for soil properties across multiple field-scale datasets, especially with small samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geostatistics and ML offer complementary strengths; integrating spatial context into ML is needed for accurate digital soil mapping and reliable uncertainty, particularly when sensing features have weak predictive power or data are scarce.

Method: Compute spatial lag features using ordinary kriging to capture local spatial structure, feed them into TabPFN-based regression (KpR with TabPFN), compare against regression/residual kriging with TabPFN and non-spatial ML baselines across six LimeSoDa datasets (SOC, clay, pH) with remotely sensed and proximal sensing features.

Result: KpR with TabPFN provides reliable uncertainty estimates and improved accuracy relative to baselines; average R2 increases by ~30% over ML without spatial context; TabPFN's predictive strength plus spatial features drive gains; particularly beneficial for small sample sizes or weak feature relationships.

Conclusion: KpR with TabPFN is robust and versatile for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture.

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

*Daniel Agyapong,Briana H. Beatty,Peter G. Kennedy,Toby D. Hocking*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SAC cross-validation for evaluating co-occurrence network inference across spatial-temporal niches and proposes fuser, an environment-aware learning method that yields niche-specific predictive networks and improves cross-environment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current co-occurrence analyses often rely on single-environment snapshots, neglecting how microbial associations adapt across different environments and times. The study aims to evaluate algorithm performance across spatial-temporal contexts and develop methods that preserve niche-specific signals while leveraging cross-environment information.

Method: Proposes Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) to assess performance when training/testing within the same niche (Same) versus training/testing on combined data from multiple niches (All). Introduces fuser, a learning algorithm that retains subsample-specific signals while sharing relevant information across environments to infer environment-specific networks rather than a single generalized one.

Result: Fuser achieves predictive performance comparable to glmnet in homogeneous (Same) settings and shows a notable reduction in test error in cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of SAC and fuser provides a practical framework for dynamic, environment-aware microbiome network inference, enabling distinct, environment-specific networks with robust cross-environment performance.

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

*Anjie Qiao,Zhen Wang,Chuan Chen,DeFu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion (CSGD) for discrete graphs, enabling flexible multi-condition control in molecular graph generation via Composable Guidance (CoG) and Probability Calibration (PC); achieves state-of-the-art controllability on four datasets with high validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph diffusion methods struggle with multi-conditional constraints on discrete graphs due to joint conditioning or relaxations that hurt fidelity. A principled, flexible approach to condition-guided sampling is needed for reliable molecular design.

Method: Proposes CSGD, extending score matching to discrete graphs with concrete scores. Introduces Composable Guidance (CoG) for fine-grained, partial condition control during sampling and Probability Calibration (PC) to adjust transition probabilities to reduce train-test mismatch between learning and sampling.

Result: Four molecular datasets show state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.3% improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity.

Conclusion: Score-based modeling is advantageous for discrete graph generation, and the proposed CoG and PC techniques enable flexible, accurate, multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

### [143] [AquaCast: Urban Water Dynamics Forecasting with Precipitation-Informed Multi-Input Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09458)
*Golnoosh Abdollahinejad,Saleh Baghersalimi,Denisa-Andreea Constantinescu,Sergey Shevchik,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AquaCast is a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model for urban water dynamics forecasting that embeds exogenous inputs and forecasts only endogenous variables, achieving state-of-the-art results on LausanneCity and synthetic datasets, indicating strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to forecast urban water dynamics by capturing inter-variable and temporal dependencies using both endogenous measurements (e.g., water height, discharge) and exogenous factors (e.g., precipitation history/forecast). Traditional methods struggle to integrate these factors effectively and often require forecasting exogenous inputs themselves.

Method: A multi-input, multi-output neural architecture named AquaCast. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer so they are not forecasted; the model attends to short-term influences and learns inter-variable and temporal dependencies across all inputs, but forecasts only endogenous variables. Evaluated on LausanneCity data (four urban drainage sensors) and on three large-scale synthetic datasets (MeteoSwiss-derived, Lorenz Attractors, Random Fields) across 100 nodes.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance when using only endogenous variables. Including exogenous variables and forecast reports further improves accuracy. It generalizes well to real and synthetic datasets and scales to large networks.

Conclusion: Embedding exogenous inputs and using a unified multi-input, multi-output architecture enables robust, scalable forecasting of endogenous water dynamics with strong generalization across real and synthetic urban drainage scenarios.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Keeping pace with the rapid growth of academia literature presents a
significant challenge for researchers, funding bodies, and academic societies.
To address the time-consuming manual effort required for scholarly discovery,
we present a novel, fully automated system that transitions from data discovery
to direct action. Our pipeline demonstrates how a specialized AI agent,
'Agent-E', can be tasked with identifying papers from specific geographic
regions within conference proceedings and then executing a Robotic Process
Automation (RPA) to complete a predefined action, such as submitting a
nomination form. We validated our system on 586 papers from five different
conferences, where it successfully identified every target paper with a recall
of 100% and a near perfect accuracy of 99.4%. This demonstration highlights the
potential of task-oriented AI agents to not only filter information but also to
actively participate in and accelerate the workflows of the academic community.

introducing a fully explainable method based on temporal rules. Motivated by
recent work proposing a strong baseline using recurrent facts, our approach

*Zhanhong Jiang,Md Zahid Hasan,Nastaran Saadati,Aditya Balu,Chao Liu,Soumik Sarkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces D2P2-SGD, a dynamically private projected SGD that blends dynamic differential privacy with automatic gradient clipping and random projection; achieves sub-linear convergence and improved utility under privacy constraints, with empirical gains on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy leakage in stochastic optimization (parameters and gradients) and the limitations of DPSGD's static noise, especially for large-scale models where efficient learning is challenging.

Method: Combine dynamic differential privacy with automatic gradient clipping and integrate random projection with SGD, enabling a tunable tradeoff between utility and privacy; provide theoretical analysis showing sub-linear convergence and a discussion of the utility-privacy tradeoff (DDP improves utility at privacy cost; random projection boosts efficiency).

Result: The approach yields provably sub-linear convergence rates across objective functions and demonstrates empirical accuracy gains while preserving privacy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD offers a tunable, more efficient DP-SGD variant with better utility under privacy constraints and scalable learning for large models; code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIPES is a curated, diverse, and extensive collection of machine learning pipelines (9,408 pipelines across 300 datasets) designed to address ASP meta-learning, overcoming OpenML's pipeline diversity gaps and enabling richer analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational burden of Algorithm Selection by leveraging previously executed experiments while addressing OpenML's limitations in pipeline diversity and representation.

Method: Construct a comprehensive dataset (PIPES) comprising experiments that apply 9,408 pipelines across 300 datasets, covering all combinations of selected preprocessing and modeling techniques; record detailed pipeline blocks, training/testing times, predictions, performances, and error messages; provide data and code publicly for replication and extension.

Result: A new, expansive repository (PIPES) that enables analyses over diverse and representative pipelines and datasets; includes rich metadata and performance information, with potential for future expansion; hosted at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: PIPES offers a more complete and diverse resource for meta-learning in the ASP context, addressing the biases and limitations observed in OpenML and supporting broader research in algorithm selection.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Few-shot learning with Prototypical Networks on cough spectrograms can match traditional deep learning with much less data for COVID-19/flu/healthy classification. Multi-class performance (~74.9% with 15-shot per class) is comparable to binary (~70%+ across pairs); Flu is easiest to distinguish, Healthy hardest. Statistical tests show no significant difference between binary and multi-class models, supporting multi-class viability in data-scarce medical diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical audio classification often suffers from scarce labeled data. The study investigates whether few-shot learning can achieve competitive performance against traditional deep learning and whether multi-class models can match or exceed binary classifiers in this context.

Method: Prototypical Networks using spectrogram representations of cough sounds. Evaluation of both multi-class and binary setups with 15 support examples per class. Comparison of accuracies and class-wise performance, plus paired t-test and Wilcoxon tests to assess significance of binary vs multi-class differences.

Result: Achieves 74.87% accuracy in multi-class with 15-shot per class; binary classification yields >70% accuracy across all class pairs. Flu is the most distinguishable class; Healthy is the most challenging. Statistical tests: paired t-test p=0.149; Wilcoxon p=0.125, indicating no significant difference between binary and multiclass performance.

Conclusion: Few-shot learning is feasible for medical diagnostics with limited labeled data. Multi-class classification can perform comparably to binary classification in cough-based disease detection, enabling efficient deployment when labeled data are scarce.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,

TL;DR: ProDiGy is a Byzantine-robust federated learning algorithm that uses a joint dual scoring of client gradients (proximity and dissimilarity) to robustly aggregate updates under non-IID data, outperforming existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, especially with heterogeneous data; robust defenses are needed when IID is violated.

Method: A joint dual scoring system evaluating gradients by proximity and dissimilarity; integrates into aggregation to distinguish honest from malicious clients; tested via extensive numerical experiments.

Result: ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses across various scenarios, maintaining model accuracy under non-IID data when other defenses fail.

Conclusion: A dual-perspective approach promotes natural similarity among honest clients while flagging uniformity as a potential attack indicator, improving robustness to Byzantine attacks in heterogeneous data settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

### [150] [Graph Alignment via Dual-Pass Spectral Encoding and Latent Space Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09597)
*Maysam Behmanesh,Erkan Turan,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel dual-pass spectral encoding coupled with a geometry-aware functional map enables robust unsupervised graph alignment by improving node distinctiveness and cross-graph geometric consistency, with strong empirical gains and cross-domain generalization to vision-language representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised graph alignment struggles due to (1) oversmoothing in standard GNN embeddings that harms node distinctiveness, and (2) misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability. A method that preserves discriminative node features while aligning latent spaces could substantially improve alignment reliability.

Method: Introduce a dual-pass encoder that uses both low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to produce embeddings that are structure-aware and discriminative. Add a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective, isometric transformations between graph embeddings to enforce consistent geometric relationships across representations.

Result: Empirically, the method outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines on graph benchmarks, showing robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. It also generalizes to vision-language tasks, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations across diverse pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles both node distinctiveness and latent-space misalignment, delivering a unified approach with strong performance in graph alignment and notable cross-domain applicability to vision-language alignment.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Motivation: Provide fast, generalizable surrogates for chaotic and stochastic spatio-temporal PDEs across wide parameter ranges and domain sizes, enabling efficient exploration and statistical analysis (including rare events).

Method: Pre-train on a single parameter domain; fine-tune on a smaller, diverse dataset to promote generalization across parameter values; use local attention to adapt to different domain sizes/resolutions, enabling pre-training on small domains and learning expansion to larger domains; incorporate a probabilistic variant for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Demonstrates capability to capture dynamics at interpolated parameter values; achieves significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical integration; probabilistic variant provides uncertainty estimates enabling statistical study of rare events.

Conclusion: Combining parameter-conditioned pretraining with targeted fine-tuning and local attention yields scalable, efficient emulators for chaotic/stochastically-forced PDEs, enabling fast parameter sweeps and uncertainty-aware analyses.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Motivation: to efficiently learn operators for families of PDEs with multiple inputs, reducing generalization gap and ensuring discretization-invariant predictions, by combining reduced-basis ideas with physics-informed neural networks.

Method: offline greedy algorithm builds the network structure adaptively; knowledge distillation with task-specific activation functions yields a compact, physics-embedded model; evaluation against PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO, CNO.

Result: numerical experiments show ReBaNO greatly reduces the generalization gap for in- and out-of-distribution tests and uniquely achieves strict discretization invariance among operator learners.

Conclusion: ReBaNO provides a data-lean, efficient, physics-informed operator learning framework with superior generalization and discretization properties compared with existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis
Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct
inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

### [153] [Explaining Concept Drift through the Evolution of Group Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09616)
*Ignacy Stępka,Jerzy Stefanowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to explain concept drift by tracking temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs) via shifts in cluster centroids and action vectors, integrated in a three-layer framework to diagnose root causes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift degrades model performance and while drift detection is well-studied, explaining how and why a model's decision-making changes remains challenging; need interpretable diagnostics to identify root causes.

Method: Compute and monitor group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs) over time, analyze shifts in their cluster centroids and associated counterfactual action vectors before and after drift, and integrate this analysis in a three-layer framework (data layer: distributional shifts; model layer: prediction disagreement; explanation layer: evolving GCEs).

Result: Suggests that the evolving GCEs provide an interpretable proxy for structural changes in the decision boundary, enabling a holistic drift diagnosis and the ability to distinguish root causes such as spatial data shifts versus re-labeling of concepts.

Conclusion: A holistic, three-layer approach using temporal GCE evolution offers more comprehensive drift diagnosis and interpretable insights into how and why model reasoning changes under concept drift.

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

*Roshan Balaji,Joe Bobby,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Functional Group Representation (FGR) for molecular representations using curated FG and mined MFG; achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides interpretable structure-property links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for molecular property prediction often lack interpretability; there is a need for representations tied to fundamental chemical substructures that chemists can reason with.

Method: Develop the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework that encodes molecules based on two types of functional groups: curated FG from established chemical knowledge and mined MFG discovered via sequential pattern mining on a large molecular corpus. The framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space, using pre-training on a large unlabeled molecule dataset, and optionally incorporates 2D structure-based descriptors.

Result: FGR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics, while enabling intrinsic chemical interpretability; representations align with established chemical principles, allowing linkages between predicted properties and specific functional groups.

Conclusion: The work represents a significant step toward high-performing, chemically interpretable deep learning models for molecular discovery.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FG-FARL is an offline RL method that jointly optimizes per-group safety thresholds to equalize a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm) across protected subgroups, while maintaining competitive value relative to baselines, demonstrated on Medicaid trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Promotes safe and fair decision support in healthcare by balancing harm and subgroup fairness in offline RL; addresses need for per-group safety calibration to avoid disproportionate harms.

Method: Offline RL procedure; calibrates per-group safety thresholds (feasibility-guided) to enforce fairness target across subgroups; evaluated on de-identified longitudinal Medicaid data; compared to BC and HACO; reports off-policy value estimates with bootstrap 95% CIs and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values.

Result: FG-FARL achieves value comparable to BC and HACO while improving fairness metrics (reduced disparity across groups) according to subgroup analyses; shows practical feasibility.

Conclusion: Feasibility-guided per-group calibration in offline RL offers a viable path to safer, more equitable decision support in healthcare; FG-FARL demonstrates favorable trade-offs between safety fairness and performance.

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

### [156] [ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09679)
*Bingxin Xu,Zhen Dong,Oussama Elachqar,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant replaces fixed Hadamard rotations with learnable, orthogonal butterfly transforms to adapt to layer-specific activation outliers for 2-bit quantization, achieving efficient O(n log n) computation with few parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme quantization (2-bit) suffers from activation outliers and non-adaptive fixed transforms; different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, necessitating layer-adaptive rotations.

Method: Introduce continuous Givens-rotation-based butterfly transforms that are orthogonal by construction, enabling gradient-based learning of rotation angles. Maintain O(n log n) complexity and only n log n/2 learnable parameters. Apply a uniformity regularization on post-transform activations to yield smoother distributions for quantization. Calibration requires ~128 samples and converges quickly on a single GPU.

Result: Empirical gains on LLaMA-2-7B: 2-bit quantization yields perplexity of 15.4 with ButterflyQuant, versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Conclusion: Layer-adaptive, differentiable, orthogonal butterfly transforms effectively suppress activation outliers for low-bit quantization, delivering substantial performance improvements with modest calibration cost and maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

*Pengfei Wang,Yuexin Yang,Shuangmin Chen,Shiqing Xin,Changhe Tu,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Backward-time inversion with a multi-field tetrahedral framework for robust, detail-preserving swept-volume computation across translations and screw motions; enables practical path planning and collision detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current swept-volume methods either explicitly track surfaces (fragile under complex interactions) or rely on implicit representations (fidelity losses and optimization challenges). A method that preserves geometric detail while remaining robust is needed.

Method: Invert motion perspective by fixing the object and tracing spatial points backward in time, turning complex trajectories into linearizable point motions. Develop a multi-field tetrahedral framework that stores multiple distance fields per element to preserve fine geometric details at trajectory intersections where single-field methods fail.

Result: The approach robustly computes swept volumes for diverse motions (including translations and screw motions) and supports practical tasks in path planning and collision detection.

Conclusion: The proposed backward-time, multi-field tetrahedral strategy improves robustness and geometric fidelity in swept-volume computation and is well-suited for planning and collision-detection applications.

Abstract: Swept volume computation, the determination of regions occupied by moving
objects, is essential in graphics, robotics, and manufacturing. Existing
approaches either explicitly track surfaces, suffering from robustness issues
under complex interactions, or employ implicit representations that trade off
geometric fidelity and face optimization difficulties. We propose a novel
inversion of motion perspective: rather than tracking object motion, we fix the
object and trace spatial points backward in time, reducing complex trajectories
to efficiently linearizable point motions. Based on this, we introduce a multi
field tetrahedral framework that maintains multiple distance fileds per
element, preserving fine geometric details at trajectory intersections where
single field methods fail. Our method robustly computes swept volumes for
diverse motions, including translations and screw motions, and enables
practical applications in path planning and collision detection.

### [158] [Toward Precise Curve Offsetting Constrained to Parametric Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09333)
*Jin Zhao,Pengfei Wang,Shuangmin Chen,Jiong Guo,Shiqing Xin,Changhe Tu,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A novel Voronoi-based offset computation on parametric surfaces that represents a source curve as line segments and uses surface-constrained Voronoi regions to drive localized offsetting. It achieves accurate and fast offsets via intrinsic triangleization in parameter space and a plane-cut decomposition, with experimental results beating existing methods and enabling CAD/CAM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offsetting curves on parametric surfaces is essential in CAD/CAM. Traditional analytical methods are slow due to geodesic distance queries and complex self-intersection handling, while discrete approaches trade off precision. A new paradigm aims to be both faster and more accurate by localizing the computation on Voronoi cells.

Method: Represent the source curve as a sequence of line-segment primitives. Compute the offset by independently visiting the corresponding Voronoi cells constrained to the surface. To obtain the surface Voronoi, use (1) intrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic distances, and (2) decompose the triangulated parameter plane with a sequence of plane-cut operations instead of constructing the surface-constrained Voronoi directly. This yields a localized, efficient offsetting process.

Result: Experimental results indicate superior accuracy and runtime performance compared with existing methods. The approach is demonstrated on practical CAD/CAM tasks and applications.

Conclusion: The proposed Voronoi-based, surface-constrained offsetting paradigm is effective for curves on parametric surfaces, offering improved accuracy and efficiency and broad applicability to geometry processing tasks in CAD/CAM.

Abstract: Computing offsets of curves on parametric surfaces is a fundamental yet
challenging operation in computer aided design and manufacturing. Traditional
analytical approaches suffer from time-consuming geodesic distance queries and
complex self intersection handling, while discrete methods often struggle with
precision. In this paper, we propose a totally different algorithm paradigm.
Our key insight is that by representing the source curve as a sequence of line
segment primitives, the Voronoi decomposition constrained to the parametric
surface enables localized offset computation. Specifically, the offsetting
process can be efficiently traced by independently visiting the corresponding
Voronoi cells. To address the challenge of computing the Voronoi decomposition
on parametric surfaces, we introduce two key techniques. First, we employ
intrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic
distances. Second, instead of directly computing the surface-constrained
Voronoi decomposition, we decompose the triangulated parameter plane using a
series of plane cutting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior accuracy and runtime performance compared to
existing methods. We also present several practical applications enabled by our
approach.

*Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Affinita,Domenico D. Bloisi,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed, market-based coordination approach for multi-agent systems operating under severe bandwidth constraints, active and asymmetric obstacles, and partial observability. It reduces task overlaps and frequent reallocations, validated on NAO robots in RoboCup, yielding a 52% reduction in the most frequently reallocated task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) is hard when communication is limited and the environment contains highly active and asymmetric obstacles in partial observability. Existing methods often assume symmetric obstacles or reliable communication, limiting real-world applicability. The work aims to enable efficient, reallocation-aware task assignments in such challenging scenarios.

Method: A novel distributed coordination method inspired by market-based task assignment. It orchestrates autonomous agents' actions in low-communication settings and explicitly accounts for asymmetric obstacles, emphasizing frequent task reallocation in dynamic environments.

Result: Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps under limited communication, including a 52% decrease in the most frequently reallocated task. Validation was performed in both simulation and real-world experiments using NAO robots during RoboCup competitions.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively handles active, asymmetric obstacles under poor communication and partial observability, improving coordination efficiency. It is validated in both simulation and real-world robotics (RoboCup NAO team) and demonstrates potential for broader applicability in MAS with constrained communication.

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

TL;DR: 3DFiT enables continuous single-tow fiber reinforcement in a Face-Centered Cubic lattice to fabricate lightweight drone frames with high specific strength, outperforming conventional 3D printing and lighter than current frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for lightweight, high-strength composite structures in aerospace/robotics; conventional manufacturing struggles to achieve complex 3D architectures, creates weak joints, and maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement is challenging.

Method: Use 3D Fiber Tethering (3DFiT) with a continuous single tow fiber to construct a Face-Centered Cubic lattice drone frame, ensuring precise fiber alignment and eliminating weak joints from assembly; evaluate via mechanical tests and flight tests; frame weight ~260 g and comparison to existing frames.

Result: Frame achieves high specific strength (approximately 4–8 times that of metal and thermoplastics); weight is 260 g (about 10% lighter than a DJI F450); flight time extended by ~3 minutes; flight tests show stability and durability; 3DFiT is scalable and efficient for manufacturing.

Conclusion: Single-tow lattice truss drone frames manufactured via 3DFiT show strong potential for scalable, lightweight, high-strength frames with complex topology, offering performance gains over conventional composites and 3D printing methods.

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion uses Koopman-operator-based flow fields to guide robots along a reference trajectory, guaranteeing convergence to the trajectory’s end-point, with sample-efficient learning and strong empirical performance on both simulation datasets and a real robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman theory enables modeling of dynamical systems but does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories or goals; this is a key requirement for learning from demonstrations (LfD). There is a need for methods that ensure convergence to trajectories and goal-reaching when learning from demonstrations.

Method: Represent motion flow fields as dynamical systems parameterized by Koopman Operators; leverage the divergence properties of the learned flow fields to produce smooth motion fields that pull states toward a desired reference trajectory and then track it to the end-point; evaluate on LASA handwriting data, a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, and a physical robot (miniature autonomous surface vehicle) in a non-static fluid flow environment, including spectral analysis; report high sample efficiency (3% of LASA) and improvements over baselines on spatial/temporal metrics.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets and a physical robot, achieving dense motion plans with very limited training data and showing significant improvements over baselines on metrics assessing spatial and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: KoopMotion provides a convergent, sample-efficient, Koopman-operator-based framework for motion planning from demonstrations that can drive a robot from any initial state to a reference trajectory end-point and track along the trajectory, with validation in simulations and real-world experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM) combine a metamorphic arm with a passive gripper to achieve topology reconfiguration and adaptive grasping without extra actuators; PSO optimizes gripper dimensions; simulations show robust, versatile grasping across dynamic tasks, suggesting a scalable framework for efficient robotic loading solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and rigidity of fixed DoF loading mechanisms that rely on many actuators and complex control; pursue a low-actuation, adaptable solution for dynamic loading tasks.

Method: Develop a metamorphic arm that uses geometric constraints to reconfigure topology and generate flexible trajectories without additional actuators. Pair with a passively adaptive gripper driven by the arm. Build a structural model and perform kinetostatics analysis to study isomorphic grasp configurations. Use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize gripper dimensions for robust adaptability across applications.

Result: Simulation results validate a simple, easily implementable control strategy, demonstrate operational versatility, and show effective grasping of diverse objects in dynamic environments. The approach yields a generalizable modeling/optimization framework for underactuated metamorphic mechanisms.

Conclusion: Underactuated metamorphic mechanisms offer practical potential for efficient, adaptable loading solutions. The presented modeling and optimization framework is extensible to a broader class of manipulators, enabling scalable, robust performance with reduced actuation and control complexity.

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

TL;DR: A LIPM-inspired reward design enables perceptive, stable bipedal locomotion in unstructured outdoor environments by shaping CoM height and torso orientation, using a Reward Fusion Module to balance stability and velocity, and a double-critic framework; validated in sim and real-world trials showing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and perceptual limitations in wild terrain, where terrain geometry and disturbances threaten balance and camera viewpoint; existing methods struggle with stability under real-world perturbations.

Method: Design a LIPM-inspired reward function emphasizing CoM height and torso orientation; implement Reward Fusion Module to trade off velocity tracking and stability; employ a double-critic architecture to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives; validate in simulation and real outdoor experiments.

Result: Demonstrates superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across speeds and perceptual conditions; robust across various perceptual settings; improved training efficiency/robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed LIPM-inspired reward design with RFM and double-critic framework enhances stable, perceptive locomotion in the wild, enabling reliable terrain-aware balance and perception-driven control in real-world bipedal robots.

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

### [164] [AEOS: Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning Control for UAV LiDAR-Inertial Odometry in Complex Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09141)
*Jianping Li,Xinhang Xu,Zhongyuan Liu,Shenghai Yuan,Muqing Cao,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AEOS is a hybrid MPC+RL framework for adaptive LiDAR control on UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). It uses an analytical uncertainty model to exploit future observability and a lightweight neural network to learn a depth-based cost map for exploration, enabling sim-to-real trained, real-time odometry improvements under tight payload constraints and narrow FoV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact UAV LiDARs have narrow fields of view and payload limits, leading to poor scene awareness, occlusions, and degraded odometry in challenging environments when using fixed-rate or single-sensor setups. Inspired by owl active sensing, AEOS aims to actively control LiDAR scanning to maximize pose observability and mapping performance.

Method: A hybrid architecture combining model predictive control (MPC) with reinforcement learning (RL). An analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose observability to guide exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to steer exploration. A point-cloud-based simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps facilitates scalable sim-to-real training, enabling generalization across diverse scenes. The approach emphasizes real-time performance on onboard compute.

Result: In both simulation and real-world experiments, AEOS significantly improves odometry accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned baselines, while maintaining real-time performance within onboard computational constraints. The sim-to-real transfer is demonstrated using the developed environment and panoramic depth representations, with robust performance across occluded and cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: AEOS demonstrates that a biologically inspired, hybrid MPC-RL framework can substantially improve UAV LiDAR-based odometry by actively adjusting scanning to enhance observability under limited FoV and bandwidth, with strong generalization via sim-to-real training and practical real-time viability.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned

### [165] [Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206)
*Farhad Nawaz,Faizan M. Tariq,Sangjae Bae,David Isele,Avinash Singh,Nadia Figueroa,Nikolai Matni,Jovin D'sa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A probabilistic occupancy predictor for future parking spots combined with an information-gain-based planner improves autonomous valet parking by accounting for partial observations, predicted motion of dynamic agents, and adaptive exploration, including wait-and-go behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of methods relying on instantaneous observations or static assumptions in dynamic, uncertain parking environments; enable safer, more efficient, and smoother parking by reasoning about future occupancy.

Method: Introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that fuses partial/noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) and evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions; jointly design a strategy planner that balances goal-directed parking with information-gain-driven exploration and wait-and-go actions at promising spots; validate through randomized simulations of large parking lots.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared with existing approaches in large-scale, randomized parking lot simulations.

Conclusion: Integrating probabilistic future occupancy reasoning with information-gain planning enables safer and more efficient autonomous valet parking in dynamic environments; the approach effectively handles partial observations and uncertainty, and can be extended toward real-world deployments and richer agent models.

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

*Yueqi Zhang,Quancheng Qian,Taixian Hou,Peng Zhai,Xiaoyi Wei,Kangmai Hu,Jiafu Yi,Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-estimator framework (RENet) enables robust outdoor vision-based locomotion for quadrupeds by online adapting between estimation modules, improving deployment stability under perception noise and vision failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor quadruped locomotion relies on accurate environmental prediction and depth sensing, but depth noise and vision failures hinder reliable deployment. A robust, switchable estimation system is needed to maintain performance in challenging field conditions.

Method: Proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) with a dual-estimator architecture and online estimator adaptation to seamlessly transition between estimation modules when perception uncertainties arise, ensuring stable onboard vision-based control.

Result: Real-world experiments on a quadruped show improved motion robustness and deployment stability, especially in scenarios with degraded visual perception, validating the framework for challenging outdoor environments.

Conclusion: RENet provides a practical solution for reliable vision-based locomotion in outdoor field conditions by combining redundancy and online adaptation to handle perception noise and failures.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field
conditions. Project website: https://RENet-Loco.github.io/

*Yuecheng Liu,Dafeng Chi,Shiguang Wu,Zhanguang Zhang,Yuzheng Zhuang,Bowen Yang,He Zhu,Lingfeng Zhang,Pengwei Xie,David Gamaliel Arcos Bravo,Yingxue Zhang,Jianye Hao,Xingyue Quan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniEVA introduces a task-adaptive 3D grounding mechanism and embodiment-aware reasoning to advance embodied planning in multimodal LLM-based systems, addressing both geometric adaptability and real-robot embodiment constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work targets two gaps: (1) Geometric Adaptability Gap, where 2D-only or hard-coded 3D methods lack versatile spatial grounding and generalization across tasks with varying spatial demands; (2) Embodiment Constraint Gap, where plans may be theoretically valid but infeasible for real robots due to physical constraints.

Method: Two innovations: (1) Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding with a gated router that selectively regulates 3D fusion based on context to enable context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop to produce executable, goal-directed plans.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniEVA achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance and strong cross-scenario performance on a suite of primitive and composite embodied benchmarks, indicating robust and versatile planning capabilities.

Conclusion: OmniEVA effectively bridges geometry and embodiment gaps, enabling advanced, executable embodied planning for diverse tasks, and demonstrates superior generalization across primitive and composite tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

### [170] [A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404)
*Tongshun Chen,Zezhou Sun,Yanhan Sun,Yuhao Wang,Dezhen Song,Ke Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fatigue-aware cable-driven continuum robot with Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure, Passive Stopper, and real-time fatigue-estimation improves durability and enables online fatigue estimation, reducing fatigue by ~49% vs conventional design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fatigue due to plastic deformation and material degradation limits long-term operation of continuum robots; there is a need for fatigue estimation and safe operation in constrained/unstructured environments.

Method: Three innovations: 1) Hybrid Hinge-Beam decouples torsion and bending via TwistBeam and BendBeam with passive revolute joints; 2) Passive Stopper constrains motion and uses motor torque sensing to detect limit torque; 3) real-time fatigue-awareness method estimates stiffness from motor torque at limit pose to estimate fatigue without extra sensors.

Result: Experimental results show ~49% fatigue reduction compared to conventional design; passive mechanical limiting plus motor-side sensing enables accurate fatigue and damage estimation; demonstrates safe and reliable long-term operation.

Conclusion: The architecture is effective for safe, reliable long-term operation of continuum robots in constrained environments; fatigue-aware design improves durability and provides online estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm robotic bagging system using adaptive structure-of-interest manipulation with real-time vision, GMM-based SOI estimation, optimization for SOI generation, CBiRRT planning, and MPC coordination; demonstrates robust bagging across deformable bags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated bagging is challenging due to the deformable, unpredictable nature of bags; current methods often rely on predefined bag properties, limiting adaptability. Real-time feedback-enabled manipulation aims to handle variability and improve robustness in industrial settings.

Method: An adaptive SOI manipulation framework for dual arms with real-time visual feedback. Key components include: (1) GMMs to estimate SOI states, (2) optimization to generate SOIs, (3) motion planning via Constrained Bi-directional RRT (CBiRRT), and (4) dual-arm coordination using Model Predictive Control (MPC).

Result: The system achieves precise and robust bagging across a range of deformable objects, demonstrating strong adaptability to different bag properties without pre-programmed bag knowledge.

Conclusion: This work offers a new robotic solution for deformable object manipulation (DOM) in automated bagging tasks, leveraging real-time feedback and adaptive SOI strategies to overcome variability in bag properties.

Abstract: Bagging tasks, commonly found in industrial scenarios, are challenging
considering deformable bags' complicated and unpredictable nature. This paper
presents an automated bagging system from the proposed adaptive
Structure-of-Interest (SOI) manipulation strategy for dual robot arms. The
system dynamically adjusts its actions based on real-time visual feedback,
removing the need for pre-existing knowledge of bag properties. Our framework
incorporates Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for estimating SOI states,
optimization techniques for SOI generation, motion planning via Constrained
Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT), and dual-arm coordination
using Model Predictive Control (MPC). Extensive experiments validate the
capability of our system to perform precise and robust bagging across various

TL;DR: Open-hardware, multi-sensor SLAM platform (SMapper) with synchronized LiDAR, cameras, and IMU; releases SMapper-light dataset to improve reproducibility and benchmarking in SLAM research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing SLAM datasets: restricted sensing modalities, limited environmental diversity, and poor reproducibility of hardware setups, hindering reproducibility and fair benchmarking.

Method: Design and release SMapper as an open-hardware, multi-sensor platform with robust calibration and synchronization pipeline for precise spatio-temporal alignment; support handheld and robot-mounted setups; release SMapper-light with indoor/outdoor sequences, tightly synchronized multimodal data, ground-truth trajectories from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, and dense 3D reconstructions; provide benchmarking on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks.

Result: Introduces a new open-hardware platform and dataset, enabling reproducible data collection and comprehensive benchmarking; demonstrates practical utility via baselines on SMapper-light.

Conclusion: Open-hardware, reproducible SLAM datasets like SMapper can accelerate algorithm development, evaluation, and community adoption by providing versatile hardware, synchronized data, and standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and
reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

*Yanhui Lu,Zeyu Deng,Stephen J. Redmond,Efi Psomopoulou,Benjamin Ward-Cherrier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A neuromorphic tactile system using the NeuroTac sensor and a spiking convolutional neural network achieves 94.33% accuracy in three-class slip-state classification (no slip, incipient slip, gross slip) and detects incipient slip at least 360 ms before gross slip under gravity-induced conditions after temporal smoothing, indicating stable, energy-efficient edge deployment for slip detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early incipient slip detection is crucial to prevent object slippage and enhance manipulation safety, particularly on edge devices with limited energy budgets where conventional sensing may be impractical.

Method: A NeuroTac tactile sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin fed data into a spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN) trained to classify slip states (no slip, incipient slip, gross slip). Dynamics include slip scenarios induced by sensor motion and gravity-induced slip validation. Temporal smoothing of the final-layer spike counts is applied before decision making.

Result: Achieves 94.33% accuracy across three classes. Under dynamic gravity-induced slip validation, incipient slip is detected at least 360 ms before gross slip across all trials after temporal smoothing, demonstrating stable and responsive incipient slip detection.

Conclusion: The neuromorphic system demonstrates reliable, timely incipient slip detection suitable for energy-constrained edge platforms, enabling proactive intervention to prevent slips in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

*Sourav Garg,Dustin Craggs,Vineeth Bhat,Lachlan Mares,Stefan Podgorski,Madhava Krishna,Feras Dayoub,Ian Reid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an object-relative control paradigm for visual navigation on a topometric map, using a relative 3D scene graph and an ObjectReact controller conditioned on a WayObject Costmap, enabling embodiment-invariant, sim-to-real generalization without RGB input and decoupling control from image matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-level, pose-tied representations limit cross-embodiment transfer and generalization. An object-centric, map-anchored representation could provide embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world understanding, enabling robust navigation across sensor heights and between training and deployment settings.

Method: Introduce a topometric map as a relative 3D scene graph to produce object-level global path costs. Train a local controller (ObjectReact) conditioned on a high-level WayObject Costmap, eliminating the need for explicit RGB input. Compare object-relative control against image-relative baselines across varied sensor heights and navigation tasks, including reverse trajectories, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Object-relative control yields advantages over image-relative methods in cross-embodiment settings, with robustness to height variations and challenging navigation tasks. Demonstrates strong sim-to-real generalization in indoor environments.

Conclusion: Object-relative control, grounded in a relative 3D scene graph and WayObject Costmaps, offers embodiment- and trajectory-invariant navigation, decouples control from image matching, and improves cross-domain generalization, with practical sim-to-real applicability.

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

### [175] [MOFU: Development of a MOrphing Fluffy Unit with Expansion and Contraction Capabilities and Evaluation of the Animacy of Its Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09613)
*Taisei Mogi,Mari Saito,Yoshihiro Nakata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Volume-changing, expansion-contraction movements in MOFU increased perceived animacy, especially when combined with locomotion; dual robots did not show a clear animacy boost over a single unit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how whole-body volume-changing movements influence human perception of animacy, addressing a gap where most work focuses on appearance or limb movements rather than full-body expansion-contraction.

Method: Develop MOFU with a Jitterbug mechanism for smooth volume change (210–280 mm) and fluffy exterior; use a differential two-wheel drive. Conduct online survey with Godspeed questionnaires; compare (1) stationary MOFU with/without expansion-contraction and turning; (2) two MOFUs vs one; (3) four dual-robot motion conditions; (4) expansion-contraction with locomotion vs locomotion alone.

Result: Expansion-contraction significantly increased animacy in stationary conditions. Two MOFUs did not significantly outperform one. Among dual-robot conditions, results varied; when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion, animacy ratings exceeded locomotion alone.

Conclusion: Volume-changing body movements are a meaningful design element to enhance perceived animacy in social robots and should be considered in future development.

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

*Sirui Xu,Yu-Wei Chao,Liuyu Bian,Arsalan Mousavian,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dexplore presents a unified single-loop optimization to learn dexterous manipulation policies from motion-capture by jointly retargeting and tracking, treating demonstrations as soft guidance, scaling to large data, and distilling into a vision-based skill-conditioned controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstration data from hand-object MoCap is abundant but imperfect due to human-robot embodiment gaps and sensing noise; the traditional three-stage pipeline (retargeting, tracking, residual correction) wastes data and compounds errors; a unified approach is needed to leverage MoCap at scale.

Method: Proposes a single-loop optimization that jointly performs retargeting and tracking; uses adaptive spatial scopes derived from raw trajectories; trains with reinforcement learning to stay in task-relevant scope while minimizing control effort; treats demonstrations as soft guidance rather than ground truth; distills the learned policy into a vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller with a rich latent representation.

Result: Shows improved robustness to noise, can scale to large demonstration corpora, preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific strategies, and generalizes across objects; results in a scalable pipeline that can deploy to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Dexplore bridges imperfect MoCap demonstrations and effective dexterous manipulation by converting demonstrations into training signals through a unified optimization, enabling robust, scalable learning and transfer to vision-based policies.

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: An RL-based framework for Vision-Language-Action models that enhances long-horizon action planning in robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art results on LIBERO, outperforming pi_0 on RoboTwin, and surpassing SFT in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The two main issues hindering VLA: (i) scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, and (ii) limited generalization under distribution shifts. The authors propose RL as a means to improve long-horizon planning in VLA and reduce dependence on large-scale data.

Applied to OpenVLA-OFT; includes exploration-enhancing strategies and identifies a novel 'pushcut' phenomenon. Code available at GitHub. 

Result: Empirically, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and outperforms π0 on RoboTwin 1.0 & 2.0, while reducing reliance on large-scale data and enabling robust generalization. It also surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The results indicate that reinforcement learning can substantially improve long-horizon planning in Vision-Language-Action models. SimpleVLA-RL offers an efficient, scalable pathway to reduce data requirements and enhance generalization, and reveals a new RL-driven phenomenon 'pushcut' during training.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL
