### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight test-time augmentation called Class-Invariant TTA (CI-TTA) improves domain generalization by generating class-preserving elastic/grid variants of each input, filtering unreliable outputs, and aggregating predictions; it yields consistent gains across DG methods/backbones on PACS and Office-Home.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models suffer from distribution shifts; existing DG methods rely on multi-domain training or expensive test-time adaptation. There's a need for a lightweight, model-agnostic test-time strategy that can boost generalization without heavy retraining or adaptation.

Method: CI-TTA generates multiple deformed variants of each input using elastic and grid deformations that preserve the class. Predictions are aggregated, with a confidence-guided filter removing unreliable outputs, so final decision relies on consistent cues across variants.

Result: Empirical evaluation on PACS and Office-Home shows consistent performance gains across different DG algorithms and backbone architectures, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: CI-TTA provides a lightweight, general, and effective test-time augmentation strategy for domain generalization, complementing existing training-time DG methods and avoiding heavy computation or adaptation at test time.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken is a unified visual tokenizer that encodes images, videos, and 3D assets into a shared 4D latent space using a pure transformer with 4D rotary embeddings, enabling both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across modalities, trained with an adversarial-free objective; it supports continuous and discrete tokens and a progressive curriculum, delivering strong reconstruction and downstream generation/understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers are typically modality- or task-specific (reconstruction vs. understanding) and focus on a single modality, hindering cross-modal integration. A unified tokenizer could simplify multimodal AI systems and enable joint generation and understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets, while stable training without adversarial losses is desirable.

Method: A pure transformer with 4D rotary position embeddings processes inputs of arbitrary resolution and duration, encoding them into a shared 4D latent space. Training uses an adversarial-free objective combining perceptual and Gram matrix losses, and a progressive curriculum expands from single images to videos and 3D, supporting both continuous and discrete latent tokens.

Result: The approach yields strong reconstruction and understanding performance: 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. It enables downstream tasks such as image generation (continuous/discrete tokens), text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis, and multimodal LLMs, achieving competitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of a unified visual tokenizer across images, videos, and 3D assets, signaling a path toward next-generation multimodal AI systems built on unified tokenization that supports both reconstruction and semantic understanding.

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemEvo is a memory-evolving incremental multi-view clustering method that balances stability and plasticity via hippocampus-inspired view alignment, a cognitive forgetting mechanism, and prefrontal cortex-inspired consolidation, achieving strong knowledge retention as views grow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stability-plasticity dilemma in incremental multi-view clustering; inspired by hippocampal-prefrontal memory circuit to enable rapid adaptation to new views while preserving previous knowledge.

Method: Three modules: (1) hippocampus-inspired view alignment to extract gain info by aligning representations across views; (2) cognitive forgetting to decay weights of historical knowledge to prevent overfitting; (3) prefrontal cortex-inspired consolidation memory using temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate past knowledge; integrated to handle increasing number of views.

Result: Empirical experiments show MemEvo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in growing-view scenarios, with strong knowledge retention and improved stability-plasticity balance.

Conclusion: MemEvo provides a neuro-inspired framework that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in incremental multi-view clustering by combining alignment, forgetting, and consolidation mechanisms.

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edge-guided attention for SISR uses an adaptive modulation map derived from edge features and intermediate activations to normalize/reweight features, guiding the network to amplify structural regions and suppress spurious textures. It is integrated into a lightweight residual architecture trained with a pixel+perceptual+adversarial loss, yielding improved structure and perceptual quality with comparable model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image super-resolution is highly ill-posed, and existing edge-aware methods add priors or attention to increasingly complex backbones. Ad hoc fusion can cause redundancy, unstable optimization, or limited gains. A principled, edge-conditioned modulation can selectively emphasize structurally salient content while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Propose an edge-guided attention mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and reweight responses. Integrate this mechanism into a lightweight residual network trained with a composite loss (pixel-wise, perceptual, adversarial) to balance fidelity, realism, and stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard SISR benchmarks show consistent improvements in structural sharpness and perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at comparable model complexity.

Conclusion: Edge-conditioned modulation provides a parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, stabilizes adversarial refinement with a multiterm loss, and enhances edge fidelity without needing deeper architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of principled edge-guided attention for perceptual SISR.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive, diffusion-based iterative denoising for point clouds with noise-aware scheduling and two-stage training to fuse features and gradients, yielding superior denoising across varied noise patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud denoising must handle diverse noise levels and patterns efficiently; fixed, single-step denoisers often underperform across datasets.

Method: Estimate noise variation for each noisy cloud; design adaptive denoising schedule with variable step sizes; apply a trained score-based diffusion network iteratively; employ a two-stage sampling strategy during training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative updates.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic datasets with varied noises and on real-scanned data; produces clean, smooth point clouds with preserved boundaries and details.

Conclusion: An adaptive, diffusion-based iterative framework with noise-aware scheduling and specialized training strategies provides robust, high-quality denoising across noise patterns and real-world scans.

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL uses diffusion models to denoise noisy GPS for SD-map visual localization, achieving sub-meter accuracy without HD maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD maps offer precise localization but are costly to build/maintain, limiting scalability. SD maps (e.g., OpenStreetMap) are cheaper but provide noisy cues; current SD-map methods mainly rely on BEV matching and ignore GPS noise, which is problematic in urban multipath settings. There is a need to leverage readily available GPS as a probabilistic prior and use SD maps for scalable, accurate localization.

Method: Reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task. Condition diffusion-based pose refinement on visual BEV features and SD-map data to iteratively reverse GPS noise and recover the pose distribution. The model jointly learns GPS, SD map, and visual signals to map noisy observations to accurate poses without HD maps (sub-meter accuracy).

Result: Empirical results showing state-of-the-art accuracy against BEV-matching baselines, achieving sub-meter localization accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can enable scalable visual localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior, representing a paradigm shift from traditional BEV-matching to probabilistic pose refinement conditioned on multimodal cues.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE), a two-agent framework for sparse-view CT that blends diffusion-model priors with data-consistency constraints via a consensus process to enhance reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT suffers from undersampling, making reconstruction ill-posed. While traditional priors help, they struggle to capture complex medical image structures. Diffusion models offer strong generative priors, but integrating them with data fidelity in a principled way remains challenging.

Method: DICE embeds a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the diffusion model sampling: (i) a data-consistency agent enforcing measurement fidelity via a proximal operator, and (ii) a prior agent where a diffusion model performs clean image estimation at each sampling step. The method iteratively balances these agents to fuse prior knowledge with data consistency.

Result: Empirical results show DICE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for reconstructing high-quality CT images under both uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out of 180), demonstrating strong effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: DICE provides a practical and robust framework for combining diffusion priors with data-consistency constraints in sparse-view CT, achieving superior reconstruction quality and showing potential generalization to similar ill-posed inverse problems.

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

### [8] [Domain Adaptation for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation Using Patient-Level Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14573)
*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised domain adaptation method for Ulcerative Colitis severity estimation that uses patient-level diagnoses as weak supervision to align class-wise distributions across domains via Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity Triplet Loss, improving performance under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts caused by different imaging devices and clinical settings hinder Ulcerative Colitis severity estimation. Target-domain supervision is often unavailable or expensive, motivating a weakly supervised domain adaptation approach that leverages routinely recorded patient-level diagnoses.

Method: Proposes a Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation (WSDA) framework that uses patient-level diagnoses as weak labels in the target domain. It aligns class-wise distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and optimizes a Max-Severity Triplet Loss, which exploits the fact that a patient’s diagnosis is determined by the most severe region within their data.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms comparative domain adaptation methods, yielding improved UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates domain shift in UC severity estimation by leveraging weak supervision from patient-level diagnoses and region-based severity aggregation, offering a practical solution when target-domain annotations are scarce.

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A small urban-scene perception benchmark to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on objective and subjective judgments, using 100 Montreal street scenes (50 photos, 50 synthetic), with 230 annotations from 12 participants across 30 dimensions; zero-shot VLM evaluation shows stronger alignment on visible attributes; top model scores modestly; dataset and prompts released for reproducible evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people read city scenes and to create a benchmark for testing VLMs in urban perception, enabling participatory and uncertainty-aware evaluation for design and planning.

Method: 100 Montreal street images (split evenly between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes); 12 participants from 7 community groups provided 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions (mix of physical attributes and subjective impressions); French responses normalized to English; seven VLMs evaluated in zero-shot with a structured prompt and deterministic parser; performance metrics include accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement measured with Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard.

Result: Subjective appraisals show weaker alignment with models than objective, visible properties; top system claude-sonnet achieves macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items; higher human agreement tends to coincide with better model scores; synthetic images yield slightly lower scores.

Conclusion: Benchmark, prompts, and a harness are released to enable reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) for dynamic point cloud compression, replacing explicit motion vectors with spatiotemporal feature alignment and a random-access reference strategy; achieves substantial BD-Rate reductions and improves encoding/decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic point clouds have irregular structures and large local variations, making motion estimation difficult. Explicit motion vectors often fail to capture continuous temporal changes and temporal correlations, limiting compression efficiency and processing performance.

Method: FMT uses aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding to implicitly model continuous temporal variations, replacing explicit motion vectors. A random access (RA) reference strategy enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding to support frame-level parallel compression.

Result: The method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in encoding and decoding efficiency, achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%, respectively.

Conclusion: FMT effectively improves compression efficiency and processing performance for dynamic point clouds by implicit motion modeling and RA-based encoding, demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba advances 3D medical image segmentation by balancing local detail and global context through dual pathways and a spatial-frequency gated module, achieving state-of-the-art results on MRI/CT and introducing a multi-center lung CT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba improves long-range modeling over CNNs and reduces Transformer overhead but risks boundary blurring when emphasizing global context; a method is needed to preserve local structure while leveraging global information.

Method: Proposes two complementary mechanisms: (1) feature scanning that progressively integrates representations via axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize local/global relationships; (2) a gated module that combines spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling; additionally collects a multi-center CT dataset for lung cancer; evaluates on MRI and CT datasets.

Result: HybridMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation on MRI and CT benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dual-path feature scanning plus spatial-frequency gating effectively balance local and global context, improving segmentation quality; the multi-center CT dataset supports broad validation.

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

### [12] [Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610)
*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block for U-like networks in medical image segmentation that mitigates fixed skip-path limitations by combining a Test-Time Training (TTT) module for content-aware dynamic refinement with a Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module for adaptive multi-scale context, offering architecture-agnostic plug-and-play integration and improved cross-layer connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skip connections in U-shaped networks suffer from inter-feature constraints (static, fixed information mixing) and intra-feature constraints (insufficient multi-scale context aggregation). The paper seeks to enable dynamic, content-aware, and multi-scale feature fusion to enhance segmentation performance.

Method: Introduce the DSC block with two components: (1) TTT module that enables dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, addressing inter-feature constraints; (2) DMSK module that adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global context to improve multi-scale feature integration. The block is architecture-agnostic and can be plugged into CNN-, Transformer-, hybrid-, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

Result: Extensive experiments show the DSC block is plug-and-play effective across diverse backbones, improving cross-layer connectivity and multi-scale feature fusion for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: The DSC block provides a simple yet powerful augmentation for U-like networks, enabling dynamic, content-aware skip connections and adaptive multi-scale context aggregation, compatible with a wide range of architectures.

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

### [13] [LSTC-MDA: A Unified Framework for Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution and Mixed Data Augmentation in Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14619)
*Feng Ding,Haisheng Fu,Soroush Oraki,Jie Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified LSTC-MDA framework improves skeleton-based action recognition by combining long-short temporal convolution with adaptive fusion and enhanced data augmentation (Additive Mixup within JMDA) to tackle data scarcity and temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art on NTU-60/120 and NW-UCLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two core challenges: scarcity of labeled training data and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies in skeleton-based action recognition, while preserving long-range cues lost by stride-2 convolutions and reducing distribution shifts in augmentation.

Method: Propose Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) with parallel short- and long-term branches whose features are aligned and fused via learned similarity weights; extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with Additive Mixup at the input and constrain mixup to the same camera view; validate with ablation studies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 94.1%/97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub/X-View), 90.4%/92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub/X-Set), and 97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: LSTC-MDA effectively enhances temporal modeling and data diversity in skeleton-based action recognition, with ablations confirming the contribution of both the LSTC module and the augmented JMDA approach.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new MultiEdit dataset with 107K image-editing samples across 6 editing tasks (18 non-style-transfer types, 38 style-transfer operations), built via two MLLMs to generate instructions and edits; improves fine-tuned models on challenging edits while preserving standard editing performance; public on HuggingFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing datasets are limited in editing types and sample counts, and noisy image-caption pairs can bias models, hindering performance on complex tasks. A diverse, high-quality dataset is needed to push IBIE capabilities.

Method: Construct dataset using a two-stage, multimodal LLM pipeline: one model generates visual-adaptive editing instructions, the other produces high-fidelity edited images. The dataset includes 6 editing tasks, 18 non-style-transfer types and 38 style-transfer operations (ranging from advanced style transfer to complex semantic edits). A robust pipeline ensures data quality and diversity for training and evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuning open-source base models with MultiEdit-Train yields substantial gains on sophisticated editing tasks in MultiEdit-Test, while preserving performance on standard editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: MultiEdit provides a valuable, diverse resource to advance IBIE research and capabilities; the dataset is publicly available at HuggingFace.

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

*Shinnosuke Hirano,Yuiga Wada,Tsumugi Iida,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA) to generate visual explanations in visual foundation models, improving interpretability and adaptability; achieves leading explainability metrics on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S, including a notable 53.2-point mean IoU gain on CUB-200-2011.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing explanation methods in complex visual foundation models—namely, poor adaptability and reliance on manual layer selection—by enabling simultaneous explanation and partial model parameter updates to boost interpretability.

Method: Propose ALA to eliminate manual layer selection and enhance adaptability; pair with AEA which updates ALA parameters every other epoch to prevent overly small attention regions; evaluate on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S using mean IoU, insertion score, deletion score, and insertion-deletion score.

Result: OMP: The method outperforms baselines on both datasets across all metrics (mean IoU, insertion score, deletion score, and insertion-deletion score); best model achieves a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on CUB-200-2011 compared with baselines.

Conclusion: ALA and AEA enhance explainability by enabling adaptable, interpretable visual explanations in foundation models, delivering substantial quantitative gains and suggesting broad applicability.

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

*Kazuma Nagata,Naoshi Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN uses foundation-model semantic features with multi-reference inputs to robustly colorize line drawings, outperforming prior single/multi-reference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic colorization of line drawings is hampered by occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes; existing methods often rely on limited reference images (one or two) and struggle with generalization.

Method: DACoN fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs to extract robust, part-level semantics from line drawings. It removes the constraint of a fixed number of references by supporting any number of reference images and leverages those references to guide colorization.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using multiple reference images improves colorization performance, with DACoN achieving superior results compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: DACoN provides a scalable, robust colorization framework for line drawings by combining foundation-model semantics with CNN features and unlimited references; code and model are publicly available.

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available

### [17] [FMGS-Avatar: Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting with Foundation Model Priors for 3D Monocular Avatar Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14739)
*Jinlong Fan,Bingyu Hu,Xingguang Li,Yuxiang Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mesh-guided 2D Gaussian splatting framework (FMGS-Avatar) augments monocular 3D avatars by attaching 2D Gaussians to template mesh faces, constrained in pose/rotation, plus distilling priors from foundation models (e.g., Sapiens) with gradient isolation to avoid conflicting losses. It claims improved geometry and appearance, and temporal/spatial consistency in a shared canonical space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limited geometric information in monocular videos and the surface detail loss in free-form 3D Gaussian representations by grounding 2D Gaussians to a template mesh and leveraging large-scale priors for richer cues.

Method: 1) Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting: attach 2D Gaussian primitives to template mesh faces with constrained pose and motion to improve surface alignment and detail. 2) Foundation-model distillation: use priors from large datasets (e.g., Sapiens) to complement monocular cues. 3) Coordinated training with selective gradient isolation to prevent conflicting optimization among modalities, ensuring each loss optimizes relevant parameters.

Result: Reported superior reconstruction quality versus existing methods, with gains in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity, plus rich semantic information. Distilled priors enable consistent rendering across novel views/poses in a shared canonical space.

Conclusion: FMGS-Avatar offers a hybrid representation combining mesh-guided 2D Gaussian splats and foundation-model priors, with a training strategy that isolates gradients to manage multi-modal losses, yielding improved 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction and stable novel-view/rendering.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

### [18] [Chain-of-Thought Re-ranking for Image Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14746)
*Shangrong Wu,Yanghong Zhou,Yang Chen,Feng Zhang,P. Y. Mok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoTRR enables multimodal LLMs to directly participate in image ranking via listwise prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results on TIR, CIR, and Chat-IR across five datasets with interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but are underutilized in ranking tasks; leveraging them could improve global consistency, interpretability, and performance in image retrieval.

Method: Introduce CoTRR with three prompts: (1) a listwise ranking prompt that lets the MLLM rank candidate images; (2) an image evaluation prompt that assesses alignment with the user query; (3) a query deconstruction prompt that decomposes the query into semantic components, enabling structured analysis.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on three image retrieval tasks (TIR, CIR, Chat-IR) across five datasets.

Conclusion: Directly engaging MLLMs in the ranking process with structured prompting yields improved retrieval accuracy, global reasoning, and interpretable decisions, and the approach is validated on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

*Ahmed Sheta,Mathias Zinnen,Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation improves detection of smell-related objects in historic artworks, addressing annotation sparsity and class imbalance, with large-scale pretraining offering benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing odor-related objects in artworks is challenging due to niche classes and uneven annotations; synthetic data from diffusion models could alleviate data scarcity and cost.

Method: Evaluate several diffusion-based augmentation strategies; integrate synthetic data into training; leverage large-scale diffusion pretraining; assess effectiveness on smell-related object detection with limited annotations.

Result: Incorporating synthetic data boosts detection performance; gains persist with small datasets; scaling synthetic data and pretraining promises further improvements.

Conclusion: Diffusion-model-based synthetic augmentation is a promising, scalable approach for niche detection tasks in art history, enabling better accuracy where annotations are scarce and costly.

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

*Marija Brkic,Anas Filali Razzouki,Yannis Tevissen,Khalil Guetari,Mounim A. El Yacoubi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a frame-accurate benchmark for video VLMs to address frame-sampling bias; finds bias across datasets and tasks; provides open-source code for reproducible evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video VLM benchmarks are contaminated by inconsistent frame-sampling strategies, making cross-model comparisons unreliable; there is a need for standardized, frame-accurate evaluation tailored to each dataset.

Method: Proposes the first frame-accurate benchmark for state-of-the-art small VLMs on video question answering, evaluating models under controlled frame-sampling strategies, and analyzing data- and task-specific behaviors; code is open-sourced.

Result: Experiments reveal substantial frame-sampling bias and show that SVLMs' performance varies in data- and task-specific ways depending on the sampling strategy; benchmarking is now reproducible under a standardized protocol.

Conclusion: Standardized, frame-accurate sampling protocols per dataset are essential for fair evaluation of video VLMs; releasing benchmarks enables reproducible, unbiased comparisons.

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

### [21] [A Real-Time Multi-Model Parametric Representation of Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14773)
*Yuan Gao,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time, multi-model parametric representation for point clouds is proposed, combining Gaussian mixture model (GMM) segmentation with extraction of planes and curved surfaces (via B-splines), using a 2D voxel boundary; it achieves higher robustness and up to ~3.8x efficiency and ~2x accuracy gains over GMM alone, running at 36.4 fps on low-power hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, accurate surface detection and fitting on point clouds without resorting to heavy, highly parametric models, by leveraging simple primitives (planes and B-spline surfaces) and a robust segmentation step.

Method: 1) Segment the point cloud with a Gaussian mixture model into multiple clusters. 2) Identify flat clusters and merge them into planes; bound them with a 2D voxel-based boundary. 3) For curved surfaces, fit B-spline surfaces with the same boundary description. 4) Evaluate on public datasets to compare robustness and efficiency.

Result: The method shows greater robustness than the state-of-the-art and improves efficiency by about 3.78x. It also achieves about 2x accuracy gain over plain Gaussian mixture models, while running at 36.4 frames per second on a low-power onboard computer.

Conclusion: A practical, real-time surface detection and fitting approach for point clouds that balances computational efficiency with expressive capability by combining GMM-based segmentation with plane and B-spline surface fitting, underpinned by a boundary description via 2D voxels.

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

### [22] [Dataset Distillation for Super-Resolution without Class Labels and Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14777)
*Sunwoo Cho,Yejin Jung,Nam Ik Cho,Jae Woong Soh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based data distillation method for single image super-resolution that does not require class labels or pre-trained SR models; it distills from high-gradient patches clustered by CLIP features and fine-tunes a diffusion model to synthesize distilled training images, achieving state-of-the-art results with dramatically less data and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data inefficiency in SR and reliance on pre-trained models; limitations of GAN-inversion-based distillation needing class information; need for a generalizable, label-free approach.

Method: Extract high-gradient patches; cluster images using CLIP features; fine-tune a diffusion model on selected patches to learn their distribution; synthesize distilled training images from the tuned diffusion model; train SR model on distilled set.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.68% of the original dataset; SR performance drops by only 0.3 dB; diffusion fine-tuning takes 4 hours; SR training completes in 1 hour vs 11 hours with full data.

Conclusion: Shows that SR data distillation can be achieved without labels or pre-trained SR models, enabling high data efficiency and faster training while maintaining performance, indicating potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Report2CT uses radiology-report conditioned 3D latent diffusion with multi-encoder text conditioning to synthesize clinically faithful chest CTs from free text. It achieves state-of-the-art results on MICCAI 2025 VLM3D and improves text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D CT generation with diffusion models lags behind; full radiology reports contain rich semantic details that can enhance text-to-CT synthesis, improving clinical fidelity and usefulness for augmentation and research.

Method: A radiology-report conditioned latent diffusion framework (Report2CT) for 3D CT synthesis conditioned on findings and impression. It uses three pretrained medical text encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, ClinicalBERT) and voxel spacing information. The model is trained on 20,000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset. Comparative evaluation includes GenerateCT; classifier-free guidance is used to boost alignment.

Result: Report2CT delivers anatomically consistent 3D CT volumes with excellent visual quality and better text-image alignment. Multi-encoder conditioning improves CLIP-based alignment; classifier-free guidance further enhances alignment with only slight FID trade-offs. It ranked first in the VLM3D MICCAI 2025 Text Conditional CT Generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across metrics.

Conclusion: Leveraging complete radiology reports and multi-encoder text conditioning advances 3D CT synthesis, yielding clinically faithful, high-quality synthetic CT data and demonstrating strong potential for data augmentation and clinical research.

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

*Liheng Wang,Licheng Zhang,Hailin Xu,Jingxin Zhao,Xiuyun Su,Jiantao Li,Miutian Tang,Weilu Gao,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fracture-aware fracture interactive geodesic active contour for bone segmentation that fuses an intensity–gradient edge detector with fracture-aware adaptive evolution to robustly segment bones amid fractures and soft tissues; validated on pelvic and ankle bones with accurate, stable results and potential for integration with deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geodesic active contours struggle with edge obstruction, edge leakage, and bone fractures, leading to mis-segmentation when soft tissues obscure bone edges. There is a need for a robust, interactive method that leverages orthopedic knowledge to accurately delineate bones even in fracture regions.

Method: Introduce fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm. Design a novel edge-detector that combines intensity and gradient norm to guide contours toward bone edges while avoiding soft tissues. Incorporate distance information and fracture prompts as adaptive step sizes to stabilize evolution and stop at bone edges and fractures. Provide interactive mechanism to embed fracture information and show applicability to pelvic and ankle bone segmentation.

Result: Experiments on pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrate improved handling of edge obstruction, edge leakage, and fractures, yielding accurate, stable, and consistent segmentation. The approach shows potential for broader application across other bone anatomies and offers a path to integrate domain knowledge with deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The fracture-aware contour method enhances bone segmentation robustness in fracture regions by fusing domain knowledge with adaptive evolution, with strong implications for broader bone segmentation tasks and potential synergy with data-driven approaches.

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

*Patrick Madlindl,Fabian Bongratz,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss as a regularizer for learning-based cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) to promote low-energy deformation trajectories and improve training consistency. Integrated with the V2C-Flow model, MED yields better reproducibility without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy or topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based CSR often focuses on accuracy (e.g., Chamfer distance) but overlooks the energy efficiency of deformation and the stability/reproducibility of results across training runs. Ensuring low-energy deformations and consistent training is important for robust neuroimage analysis.

Method: Define MED loss as a regularizer on deformation trajectories (minimizing deformation energy) and combine it with the Chamfer distance. Incorporate MED into the V2C-Flow CSR framework and evaluate its impact on training consistency, reproducibility, reconstruction accuracy, and topological correctness across runs.

Result: MED improves training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy or topological correctness, demonstrating the value of energy-aware regularization in CSR.

Conclusion: Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) is a beneficial regularizer for learning-based CSR, addressing deformation energy and training stability. It can be integrated into existing models like V2C-Flow to enhance reliability of reconstructions.

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and

*Alvaro Lopez Pellicer,Andre Mariucci,Plamen Angelov,Marwan Bukhari,Jemma G. Kerns*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoMedX is a prototype-based, explainable, multi-modal AI model that combines DEXA scans and patient records to classify bone health, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (87.58% vision-only, 89.8% multi-modal) on NHS data and providing clinician-friendly explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for explainable AI in medical imaging and patient data analysis, especially for bone health screening and under regulatory regimes like the EU AI Act. Vision-only models often lack interpretability; integrating clinical data with DEXA and providing built-in explanations can improve trust and adoption.

Method: ProtoMedX employs a prototype-based multi-modal architecture that ingests DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. It offers explanations by design via prototype reasoning, enabling explicit analysis of decisions (including incorrect ones). The model was evaluated on a dataset of 4,160 NHS patients, comparing vision-only and multi-modal variants against existing methods.

Result: The model achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% accuracy in its multi-modal variant, surpassing previously published methods. It also provides explanations that are visually interpretable by clinicians.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX demonstrates that a explainable, prototype-based, multi-modal approach can achieve strong performance in bone health classification while offering interpretable insights, aligning with regulatory expectations and supporting clinical adoption.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

*Miriam Louise Carnot,Jonas Kunze,Erik Fastermann,Eric Peukert,André Ludwig,Bogdan Franczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapAnything automates geolocation of urban objects from single images using metric depth estimation, validated against LiDAR; supports automatic urban asset and incident mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban administrations face growing data needs for up-to-date geocoordinates of signs, trees, and incidents, but manual updates are labor-intensive.

Method: Employ metric depth estimation models to estimate object-camera distance; apply geometric principles and camera parameters to compute geocoordinates; validate by comparing to LiDAR point clouds; analyze by distance and semantic area; present use cases with traffic signs and road damage.

Result: Demonstrates the module's ability to estimate distances with respect to LiDAR data across urban scenes; performance varies by distance bands and semantic category; practical applicability shown in concrete tasks.

Conclusion: MapAnything offers a path toward automated urban object/incident mapping, reducing manual effort, with validation across scenes; limitations likely depend on depth model accuracy and camera calibration.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic
signs and road damage.

### [28] [Not All Degradations Are Equal: A Targeted Feature Denoising Framework for Generalizable Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14841)
*Hongjun Wang,Jiyuan Chen,Zhengwei Yin,Xuan Song,Yinqiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A noise-focused, plug-and-play feature denoising framework improves generalizable image super-resolution by detecting and denoising noise, outperforming prior regularization methods on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable SR seeks to avoid overfitting to unknown degradations, but models tend to overfit primarily to noise due to its distinct degradation pattern. A targeted denoising approach can suppress noise-driven features while preserving content.

Method: Introduce a targeted feature denoising framework with two plug-in modules: (i) a noise detection module to identify noise-sensitive regions, and (ii) a denoising module to suppress noise-induced features. The framework integrates with existing SR models without architectural changes.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to previous regularization-based approaches across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, covering both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: A general, plug-and-play denoising framework effectively mitigates noise overfitting and enhances SR generalization under unknown degradations without modifying SR architectures.

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

### [29] [[Re] Improving Interpretation Faithfulness for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14846)
*Izabela Kurek,Wojciech Trejter,Stipe Frkovic,Andro Erdelez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reproduces and extends the Faithful Vision Transformers (FViTs) framework with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) for interpretability of Vision Transformers, validating claims that DDS improves robustness to segmentation and classification attacks, and extending this idea to apply DDS to any interpretability method (including Attribution Rollout). It also evaluates computational and environmental costs, finding broad agreement with the original study with minor discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the robustness benefits claimed for DDS-enhanced interpretability in Vision Transformers and to test whether adding DDS to various interpretability methods yields universal robustness gains, while also assessing practical costs associated with producing FViTs through DDS.

Method: Reproduce the FViT framework and results from arXiv:2311.17983; apply Diffusion Denoised Smoothing to interpretability methods as in arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022); evaluate robustness on segmentation tasks and on classification tasks under perturbations/attacks; extend experiments to add DDS to the Attribution Rollout method and to baseline interpretability methods; measure computational cost and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT via DDS.

Result: Results broadly align with the original study, supporting the claim that DDS improves interpretability robustness in the tested scenarios; minor discrepancies were observed and discussed in the paper.

Conclusion: DDS can enhance interpretability robustness for Vision Transformers and may benefit other interpretability methods when augmented with DDS, but this comes with computational and environmental costs; replication confirms the key claims while acknowledging caveats and minor deviations.

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers
(FViTs) proposed by arXiv:2311.17983 alongside interpretability methods for
Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

*Wonduk Seo,Minhyeong Yu,Hyunjin An,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARIC introduces a multi-agent reasoning framework for image classification that decomposes understanding into global outlining, multi-perspective feature extraction, and reflective fusion to produce robust and interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-pass vision-language models struggle to capture complementary visual cues and require heavy parameter training; there is a need for collaborative reasoning and interpretable multi-perspective analysis in image classification.

Method: MARIC uses a hierarchical agent suite: an Outliner Agent identifies the image's global theme and generates targeted prompts; three Aspect Agents extract fine-grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions based on those prompts; a Reasoning Agent performs an integrated reflection to fuse these outputs into a unified representation for classification.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four diverse image classification datasets shows MARIC outperforms baselines by leveraging multi-agent visual reasoning, achieving robustness and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: Decomposing image understanding into multiple perspectives and reflecting to synthesize them yields better performance and interpretability than monolithic single-pass models or heavy parameter-training approaches.

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

*Ali Salar,Qing Liu,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based anonymization framework that uses an adaptive attribute-guidance gradient correction during reverse denoising to generate realistic, controllable anonymized portraits, including localized anonymization, with no extra training; outperforms SOTA on CelebA-HQ/FFHQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect personal identities in portrait data while preserving usefulness for downstream computer vision tasks; existing anonymization methods often trade off privacy and utility or require retraining.

Method: Leverages latent diffusion models for inpainting and introduces an adaptive attribute-guidance module that applies gradient corrections during the reverse denoising process to align facial attributes with a synthesized target image. Supports localized anonymization by allowing users to specify facial regions to remain unchanged; requires no additional model training.

Result: Experimentally demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art anonymization methods on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets; code is released on the authors' page.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers precise, controllable anonymization with realistic outputs and regional control without additional training, improving privacy-utility balance for portrait data.

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

*Ivana Janíčková,Yen Y. Tan,Thomas H. Helbich,Konstantin Miloserdov,Zsuzsanna Bago-Horvath,Ulrike Heber,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A representation-learning approach on longitudinal MRI trajectories predicts pathological complete response in breast cancer during NACT, with accuracy improving as more imaging time points are used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized therapy decisions require early, accurate prediction of treatment response; existing heterogeneity and disease progression limit current models; leveraging early dynamic imaging could improve predictions.

Method: A multi-task model learns a latent trajectory representation from longitudinal MRI data; trajectories capture appearance changes and temporal continuity; a linear classifier operates in latent space to predict pCR; evaluated on ISPY-2 dataset using T0, T0+T1, T0->T3.

Result: Balanced accuracies: 0.761 (T0), 0.811 (T0+T1), 0.861 (T0->T3).

Conclusion: Early imaging dynamics in the latent space enable effective pCR prediction; performance improves with more time points; code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

*Antoine Legrand,Renaud Detry,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A NeRF-based visual explainer, trained via gradients from a pose estimator, reveals the 3D cues that drive data-driven spacecraft pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase trust, interpretability, and reliability of learned 6D pose estimators for on-orbit servicing by exposing the 3D features they rely on.

Method: Train a NeRF image generator whose rendering is guided by backpropagated gradients from the pose estimation network, forcing the generator to render the main 3D features used by the estimator.

Result: The method recovers the relevant 3D cues and provides insights into how supervision shapes the implicit representation of the target spacecraft within the estimator.

Conclusion: The proposed visualization framework enhances interpretability of data-driven spacecraft pose estimation and can inform training and architecture design to improve transparency and robustness.

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference approach for VOS with SAM2Long and SeC achieves SOTA-like performance on MOSE, placing 2nd in LSVOS 2025 VOS Track.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle challenging VOS scenarios with small/fast/occluded objects and long video sequences; improve accuracy and temporal stability by leveraging pseudo-labels and multi-model fusion.

Method: Train with pseudo-labels generated by a SAM2 checkpoint within SAM2Long on MOSE test set; train on augmented data; during inference, run SAM2Long as primary and SeC in parallel; use cascaded decision to fuse outputs leveraging temporal stability and concept-level robustness.

Result: J&F score 0.8616 on MOSE test set; +1.4 over SAM2Long baseline; achieved 2nd place in LSVOS 2025 VOS Track.

Conclusion: Pseudo-label training plus cascaded multi-model inference yields robust and accurate long video segmentation; demonstrates strength in complex scenarios; potential for future improvements via ensemble strategies.

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

### [35] [Trade-offs in Cross-Domain Generalization of Foundation Model Fine-Tuned for Biometric Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14921)
*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning CLIP for biometric tasks (FR, MAD, PAD) boosts task-specific performance but reduces cross-domain generalization, with larger models mitigating but not eliminating the forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify the trade-offs between specialization and cross-domain generalization when fine-tuning foundation models for biometric tasks (face recognition, morphing attack detection, and presentation attack detection).

Method: Fine-tune three CLIP variants for FR, MAD, and PAD; evaluate each adapted model and the original CLIP baseline on 14 general-vision datasets under zero-shot and linear-probe protocols, plus standard FR/MAD/PAD benchmarks to assess generalization vs task performance.

Result: Fine-tuned models exhibit over-specialization, especially for FR. Task complexity and whether the task is multi-class (FR) or binary (MAD/PAD) correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The ViT-L FR model attains up to 58.52% improvement on the large IJB-C benchmark but falls on ImageNetV2 to 51.63% from 69.84% for baseline CLIP. Larger CLIP architectures consistently retain more of the original generalization ability, suggesting higher capacity helps mitigate over-specialization.

Conclusion: There is a clear trade-off between task-specific gains and preservation of generalization. Increasing model capacity helps, but over-specialization persists, particularly for complex, multi-class biometric tasks; practitioners should balance biometric performance gains with potential losses in broad-vision transfer, and explore design choices (e.g., head type, adapters, or multi-task training) to preserve generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-LLaVA leverages latent knowledge from multi-modal LLMs to improve synthetic image detection, achieving high accuracy while preserving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors either output binary/forgery probabilities with little explanation or rely on MLLMs that lag in accuracy; there's a need for models that combine strong detection performance with human-interpretable reasoning.

Method: Extract latent knowledge from MLLMs and inject it into training via prompts, enabling LLaVA to leverage the discrimination potential of MLLMs while maintaining interpretability.

Result: DF-LLaVA achieves higher detection accuracy than expert models and retains the interpretability benefits of MLLMs, with extensive experiments supporting its superiority for synthetic image detection.

Conclusion: A simple, effective framework that marries MLLMs’ interpretability with strong detection performance, enabling explainable and accurate synthetic image detection; code is publicly available.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMGR enables cross-modal rectification to improve 3D open-world few-shot incremental learning by aligning 3D geometry with CLIP's spatial priors, augmenting textures minimally, and stabilizing prototypes with a base-novel discriminator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address extreme data scarcity and semantic blurring in 3D open-world class-incremental learning due to geometric misalignment and texture bias when fusing 3D data with 2D foundation models like CLIP.

Method: Introduce three components: (1) Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors via attention-driven geometric fusion; (2) Texture Amplification Module that synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency; (3) Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations to stabilize incremental prototypes.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, with superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Conclusion: CMGR advances open-world 3D recognition by jointly enhancing geometric fidelity and texture handling, leading to more stable and robust incremental learning under limited data.

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Brain-HGCN, a hyperbolic GNN for fMRI networks to capture brain hierarchy; uses Lorentz-space hyperbolic graph attention with signed aggregation and Fréchet-mean readout; achieves state-of-the-art results on psychiatric disorder classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain networks show hierarchical organization and negative curvature; Euclidean GNNs distort this structure due to spatial constraints, limiting clinical performance. Hyperbolic geometry offers a more faithful representation of hierarchy, motivating a geometry-aware model for fMRI analysis.

Method: Brain-HGCN operates in hyperbolic space (Lorentz model) with a hyperbolic graph attention layer that uses signed aggregation to separately process excitatory and inhibitory connections. Graph-level representations are learned via a Fréchet mean readout in hyperbolic space; evaluated on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric disorder classification.

Result: The method significantly outperforms a broad set of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines on the two datasets, demonstrating robust and faithful modeling of brain hierarchy and improved classification performance.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel geometric DL paradigm for fMRI analysis; hyperbolic GNNs effectively capture brain hierarchy, with strong potential for computational psychiatry applications and broader clinical use.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

### [40] [RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D Geometric Keypoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14966)
*Xingwu Zhang,Guanxuan Li,Zhuocheng Zhang,Zijun Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboEye is a two-stage RGB-only object identification framework that adds selective 3D reasoning to 2D features to boost Recall@1. It uses a gating module to decide when to apply a 3D re-ranking, achieving a 7.1 percentage-point improvement over RoboLLM and reducing costs by avoiding always-on 3D processing. Code is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large-scale catalogs, intra-class variability, long-tail items, clutter, occlusion, and view changes degrade 2D-only methods. Incorporating domain-adapted 3D reasoning improves robustness while keeping computation and deployment costs low by not always performing 3D processing.

Method: Stage 1 trains a large vision model to extract 2D features and generate candidate rankings; a lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module predicts 3D feature quality and whether 3D re-ranking is needed. Stage 2, when invoked, uses a robot 3D retrieval transformer with a geometry-aware 3D feature extractor and a keypoint-based matcher that outputs keypoint-correspondence confidences rather than cosine similarity. The approach relies on RGB inputs only; code is publicly available.

Result: Recall@1 improves by 7.1 percentage points over RoboLLM, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive 2D+3D retrieval and RGB-only operation with reduced deployment costs.

Conclusion: An adaptive, two-stage retrieval framework that balances accuracy and computation, leveraging selective 3D reasoning to bolster robustness in cluttered warehouse imagery without requiring explicit 3D data.

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code
used in this paper is publicly available at:

### [41] [Beyond Random Masking: A Dual-Stream Approach for Rotation-Invariant Point Cloud Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14975)
*Xuanhua Yin,Dingxin Zhang,Yu Feng,Shunqi Mao,Jianhui Yu,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces dual-stream masking (3D Spatial Grid Masking + Progressive Semantic Masking) with curriculum learning to improve rotation-invariant point cloud MAEs; plug-and-play across architectures; achieves consistent gains on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, OmniObject3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in rotation-invariant MAEs ignores geometric consistency and semantic parts across rotations, hindering learning of spatial relationships and identity of parts.

Method: Proposes two masking streams: grid masking created by coordinate sorting to capture geometric relationships across orientations; semantic masking via attention-driven clustering to identify semantically meaningful parts; curriculum learning with dynamic weighting to blend geometric and semantic cues; no architectural changes, plug-and-play.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements across rotation scenarios and datasets, with substantial gains over baseline rotation-invariant methods.

Conclusion: Dual-stream masking effectively addresses core limitations, is broadly compatible, and enhances the performance of rotation-invariant point cloud MAEs.

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

### [42] [EchoVLM: Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Vision-Language Model for Universal Ultrasound Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14977)
*Chaoyin She,Ruifang Lu,Lida Chen,Wei Wang,Qinghua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-specific vision-language model for ultrasound (EchoVLM) uses a Mixture of Experts to enable multi-task ultrasound understanding (report generation, diagnosis, VQA) across seven anatomical regions, outperforming a baseline on report-generation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound excels as a safe, cheap, real-time imaging modality but diagnosis is highly dependent on clinician expertise, leading to subjectivity and inefficiency; general VLMs lack ultrasound-specific knowledge and multi-task generalization.

Method: Develop EchoVLM with a Mixture of Experts architecture trained on ultrasound data spanning seven anatomical regions; enables tasks: ultrasound report generation, diagnosis, and visual question answering.

Result: On ultrasound report generation, EchoVLM improves BLEU-1 by 10.15 and ROUGE-1 by 4.77 points over Qwen2-VL; code and weights released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: EchoVLM demonstrates strong potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging and serves as a viable, multi-task, multi-region clinical tool for future ultrasound applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and
model weights are available at https://github.com/Asunatan/EchoVLM.

*Chuan Fang,Heng Li,Yixun Liang,Jia Zheng,Yongsen Mao,Yuan Liu,Rui Tang,Zihan Zhou,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialGen introduces a large synthetic dataset and a multi-view, multi-modal diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity, semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes across appearance, geometry, and semantics, with open-sourced data and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D indoor modeling is slow and labor-intensive, and existing generative methods struggle to balance visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A large, high-quality, task-specific dataset is a key bottleneck.

Method: SpatialGen is a multi-view multi-modal diffusion model. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (from a text prompt), it synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic segmentation map from arbitrary viewpoints while maintaining cross-modal spatial consistency. The approach is trained on a large synthetic dataset: 12,328 structured annotated scenes, 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic renderings.

Result: In experiments, SpatialGen consistently outperforms prior methods, delivering higher fidelity, better semantic consistency, and robust cross-view/ cross-modal performance.

Conclusion: The authors open-source their dataset and models, enabling broader research in indoor scene understanding and generation and accelerating progress in design, VR, and robotic applications.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

### [44] [PRISM: Product Retrieval In Shopping Carts using Hybrid Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14985)
*Arda Kabadayi,Senem Velipasalar,Jiajing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a three-stage hybrid retrieval framework for retail product search that combines vision-language pre-filtering, segmentation-based background removal, and pixel-level matching to achieve fast yet fine-grained retrieval, outperforming baselines by 4.21% top-1 accuracy on ABV while remaining real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retail product retrieval is harder than generic image retrieval due to high inter-brand visual similarity and viewpoint variation; global V-L models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) struggle with subtle local cues, while pixel-wise methods are too slow for practical use.

Method: 1) Use SigLIP to retrieve top-35 semantically similar products from a fixed gallery. 2) Apply YOLO-E segmentation to remove background clutter and focus on product. 3) Perform fine-grained pixel-level matching with LightGlue across the filtered candidates.

Result: PRISM achieves higher top-1 accuracy than state-of-the-art image retrieval methods by 4.21% on the ABV dataset and operates within real-time constraints suitable for practical retail deployments.

Conclusion: A hybrid, staged approach can combine the efficiency of vision-language retrieval with the precision of pixel-level matching to address subtle inter-class variations in retail product retrieval, enabling faster yet more accurate search.

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

challenges, the detection of wires stands out due to their slender profile,
which poses a unique and intricate problem. To address this issue, we present
an innovative solution in the form of a monocular end-to-end model for wire
segmentation and depth estimation. Our approach leverages a temporal
correlation layer trained on synthetic data, providing the model with the
ability to effectively tackle the complex joint task of wire detection and
depth estimation. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
existing competitive approaches in the joint task of wire detection and depth
estimation. Our results underscore the potential of our model to enhance the
safety and precision of autonomous drones, shedding light on its promising
applications in real-world scenarios.

*Vasiliki Ismiroglou,Malte Pedersen,Stefan H. Bengtson,Andreas Aakerberg,Thomas B. Moeslund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improved underwater image synthesis by adding forward scattering and nonuniform medium terms; introduces BUCKET real-turbidity dataset with reference images; shows qualitative gains at higher turbidity; 82.5% of survey participants preferred the approach; code/data available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current underwater image formation models and synthesis pipelines often neglect forward scattering and distance-dependent visibility loss in turbid environments, focusing mainly on color/degradation. This limits realism and usefulness for training and benchmarking in highly turbid scenes.

Method: Extend the underwater image formation model to include forward scattering and nonuniform medium effects. Collect BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity to capture real footage with corresponding reference images. Benchmark qualitatively against the reference model via user survey.

Result: Qualitative improvements over the reference model observed as turbidity increases. The approach received an 82.5% selection rate in survey participants. Data and code are available on the project page.

Conclusion: Incorporating forward scattering and medium nonuniformity yields more realistic underwater imagery under turbidity, supported by user preference and a real-turbidity dataset. This framework provides a stronger basis for training and evaluating underwater vision systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

### [47] [No Modality Left Behind: Adapting to Missing Modalities via Knowledge Distillation for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15017)
*Shenghao Zhu,Yifei Chen,Weihong Chen,Shuo Jiang,Guanyu Zhou,Yuanhan Wang,Feiwei Qin,Changmiao Wang,Qiyuan Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaMM is a three-module framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation under missing modalities, combining graph-guided adaptive refinement, bi-bottleneck distillation with global style matching and adversarial feature alignment, and a lesion-presence-guided reliability auxiliary task. It uses knowledge distillation and auxiliary priors to improve robustness, validated on BraTS 2018 and 2024 with strong results especially for single/weak modality inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical practice, missing MRI modalities impede the performance and generalizability of multi-modal segmentation methods. The work aims to build a robust, generalizable framework that maintains accuracy when inputs are incomplete by leveraging semantic associations, distillation of cross-modal knowledge, and lesion-type priors.

Method: AdaMM comprises three synergistic modules: (1) Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module that models semantic relationships between generalizable and modality-specific features to adapt to missing modalities; (2) Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module that transfers structural and textural knowledge from teacher to student through global style matching and adversarial feature alignment; (3) Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module that predicts prior probabilities of lesion types via an auxiliary classification task to suppress false positives under incomplete inputs. The approach is evaluated on BraTS 2018 and 2024, compares against six missing-modality strategy categories, and emphasizes knowledge distillation.

Result: AdaMM consistently outperforms existing missing-modality methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality scenarios. Systematic evaluations validate the superiority of knowledge distillation as a missing-modality strategy, and the paper provides practical guidance for method selection. Code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: AdaMM delivers robust multi-modal brain tumor segmentation under missing modalities, advancing both performance and practical guidance for handling incomplete inputs. It also contributes insights into the effectiveness of knowledge distillation strategies in this domain.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

*Chau Pham,Quan Dao,Mahesh Bhosale,Yunjie Tian,Dimitris Metaxas,David Doermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based image editing method uses reinforcement learning to autonomously select hyperparameters (inversion timesteps, attention edits) along denoising steps via an MDP and PPO, reducing search time and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter search in diffusion editing is expensive and requires brute-force tuning of interdependent parameters; there is a need for an automatic, efficient method that yields consistent editing performance and enables practical deployment.

Method: Frame the editing process as a sequential decision-making problem within the diffusion denoising steps. Define an MDP where states capture the current image, timestep, and hyperparameters; actions adjust hyperparameters in real time. Incorporate editing objectives into the reward function. Train a policy with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to dynamically adjust hyperparameters across steps.

Result: The method achieves significant reductions in search time and computational overhead compared with brute-force approaches, yielding time-efficient hyperparameter tuning while preserving effective editing performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based, dynamic hyperparameter optimization makes diffusion-based image editing more practical for real-world deployment, reducing computational costs and enabling on-the-fly adaptation during editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

TL;DR: RynnVLA-001 uses a two-stage ego-centric pretraining pipeline plus an ActionVAE to improve vision-language-action modeling for robotics, achieving superior finetuned performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge visual frame prediction and action prediction in robotics, address the high output-space and data inefficiency in VLA models by leveraging large-scale ego-centric video data and compact action representations.

Method: Stage 1: Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. Stage 2: Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling jointly predicts future keypoint trajectories to connect visual frames to actions. ActionVAE compresses action sequences into latent embeddings, reducing the VLA output space.

Result: Finetuned on robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines, indicating the pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage pretraining plus ActionVAE yields improved VLA performance in robotics, suggesting better initialization and a tighter coupling between perception and action prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic-only training with domain randomization can reach 0.910 mAP@50 on a real‑world test set for a single-object detector, but synthetic metrics poorly predict real performance; diversity and augmentation are critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection for a specific object; assess viability of synthetic data and domain randomization; identify factors (data augmentation, viewpoint diversity, backgrounds) that influence transfer.

Method: Train YOLOv11 models (including an l-size) on synthetic data with domain randomization; experiment with dataset composition, augmentation, and model scaling; evaluate via synthetic validation, qualitative inspection, and quantitative on manually labeled real-world set; final ranking by Kaggle mAP@50.

Result: Synthetic validation metrics remained high yet poorly predictive; increasing dataset diversity (viewpoints, backgrounds) and tuned augmentation improved transfer; best config YOLOv11l with expanded diverse dataset achieved mAP@50 0.910 on hidden test set.

Conclusion: Synthetic-only training shows promise for detection tasks but gaps in capturing real-world variability persist; key contributions include the importance of diversity and augmentation; future work would explore real data integration or domain adaptation to close remaining gap.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

*Haichao Zhang,Yi Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST) and extended OOSTraj for denoising and predicting trajectories of occluded objects from noisy sensor data, aided by a Vision-Positioning Denoising Module that uses camera calibration. Achieves state-of-the-art results on Vi-Fi and JRDB, outperforms Kalman-based baselines, and provides code and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sensing is often noisy and occluded, leading to missing or corrupted trajectory information for out-of-sight objects. This poses safety risks in autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. There is a need to denoise and predict visual trajectories of unseen agents using unsupervised methods that leverage camera calibration.

Method: Define OST and extend OOSTraj to include pedestrians and vehicles. Propose a Vision-Positioning Denoising Module that uses camera calibration to create a vision–positioning mapping and denoise noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Adapt recent trajectory prediction models for the task and benchmark against traditional denoising methods (e.g., Kalman filter). Evaluate on Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets; provide code and preprocessed data for replication.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction on Vi-Fi and JRDB, significantly surpassing previous baselines, including Kalman filtering. It is the first to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy trajectories of out-of-sight agents.

Conclusion: This work introduces OST and the Vision-Positioning Denoising Module as a first step toward reliable denoising and prediction of out-of-sight trajectories under noisy sensing. It broadens applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance, and offers benchmarks and open-source code to foster further research.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

*Jisoo Lee,Michael R. Harowicz,Yuwen Chen,Hanxue Gu,Isaac S. Alderete,Lin Li,Maciej A. Mazurowski,Matthew G. Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unet-R231 best among public DL lung segmentation models for transplant-eligible patients; all models worsen with disease severity; need fine-tuning for severe pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate publicly available DL lung segmentation models' performance in preoperative planning for lung transplantation across disease severities, pathology types, and sides, to identify limitations.

Method: Retrospective study of 32 chest CT patients (2017-2019) with 3,645 axial slices. Segmentation with Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Assess with volumetric similarity, Dice, Hausdorff, and four-point clinical acceptability. Statistical comparisons (p<0.05).

Result: Unet-R231 outperformed others across severity and pathology categories. All models showed performance decline from mild to moderate-severe, especially in volumetric similarity. No significant side or pathology-type differences. TotalSegmentator close second; performance declines in moderate-to-severe cases.

Conclusion: Unet-R231 provides the most accurate automated segmentation among evaluated models; performance declines in moderate-to-severe pathology; specialized fine-tuning needed for severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

### [53] [OmniSegmentor: A Flexible Multi-Modal Learning Framework for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15096)
*Bo-Wen Yin,Jiao-Long Cao,Xuying Zhang,Yuming Chen,Ming-Ming Cheng,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OmniSegmentor, a universal multi-modal pretraining framework, built on ImageNeXt with five modalities, yielding SOTA results on diverse multi-modal semantic segmentation benchmarks and showing strong generalization across arbitrary modality combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal segmentation benefits from multiple modalities but lacks a flexible pretrain-and-finetune pipeline that handles arbitrary modality combinations. A universal, scalable pretraining framework is needed to enhance perceptual capabilities across diverse scenarios.

Method: Introduce OmniSegmentor and ImageNeXt (ImageNet-based, five modalities). Develop an efficient pretraining procedure that enables encoding modality-specific information in a unified, flexible manner, producing a universal multi-modal pretraining framework.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-modal semantic segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER, SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

Conclusion: A universal pretraining framework can consistently amplify perceptual capabilities across various modalities and scenarios, regardless of the specific modality combination, enabling robust multi-modal segmentation.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

### [54] [RGB-Only Supervised Camera Parameter Optimization in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15123)
*Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a single-RGB-video supervised method for dynamic-scene camera parameter optimization that is more efficient and accurate than COLMAP, using three components: patch-wise tracking filters, outlier-aware joint optimization, and a two-stage optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COLMAP struggles with dynamic scenes due to long runtimes and reliance on GT motion masks; many priors (focal length, depth, poses) are not available in casually captured RGB videos. There is a need for an approach that can estimate camera parameters in dynamic scenes using only a single RGB video.

Method: 1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters to establish sparse hinge-like temporal relationships in the video. 2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization that down-weights moving outliers without motion priors. 3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy that trades Softplus limits against convex minima to enhance stability and speed.

Result: Experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel) show the method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and more accurately using only a single RGB video for supervision. Validation includes feeding estimates into a 4D reconstruction and rendering 2D RGB and depth maps, demonstrating qualitative and quantitative improvements.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that robust, efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes is feasible with only RGB video supervision, enabling accurate 3D reconstructions without GT priors or extensive runtime.

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

*Gengliang Li,Rongyu Chen,Bin Li,Linlin Yang,Guodong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEDFACT-R1 boosts factual accuracy of medical vision-language models via a two-stage framework combining pseudo-label SFT grounding and Group Relative Policy Optimization RL, achieving up to 22.5% absolute gains on three medical QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models struggle with factual consistency and reliable reasoning. The paper aims to improve trustworthy medical AI by grounding external knowledge and guiding reasoning.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning to incorporate external factual expertise; (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to promote self-consistent reasoning.

Result: Up to 22.5 percentage points absolute improvement in factual accuracy over prior SOTA across three public medical QA benchmarks. Ablation shows cold-start SFT is necessary and each GRPO reward contributes to performance.

Conclusion: Integrating knowledge grounding with RL-driven reasoning yields more trustworthy medical AI; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage
self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of
pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward,
underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning
for trustworthy medical AI. Codes are released at

### [56] [Leveraging Geometric Visual Illusions as Perceptual Inductive Biases for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15156)
*Haobo Yang,Minghao Guo,Dequan Yang,Wenyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using perceptual psychology's geometric visual illusions as auxiliary tasks in image-classification training improves generalization for CNNs and transformers, even with synthetic stimuli, by embedding perceptual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivates exploring whether perceptually grounded priors from classic visual illusions can guide deep networks to rely on more robust structural cues, countering reliance on superficial statistical regularities in large datasets.

Method: Create a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and train with three multi-source learning strategies that jointly optimize illusion recognition with ImageNet classification objectives.

Result: Adding illusion-based auxiliary supervision consistently enhances generalization, particularly for challenging visuals with complex contours and textures, and improves structural sensitivity in both CNNs and transformers.

Conclusion: Perceptually driven priors from synthetic geometric illusions can be effectively integrated into vision models, offering a new direction for incorporating perceptual science into deep learning for improved robustness.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

### [57] [AIP: Subverting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Adversarial Instructional Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15159)
*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIP reveals a stealthy attack vector in Retrieval-Augmented Generation by poisoning retrieval through adversarial instructional prompts; uses diverse query generation and a genetic algorithm to craft prompts that maximize attack success while retaining benign utility (ASR up to 95.23%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG relies on external retrieval and trusted, broadly shared instructional prompts. Traditional query-based attacks are often impractical due to fixed inputs, so adversaries can target the instructional prompts themselves to covertly degrade system integrity.

Method: Introduce Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) and a pipeline: (1) a diverse query generation strategy to simulate realistic paraphrase variation, (2) a genetic algorithm–based joint optimization to evolve prompts, balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness.

Result: Demonstrates attack success up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality; shows prompts generalize across paraphrases and remain effective across varied queries, exposing a vulnerability in shared instructional prompts within RAG systems.

Conclusion: Shared instructional prompts constitute a critical, previously overlooked attack surface in RAG. Findings argue for auditing and governance of prompts, plus defenses in the retrieval pipeline to mitigate adversarial instructional prompts and safeguard system integrity.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

### [58] [Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Segmentation from 2D Natural Images Pretrained Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15167)
*Pak-Hei Yeung,Jayroop Ramesh,Pengfei Lyu,Ana Namburete,Jagath Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose M&N, a model-agnostic semi-supervised framework that distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model into a 3D segmentation model via iterative co-training with cross-pseudo masks and learning-rate guided sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D medical segmentation benchmarks with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage abundant 2D pretrained models to improve data-scarce 3D medical image segmentation in semi-supervised settings, addressing noisy pseudo-labels and enabling architecture-agnostic transfer.

Method: Iterative co-training of a 2D pretrained model and a 3D model trained from scratch, exchanging pseudo-masks; learning-rate guided sampling to adapt the ratio of labeled/unlabeled data per batch based on predicted accuracy and stability; model-agnostic design.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets, outperforming 13 existing semi-supervised methods across settings; ablation confirms model-agnostic property and effectiveness.

Conclusion: M&N provides a robust, adaptable framework for cross-domain supervision transfer from 2D to 3D medical segmentation, compatible with diverse architectures; code is released.

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

*Ali Nazari,Bardiya Kariminia,Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-GAN: racially unbiased age transformation GAN for kinship verification; improves accuracy across ages, preserves identity, and outperforms SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the age gap in kinship verification and racial bias in aging models, which hinder verification when same-age parent-child photos are scarce.

Method: Proposes RA-GAN with two modules (RACEpSp and a feature mixer) to synthesize racially unbiased, same-age facial images for kin verification; evaluated on KinFaceW-I/II and compared to SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN; code released on GitHub.

Result: RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN by 13.14% on average across age groups and surpasses CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by 9.1% in racial accuracy; RA-GAN preserves identities better across age groups. Transforming parent/child images to the same age increases kinship verification accuracy: KinFaceW-I gains of +5.22 (father-son), +5.12 (father-daughter), +1.63 (mother-son), +0.41 (mother-daughter); KinFaceW-II gains of +2.9 (father-daughter), +0.39 (father-son), +1.6 (mother-son).

Conclusion: Age-normalized, racially unbiased face synthesis via RA-GAN improves kinship verification accuracy and resilience to racial bias; code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

### [60] [Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178)
*Zaiquan Yang,Yuhao Liu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot spatio-temporal video grounding framework using multimodal LLMs, introducing DSTH and TAS with a logit-guided re-attention module to improve spatial-temporal grounding; achieves state-of-the-art results on three STVG benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires locating a video tube that matches a text query. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) show two issues: they tend to use dynamic grounding tokens that may not fully leverage query cues (attributes/actions) and often underperform due to incomplete integration of the query cues, hindering accurate grounding. A zero-shot approach leveraging MLLMs with targeted prompting and attention mechanisms could address these limitations.

Method: Introduce decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) that decouples the query into attribute and action sub-queries to probe the target’s existence in space and time. Use a logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent spatial and temporal prompts by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query, guiding attention to reliable spatial and temporal cues. Apply temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) to combine predictions from original and temporally augmented frames to improve temporal consistency. Evaluate across multiple MLLMs and datasets.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three common STVG benchmarks.

Conclusion: A practical zero-shot STVG framework powered by MLLMs. DSTH and TAS effectively harness the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs for spatial and temporal grounding, with LRA providing reliable prompts to improve attention and temporal coherence. Code will be released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

### [61] [Maize Seedling Detection Dataset (MSDD): A Curated High-Resolution RGB Dataset for Seedling Maize Detection and Benchmarking with YOLOv9, YOLO11, YOLOv12 and Faster-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15181)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDD provides a high-quality aerial maize seedling dataset for stand counting with three classes (single, double, triple). Benchmarking shows singles are most tractable; multi-plant detection is challenged by rarity and irregularity. YOLOv11 is fastest while YOLOv9 achieves the best single-plant accuracy; overall results enable real-time, precision-agriculture applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate plant stand counting is essential for precision agriculture (early monitoring, yield prediction, resource management) but curated datasets are scarce and labor-heavy to produce. An annotated dataset enables robust, scalable computer-vision models for automation.

Method: MSDD collects diverse aerial images across growth stages (V4–V6) under nadir and varied conditions, labeled into three classes (single, double, triple plants). Benchmarking was performed using YOLO-based detectors, evaluating accuracy (precision/recall) and inference speed (35 ms per image plus 120 ms saving outputs). The study discusses class imbalance and its impact on multi-plant detection.

Result: Single-plant detection achieved up to 0.984 precision and up to 0.873 recall; detecting doubles/triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearances caused by planting errors. YOLO11 is the fastest model, while YOLOv9 provides the highest accuracy for single-plant detection. Overall, MSDD demonstrates robust, real-world applicability and provides a foundation for improving stand counting and resource optimization.

Conclusion: MSDD advances automated agricultural monitoring by offering a representative dataset for developing robust stand-counting models, enabling real-time decision-making and more efficient precision agriculture practices.

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on applying autoregressive image modeling with self-guided self-supervised objectives (ST-AR) to fix three semantic-learning hurdles, yielding notable FID improvements without pretrained representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve high-level visual semantics and image understanding in autoregressive visual models, addressing limitations like local/conditional dependence, inter-step inconsistency, and spatial invariance.

Method: Introduce self-supervised objectives during training to guide next-token prediction; propose ST-AR framework, train autoregressive models for images without relying on pretrained representations.

Result: Significant improvements in image generation and understanding; approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% for LlamaGen-XL, with the same sampling strategy.

Conclusion: ST-AR effectively enhances autoregressive models' image understanding and quality without external pretrained features, suggesting broader applicability in visual autoregressive tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncSeal is a watermarking framework that enables robust image synchronization under geometric transformations by adding embedder/extractor networks and a discriminator; it can upgrade existing watermarking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric transformations threaten watermark integrity; current watermarking methods lack robust synchronization; there is a need for an end-to-end solution that estimates and inverts geometry while preserving perceptual quality.

Method: Introduce SyncSeal: an embedder network imperceptibly modulates images and an extractor network predicts the geometric transformation parameters; both are trained end-to-end to minimize estimation error, with a discriminator to maintain perceptual quality; can be layered on top of existing watermarking methods.

Result: Experimental validation across a wide variety of geometric and value-metric transformations shows accurate synchronization and demonstrates that SyncSeal can upgrade existing watermarking methods to withstand transformations they were vulnerable to.

Conclusion: SyncSeal provides robust synchronization against geometric transformations and can enhance existing watermarking approaches without sacrificing perceptual quality, with applicability to diverse transformation types.

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

*Fangjinhua Wang,Qingshan Xu,Yew-Soon Ong,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a diffusion-based framework for depth refinement in multi-view stereo (MVS), using conditional diffusion guided by a dedicated encoder and a lightweight diffusion network (2D U-Net + ConvGRU) with a confidence-based sampling strategy; yields two methods, DiffMVS (efficient) and CasDiffMVS (state-of-the-art on several benchmarks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D reconstruction via MVS traditionally refines depth maps progressively but can be computationally expensive. Diffusion models offer strong generative refinement capabilities; integrating them into MVS could improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency, especially by leveraging conditional guidance and lightweight architectures.

Method: Formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Introduce a condition encoder to steer the diffusion denoising. Use a diffusion network that combines a lightweight 2D U-Net with convolutional GRU to capture spatial and short-term temporal refinement cues. Propose a confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the diffusion model's estimated confidence. Propose two variants: DiffMVS (emphasizing efficiency) and CasDiffMVS (achieving state-of-the-art performance). Code released at the provided repository.

Result: DiffMVS achieves competitive runtime and GPU memory efficiency compared to strong baselines. CasDiffMVS attains state-of-the-art performance on standard MVS benchmarks such as DTU, Tanks & Temples, and ETH3D.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based MVS framework is a promising direction for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction from calibrated images. The two proposed methods advance both efficiency (DiffMVS) and accuracy (CasDiffMVS) and open avenues for further improvements in diffusion-guided MVS.

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and
ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that
operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by
the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.
In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It
offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains,
built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts.
Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across
platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on
WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art
results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on
WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling
for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code
to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.

### [66] [Depth AnyEvent: A Cross-Modal Distillation Paradigm for Event-Based Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15224)
*Luca Bartolomei,Enrico Mannocci,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Stefano Mattoccia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-modal distillation from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) is used to generate dense depth proxy labels for monocular event-camera depth estimation, enabling competitive and state-of-the-art performance without dense ground-truth depth annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras lack large, densely labeled depth datasets. A robust, scalable supervision signal is needed to train monocular depth models on event data, especially in high-speed and challenging lighting conditions.

Method: Propose a cross-modal distillation pipeline that uses an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames to leverage VFMs for dense depth proxies. Two model variants are explored: (i) a vanilla VFM (e.g., Depth Anything v2) as a depth predictor, and (ii) a derived recurrent architecture that adapts VFMs for monocular event-to-depth inference. Evaluations are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without dense depth annotations and, for the VFM-based models, reaches state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Cross-modal distillation with VFMs enables dense depth estimation from monocular event cameras without expensive depth annotations, with practical setups requiring only aligned event and RGB streams and accessible foundation models, achieving strong empirical results.

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Silvio Mazzucco,Carl Persson,Mattia Segu,Pier Luigi Dovesi,Federico Tombari,Luc Van Gool,Matteo Poggi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose VocAlign, a source-free, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for vision-language models that uses a student–teacher setup with vocabulary alignment, parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA, and a Top-K class selection strategy to improve pseudo-labels and reduce memory, achieving a 6.11 mIoU gain on Cityscapes and strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable domain adaptation of vision-language models for open-vocabulary segmentation without access to source data, balancing performance with efficiency.

Method: A student–teacher framework augmented with a vocabulary alignment mechanism to inject additional class concepts into pseudo-labels; Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning; Top-K class selection in the student model to cut memory usage while boosting adaptation performance.

Result: Achieves a 6.11 mIoU improvement on the Cityscapes dataset and demonstrates superior zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in open-vocabulary segmentation.

Conclusion: VocAlign provides an effective, resource-efficient solution for source-free domain adaptation of vision–language models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, combining vocabulary-aware pseudo-labeling with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and memory-saving strategies.

Abstract: We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework
specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our
method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment
strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional
class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing
computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection
mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory
requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach
achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and
demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting
a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

*Abhishek Basu,Fahad Shamshad,Ashshak Sharifdeen,Karthik Nandakumar,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibPrompt tunes small prompts to calibrate medical vision-language models under scarce labeled data, using a regularizer that aligns smoothed accuracy with predicted confidence and an angular separation loss to improve textual feature reliability; yields better calibration across multiple models/datasets with minimal loss to clean accuracy; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confidence calibration in medical vision-language models is underexplored and crucial to avoid overconfident errors that can undermine clinical decision-making and trust.

Method: Optimize a small set of learnable prompts with two calibration objectives under scarce data: (1) a regularizer aligning smoothed accuracy with predicted confidences, and (2) an angular separation loss that increases textual feature proximity/divergence to improve the reliability of confidence estimates in multimodal Med-VLMs.

Result: CalibPrompt consistently improves model calibration across four Med-VLMs and five medical imaging datasets, with minimal impact on clean accuracy.

Conclusion: CalibPrompt effectively calibrates Med-VLMs during prompt tuning under limited data, enhancing trust-worthy predictions; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

### [69] [Discovering New Theorems via LLMs with In-Context Proof Learning in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14274)
*Kazumi Kasaura,Naoto Onda,Yuta Oriike,Masaya Taniguchi,Akiyoshi Sannai,Sho Sonoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An automated Conjecturing-Proving Loop generates and proves new theorems in Lean 4 by leveraging in-context learning with a growing proof context, capable of rediscovering known results and proving ones that require context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate moving from solving preset problems to discovering novel theorems and formalizing them, and test if LLMs can learn proof strategies through contextual information without parameter updates.

Method: A Conjecturing-Proving Loop that auto-generates conjectures, proves them in Lean 4, and iteratively uses previously generated theorems and proofs as context. No parameter changes to LLMs; relies on in-context learning and automatic verification; code available.

Result: The framework rediscovered theorems with formal verification that appeared in existing literature but were not yet formalized. It also shows that at least one theorem could not be proved by the LLM without in-context learning.

Conclusion: In-context learning within a looping conjecture-proof framework can enable discovery and formal proof of novel results, including proofs requiring contextual knowledge; the approach is reproducible and code is released.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

### [70] [A Neural Network for the Identical Kuramoto Equation: Architectural Considerations and Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14384)
*Nishantak Panigrahi,Mayank Patwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study of DNN solvers for a nonlocal Kuramoto-based conservation law; architecture and training choices significantly affect accuracy and efficiency; tanh is robust, sine occasionally better but risk artefacts; DNNs are competitive but exhibit oversmoothing of discontinuities; provides empirical guidelines and highlights fundamental limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill gap in understanding how DNN architectural choices affect accuracy and computation time when solving nonlocal conservation laws, and to benchmark against traditional solvers while identifying inherent limitations of standard feed-forward networks with discontinuities.

Method: Experiments across activation (tanh, sine, ReLU) with depths 4–8 layers, widths 64–256 neurons; training regimes with varying collocation points and epochs; measure energy-norm error and runtime; compare to conventional numerical methods; analyze tendency to oversmooth sharp features and artefacts.

Result: Tanh gives stable convergence across configurations; sine can yield marginally lower error and shorter training in isolated cases but may produce nonphysical artefacts; DNNs achieve competitive accuracy with different compute-time trade-offs; standard feed-forward nets struggle with singular/piecewise-constant solutions due to activation-induced smoothness; guidelines emerge but fundamental limitations persist.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidelines for DNN setup in scientific computing and highlights core limitations that must be addressed to extend applicability to discontinuous systems; underscores need for architectural or theoretical advances to handle sharp features.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

### [71] [Disproving the Feasibility of Learned Confidence Calibration Under Binary Supervision: An Information-Theoretic Impossibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14386)
*Arjun S. Nair,Kristina P. Sinaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Binary supervision cannot yield well-calibrated, diverse confidence estimates; it's an information-theoretic underspecification that makes learning distinguish confidence levels impossible; post-hoc calibration reshapes rather than teaches, while novel supervision paradigms are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable, calibrated confidence estimates are crucial for safe and trustworthy AI. The paper argues that under binary correct/incorrect supervision, networks face a fundamental information-theoretic constraint, explaining persistent miscalibration and hallucinations even with various training tricks.

Method: The authors present mathematical analysis showing an underspecified mapping under binary signals. They conduct extensive empirical evaluation across negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, measuring calibration (ECE) and confidence diversity (entropy/std).

Result: They identify universal failure patterns: negative rewards yield extreme underconfidence (ECE>0.8) and low diversity (std<0.05); symmetric losses fail to avoid averaging; post-hoc calibration achieves ECE<0.02 but by compressing the confidence distribution. The underlying problem is an underspecified mapping where binary supervision cannot distinguish different confidence levels. Real-world validation shows 100% failure rate for learning-based methods across the datasets; post-hoc calibration succeeds only 33% by transformation, not learning. This explains hallucinations and justifies the necessity of post-hoc calibration.

Conclusion: The impossibility is fundamental; an information-theoretic constraint implies that learning calibrated confidence with diversity from binary signals is unattainable without changing supervision. The authors propose new supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement and adaptive multi-agent learning to overcome these limitations without human confidence annotations.

Abstract: We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot
simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful
diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning
negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration
methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a
methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:
negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while
destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to
escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE
less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize
this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot
distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60
percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent
confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure
rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while
post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our
theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.
This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and
establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely
convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement
and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental
limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

### [72] [Robust Barycenters of Persistence Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14904)
*Keanu Sisouk,Eloi Tanguy,Julie Delon,Julien Tierny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust fixed-point method to compute Wasserstein barycenters of persistence diagrams for generic transport costs q>1 (including (1,2) robust to outliers), extending beyond the q=2 limitation and enabling robust clustering and dictionary encoding; provides open-source Python code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical barycenter computation via assignment arithmetic means paired with OT plans only yields results for q=2, making it fragile to outliers and restricting the cost function. There is a need for robust barycenters under generic OT costs (especially q in (1,2)) for persistence diagrams to improve reliability in downstream tasks.

Method: Adapt a fixed-point algorithm to compute a barycenter diagram under generic transportation costs (q>1), specifically enabling robustness to outliers (q in (1,2)). The approach is applied to persistence diagrams and used in two tasks—clustering in the PD space and dictionary encoding—demonstrating robustness and versatility. A Python implementation is provided.

Result: Demonstrates added robustness to outliers and applicability of the generalized framework in two scenarios: (i) clustering persistence diagrams on their metric space and (ii) dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. The authors also provide a Python implementation at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: The work extends robust Wasserstein barycenter computation to non-quadratic costs for persistence diagrams, broadening robustness to outliers and expanding practical use (clustering, dictionary coding). It provides an open-source tool for practitioners.

Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our
generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address:

### [73] [Q-ROAR: Outlier-Aware Rescaling for RoPE Position Interpolation in Quantized Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14391)
*Ye Qiao,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-ROAR stabilizes RoPE-based position interpolation with post-training quantization to enable longer context windows without retraining, using per-band frequency-grouping of RoPE dimensions and a small search over per-band W_Q and W_K scales; introduces two diagnostics and a symmetry option, achieving modest accuracy gains and perplexity reductions with no fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending LLM context windows is essential for long-range tasks. RoPE-based PI methods extend inputs without retraining, and PTQ enables deployment, but PI+PTQ together cause accuracy degradation due to long-context aliasing, dynamic range issues, axis anisotropy, and outlier shifts. A non-invasive stabilization is needed.

Method: Introduce two diagnostics—Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity) and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift across contexts). Propose Q-ROAR: group RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and perform a small search over per-band scales for W_Q and W_K (with an optional symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by a tiny long-context dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernels, or architecture changes.

Result: Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

Conclusion: Q-ROAR provides a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that enables long-context Pi+PTQ usage with minimal overhead and no retraining, via a diagnostics-guided per-band RoPE scaling search that is compatible with current inference stacks.

Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Lukas Rauch,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free hashing baseline (Hashing-Baseline) uses PCA, random orthogonal projections, and thresholding on frozen pretrained embeddings to produce compact binary codes, enabling competitive image and audio retrieval without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bypass expensive, scenario-specific training for hashing while leveraging rich representations from pretrained encoders, enabling scalable, plug-and-play retrieval across modalities.

Method: Apply classical hashing steps (PCA, random orthogonal projection, binarization) to frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders; no fine-tuning or learning.

Result: Achieves competitive retrieval performance on standard image retrieval benchmarks; demonstrates generality with a new audio hashing benchmark.

Conclusion: Training-free, encoder-agnostic hashing baselines can be strong baselines and reduce deployment complexity across modalities.

Abstract: Information retrieval with compact binary embeddings, also referred to as
hashing, is crucial for scalable fast search applications, yet state-of-the-art
hashing methods require expensive, scenario-specific training. In this work, we
introduce Hashing-Baseline, a strong training-free hashing method leveraging
powerful pretrained encoders that produce rich pretrained embeddings. We
revisit classical, training-free hashing techniques: principal component
analysis, random orthogonal projection, and threshold binarization, to produce
a strong baseline for hashing. Our approach combines these techniques with
frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders to yield
competitive retrieval performance without any additional learning or
fine-tuning. To demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach,
we evaluate it on standard image retrieval benchmarks as well as a newly
introduced benchmark for audio hashing.

### [75] [FedAVOT: Exact Distribution Alignment in Federated Learning via Masked Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14444)
*Herlock,Rahimi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAVOT uses masked optimal transport to align client availability with the FL objective, addressing participation bias and instability in FedAvg. It provides convergence guarantees and demonstrates strong empirical gains, even with very few clients per round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In FL, partial participation leads to a mismatch between the real-world availability distribution q and the optimization objective distribution p, causing biased and unstable updates with FedAvg. The work aims to realign these distributions during aggregation.

Method: Formulate aggregation as a masked optimal-transport problem between q and p and compute transport-based aggregation weights using Sinkhorn scaling; prove convergence guarantees; achieve an O(1/√T) convergence rate in a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent of the number of participating users per round.

Result: Practice shows drastically improved performance over FedAvg across heterogeneous, fairness-sensitive, and low-availability settings; effective even when only two clients participate per round.

Conclusion: FedAVOT provides a principled, scalable aggregation scheme that mitigates participation bias via optimal transport, with provable convergence and practical gains over standard FedAvg.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw
data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the
distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely
aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective
(\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates
under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal
Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal
transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling,
\textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable
convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent
of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm
drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous,
fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients
participate per round.

*Mahsa Khazaei,Azim Ahmadzadeh,Alexei Pevtsov,Luca Bertello,Alexander Pevtsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, explainable anomaly detector for H-alpha data from GONG that flags and explains anomalous observations using user-defined criteria, outperforming existing methods and releasing a 2,000-sample dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With an unprecedented data volume from space and ground observatories, ensuring data quality for ML models is critical. Black-box detectors are often inadequate for astronomical data; domain-expert explainability and user-defined criteria are valuable for reliable data curation.

Method: Introduce H-Alpha Anomalyzer, a non-ML anomaly-detection algorithm that uses user-defined criteria to identify anomalous observations. It highlights the exact regions triggering the anomaly and quantifies the anomaly likelihood. The authors also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations (1,000 anomalous, 1,000 non-anomalous) for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches and provides explainability, enabling qualitative evaluation by domain experts. The dataset is released to support benchmarking and reproducibility.

Conclusion: A lightweight, explainable anomaly-detection approach is effective for real-time quality control of space-based H-alpha data streams and can improve ML pipeline performance by ensuring higher-quality inputs and facilitating human-in-the-loop review.

Abstract: The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

TL;DR: Introduces randomized local coordination for distributed optimization with partially separable regularizers; reduces per-iteration communication (to 2 messages for pairwise terms) while preserving convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronization in distributed optimization is costly when many nodes coordinate on a sum of regularizers. By exploiting partial separability (each G_j depends only on a subset of nodes), communication can be reduced.

Method: Each node independently samples one regularizer G_j uniformly at random and coordinates only with nodes in S_j. Instead of using the proximal map of the full sum, the method uses the proximal map of a single randomly chosen G_j. For graph-guided regularizers with |S_j|=2, this yields exactly 2 messages per iteration. The analysis shows convergence and rates.

Result: The algorithm attains tilde O(ε^{-2}) iterations for convex objectives; under strong convexity, O(ε^{-1}) to an ε-solution and O(log(1/ε)) to a neighborhood. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate convergence and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: Randomized local coordination preserves convergence while eliminating global coordination, offering substantial communication savings without sacrificing convergence rates.

Abstract: Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full
synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise
regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per
iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node
independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes
sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer
$G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For
graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to
exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and
under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an
$\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a
neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the
proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves
convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both
convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world
datasets.

### [78] [BEACON: Behavioral Malware Classification with Large Language Model Embeddings and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14519)
*Wadduwage Shanika Perera,Haodi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEACON uses LLM-generated embeddings from raw sandbox behavior reports, followed by a 1D CNN, to perform multi-class malware classification, and it outperforms existing methods on the Avast-CTU CAPE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static analysis struggles against modern threats that use obfuscation, polymorphism, and evasion techniques; runtime behavioral signals provide more reliable, context-aware detection. The paper argues for dense semantic embeddings of behavioral reports via LLMs to improve malware classification.

Method: Generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior reports using a large language model, then classify with a one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN). The approach is evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public CAPE Dataset, comparing against baseline methods.

Result: BEACON consistently outperforms existing methods on the dataset, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the proposed architecture for robust malware classification.

Conclusion: LLM-derived embeddings of behavioral reports, when combined with a 1D-CNN classifier, offer a robust and effective approach to multi-class malware detection, with demonstrated superiority on the Avast-CTU CAPE dataset and potential for broader deployment.

Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

### [79] [Predicting Case Suffixes With Activity Start and End Times: A Sweep-Line Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14536)
*Muhammad Awais Ali,Marlon Dumas,Fredrik Milani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a sweep-line, multi-model technique to predict case suffixes with start and end timestamps for each activity, enabling resource-aware planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current case suffix predictions typically output a single end timestamp, which is insufficient for resource capacity planning. Waiting times depend on the workload of other ongoing cases, so there is a need to predict full activity timelines (start and end) and coordinate predictions across all cases.

Method: Predicts the suffixes for all ongoing cases in lockstep (sweep-line) rather than per-case in isolation. Outputs include both waiting and processing times for each activity. Employs a multi-model approach and evaluates on real-life and synthetic datasets, comparing instantiations to demonstrate advantages over single-model approaches.

Result: Experiments indicate that the multi-model sweep-line approach yields higher accuracy for case suffix predictions and more realistic resource utilization forecasts compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enables resource-aware predictive process monitoring by producing detailed activity timelines (start and end) for case suffixes and coordinating predictions across cases. A multi-model design is advantageous, with potential for improved capacity planning, though scalability and model selection are important considerations for future work.

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

### [80] [LiMuon: Light and Fast Muon Optimizer for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14562)
*Feihu Huang,Yuning Luo,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiMuon is a light, fast optimizer for training large models that combines momentum-based variance reduction with randomized SVD, achieving lower memory and sample complexity O(ε^{-3}) under smooth and generalized smooth conditions, with experiments on DistilGPT2 and ViT showing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Muon variants suffer from high memory or sample complexity when training large, matrix-structured models; a lighter optimizer is needed for practical large-scale AI tasks including LLMs.

Method: Proposes LiMuon leveraging momentum-based variance reduction and randomized SVD to exploit matrix-structured parameters, delivering reduced memory usage; provides theoretical guarantees of O(ε^{-3}) sample complexity under both smooth and generalized smooth conditions; supports large-scale non-convex stochastic optimization.

Result: Theoretical: shows O(ε^{-3}) sample complexity under smooth and generalized smooth conditions. Empirical: training DistilGPT2 and ViT demonstrates efficiency and practicality of LiMuon.

Conclusion: LiMuon achieves efficient, memory-light training for large models with robust convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness assumptions, making it suitable for modern AI tasks like LLMs and vision transformers.

Abstract: Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so
efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More
recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for
matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to
studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from
high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we
propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models,
which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory
than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has
a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the
smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer
mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial
intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy
this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition.
Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify
efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

*Shiyuan Luo,Runlong Yu,Chonghao Qiu,Rahul Ghosh,Robert Ladwig,Paul C. Hanson,Yiqun Xie,Xiaowei Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A2SL is a retrieval- and augmentation-based self-supervised framework that improves modeling under data scarcity and atypical conditions by learning scenario similarities and adaptively augmenting data, demonstrated on freshwater ecosystems with better accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental knowledge discovery relies on labeled, task-specific data which is costly to collect; models often fail to generalize in data-scarce or atypical conditions. The work aims to leverage cross-location/time data and targeted augmentation to enhance ecological modeling under these constraints.

Method: Introduce a scenario encoder trained with a multi-level pairwise learning loss to capture scenario similarities; a retrieval mechanism uses these similarities to augment the target with relevant data from other locations or times; an augmentation-adaptive module selectively enhances atypical/extreme scenarios via targeted data augmentation.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness in data-scarce and atypical settings, demonstrated on modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics in freshwater lakes.

Conclusion: A2SL provides a broadly applicable framework that can generalize to various scientific domains where data are sparse or atypical, extending beyond freshwater ecosystems.

Abstract: The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific
data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing
machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or
atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive
Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant
observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a
scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios.
These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a
target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods.
Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical
or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an
augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios
through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case
study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen
dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL
significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in
data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater
ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in
various scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Evidential PINN (E-PINN), an uncertainty-aware PINN that uses evidential deep learning to estimate predictive uncertainty and infer PDE parameters via a learned posterior; validated with 1D Poisson and 2D Fisher-KPP, showing better calibrated coverage than Bayesian PINN/Deep Ensembles and a glucose-insulin medical data case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for uncertainty quantification in PINNs and reliable parameter inference for PDEs; existing Bayesian PINN and deep ensembles have calibration issues; apply evidential learning to obtain calibrated predictive uncertainty and posterior parameter estimates.

Method: Combine PINN with evidential deep learning: use marginal distribution loss to quantify uncertainty and learn a posterior over PDE parameters; train on PDE residuals, data likelihood, and prior; evaluate via coverage probabilities; apply to two PDEs and a medical dataset.

Result: E-PINN achieved empirical coverage probabilities significantly better calibrated than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble baselines; demonstrated feasibility on medical glucose-insulin data.

Conclusion: E-PINN is a promising uncertainty-aware PINN framework that yields calibrated predictive uncertainty and tractable posterior parameter inference, with potential real-world impact in science and healthcare.

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying
Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of
uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of
evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers
unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating
our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a
Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated
empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than
Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world
applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze
clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on
diabetes pathophysiology.

### [83] [Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14577)
*Yang Xu,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structure-preserving margin distribution learning for high-order tensor data (SPMD-LRT) using low-rank tensor decompositions to avoid vectorization; demonstrates superior accuracy over SVM, vector-based LMDM, and prior tensor-based SVMs, with Tucker yielding best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMDM focuses on margin distribution but relies on vector inputs; vectorization of tensors destroys multi-mode structure and increases computation. There is a need for a method that preserves tensor structure while optimizing the entire margin distribution for high-dimensional data.

Method: Introduce SPMD-LRT that operates directly on tensors without vectorization. Incorporates first-order and second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective. Parameterizes the weight tensor via low-rank decompositions (rank-1 CP, higher-rank CP, and Tucker). Employs an alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) scheme to iteratively update factor matrices and the core tensor.

Result: Empirical results on MNIST, image datasets, and fMRI neuroimaging show that SPMD-LRT outperforms conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and existing tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker Machines). The Tucker-based SPMD-LRT achieves the highest accuracy among the variants.

Conclusion: The structure-preserving approach with margin-distribution optimization is effective and robust for high-dimensional tensor data; Tucker decomposition yields the best performance, highlighting the benefit of preserving multi-mode structure during learning.

Abstract: The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in
classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but
the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However,
existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with
high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the
data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In
this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for
High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates
directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT
preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and
second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,
and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),
higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An
alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core
tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information
of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved
classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,
images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior
classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and
prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker
Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest
accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling
high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

*Minh Vu,Konstantinos Slavakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse online policy-iteration using Hadamard-sparse GMM-Q functions (S-GMM-QFs) achieves competitive performance with far fewer parameters while enabling exploration from streaming data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create an interpretable, data-efficient online RL framework that matches dense Deep RL performance with significantly fewer parameters by combining sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions with online policy-iteration.

Method: Extend offline GMM-QFs to an online setting using streaming data; enforce sparsity via Hadamard overparametrization; exploit the Riemannian manifold structure of the parameter space to perform online gradient updates on a smooth objective.

Result: S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense Deep RL on standard benchmarks with substantially fewer parameters and maintain strong performance in low-parameter regimes where sparsified Deep RL methods struggle.

Conclusion: Sparse GMM-QFs offer a principled, interpretable, and parameter-efficient alternative to dense Deep RL in online settings, with competitive performance and better generalization under tight parameter budgets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration
framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of
sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work
that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme
that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is
regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which
mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of
S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing
for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth
objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense
deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer
parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes
where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

*Alexander Aghili,Andy Bruce,Daniel Sabo,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adds an energy-matching term to the loss in coarse-grained MD (CGSchNet) evaluated on Chignolin; results show no statistically significant accuracy improvement but reveal how energy constraints affect generalized free-energy surface learning; points to future work in energy estimation and multi-modal losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional force matching emphasizes matching forces/gradients, which can neglect absolute energy differences crucial for thermodynamic realism; incorporating an energy term may better capture the thermodynamics of coarse-grained models.

Method: Introduce an energy-matching term in the loss function and vary its weight; evaluate on Chignolin using the CGSchNet model; assess impact on accuracy and on the generalization of the free-energy surface.

Result: Energy matching did not yield statistically significant improvements in accuracy; however, it exposed distinct tendencies in how the model generalizes the free-energy surface, suggesting qualitative changes in thermodynamic landscape learning.

Conclusion: Energy estimation and multi-modal loss formulations hold promise for better coarse-grained modeling, motivating future work on improved energy estimation techniques and richer loss formulations that jointly optimize for gradients and energies.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into
biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required
to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a
promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching
approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a
model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy
conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy
matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the
Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight
of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically
significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how
models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future
opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy
estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

TL;DR: PM-SFL introduces Probabilistic Mask training to privacy-preserving Split Federated Learning, enabling structured randomness without explicit noise, with personalized masks and layer-wise knowledge compensation to handle data and system heterogeneity, achieving better privacy-utility balance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate data reconstruction risks in SFL from intermediate representations, address performance loss from noise-based defenses, and handle heterogeneity across clients and devices.

Method: Develop Probabilistic Mask training; personalize masks per client based on local data; implement layer-wise knowledge compensation to support adaptive model splitting; provide theoretical privacy analysis; validate on image and wireless sensing tasks.

Result: PM-SFL improves accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks; shows strong performance under data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity; scalable privacy-preserving SFL.

Conclusion: PM-SFL offers a scalable, privacy-protective SFL framework that preserves model utility without explicit noise, effectively handling heterogeneity and providing theoretical privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to
traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through
model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model
updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data
reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate
representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model
performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and
privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training
to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates
data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data
heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel
structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce
a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying
resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting.
Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image
and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves
accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with
particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable and efficient medical data classification in home/field settings where embedded devices are resource-constrained and GPUs are impractical.

Method: Encode inputs as high-dimensional hypervectors, build multiple cluster-specific prototypes (class-wise clustering), and classify via similarity search in hyperspace. Evaluated on three medical tasks, notably heart sound classification, with energy efficiency and robustness analyses.

Result: HD3C achieves ~350x energy efficiency over Bayesian ResNet on heart sound classification with less than 1% accuracy difference; shows strong robustness to noise, limited training data, and hardware errors, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Conclusion: Hyperdimensional computing with class-wise clustering offers a viable, reliable, and energy-efficient alternative for medical data classification on low-power hardware, suitable for real-world deployment; code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease
screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are
prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their
substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such
platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering
(HD3C), a lightweight classification framework designed for low-power
environments. HD3C encodes data into high-dimensional hypervectors, aggregates
them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification
through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical
classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more
energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference.
Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training
data, and hardware error, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical
results, highlighting its potential for reliable deployment in real-world
settings. Code is available at https://github.com/jianglanwei/HD3C.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUFG introduces a stable, progressive approach to machine unlearning by combining a forgetting-gradient-guided gradient corrector for fine-tuning-based unlearning with a curriculum that forgets from easy to hard. This method narrows the gap to retraining as a gold standard, improving stability and reliability, and is validated across multiple forgetting scenarios with public code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rising privacy and security concerns in AI, there is a need to erase specific knowledge from models. Existing unlearning methods often prioritize speed or aggressive forgetting, which destabilizes weights and reduces reliability. A stable, progressive unlearning framework is required.

Method: CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via Forgetting Gradients) adds a forgetting-gradient-guided gradient corrector for fine-tuning-based unlearning and adopts a curriculum-learning style that progressively forgets from easy to hard, aiming to improve stability and mimic retraining performance.

Result: Extensive experiments across various forgetting scenarios show that CUFG improves stability and effectiveness, bringing results closer to the gold-standard Retrain method and offering improved reliability over aggressive forgetting techniques; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Curriculum unlearning is a promising direction for the MU field. CUFG demonstrates that integrating forgetting-gradients and a curriculum can yield stable, progressive unlearning and paves the way for future research.

Abstract: As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the
ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing
attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and
aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular,
radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random
label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced
reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via
Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of
approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and
data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient
corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a
curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard.
These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by
enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both
effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of
curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers
forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive
experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and
effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) for time-series transformers uses Discrete Wavelet Transform to derive signal-aware positional embeddings, outperforming eight baselines across ten datasets with ~9.1% relative gains over sinusoidal position encoding in biomedical signals, with competitive efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional encodings in transformers are signal-agnostic; for time-series with non-stationary, multi-scale dynamics, a data-driven, signal-aware encoding is desirable.

Method: Compute positional embeddings from input time series via Discrete Wavelet Transform, integrating wavelet-derived features into embeddings; evaluate against eight existing PEs across ten time-series datasets; compare to sinusoidal absolute PE baseline.

Result: DyWPE consistently outperforms the eight baselines; average relative improvement ~9.1% over sinusoidal absolute PE in biomedical signals; retains competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Signal-aware, wavelet-based positional encoding effectively captures multi-scale dynamics in time-series transformers, offering clear performance gains while maintaining practicality.

Abstract: Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally
signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices
while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is
particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit
complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce
Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework
that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time
series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing
state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative
improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position
encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational
efficiency.

*Yuemin Wu,Zhongze Wu,Xiu Su,Feng Yang,Hongyan Xu,Xi Lin,Wenti Huang,Shan You,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeCoP is a dynamic, multi-scale dependency-aware pre-training framework for time-series that explicitly models evolving inter-patch interactions, improving generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal variability and distribution shifts in time-series data degrade generalization. Existing pre-training models struggle to capture the interplay of short- and long-term dependencies and spurious correlations across scales.

Method: At input, Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) mitigates shifts while preserving patch-specific traits. At latent level, Hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, aided by an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) that learns instance-discriminative, time-invariant representations.

Result: DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten datasets, notably improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 compared with PatchTST, while utilizing only 37% of the FLOPs.

Conclusion: Modeling dynamic, multi-scale dependencies with IPN, DCL, and ICM yields stronger generalization and efficiency, mitigating distribution shifts and spurious correlations in time-series pre-training.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for
representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency
Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies

### [91] [Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14678)
*Hyungjoon Soh,Junghyo Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes clocks-based attention that enforces continuity/monotonicity for continuous sequences, yielding a closed-form, Gaussian-like score via path-integral; enables nearly parameter-free, monotone attention for both parallel and autoregressive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity, which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets; there is a need for a built-in alignment model that is causal, smooth, and near-diagonal without external regularizers.

Method: Introduce learned nonnegative clocks for source and target; model attention as the meeting probability of clocks; derive a closed-form Gaussian-like scoring rule via path-integral; support two regimes: normalized clocks for parallel decoding with global length, and unnormalized clocks for autoregressive decoding; designed as nearly parameter-free, drop-in replacements.

Result: In a Transformer text-to-speech setup, the approach yields more stable alignments and robustness to global time-scaling, while achieving accuracy comparable to or better than scaled dot-product baselines.

Conclusion: The framework likely generalizes to other continuous targets (e.g., video, temporal signals) and offers a practical, low-parameter alignment mechanism that enforces continuity and monotonicity without external positional regularizers.

Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that
explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many
sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on
positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity,
which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative
\emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting
probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form,
Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth,
near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The
framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel
decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for
autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In
a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable
alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or
improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize
applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSCL introduces Reward-Based Dynamic Sampling and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum Learning to optimize RL-based tool learning. It prioritizes high-value data via reward statistics and focuses on undermastered sub-tasks, yielding a 3.29% BFCLv3 gain over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for LLM-based tool learning suffers from an abundance of low-value samples as training progresses, and existing dynamic sampling methods fail to account for the multi-task structure and fine-grained reward signals inherent to tool learning. A tailored approach is needed to improve data efficiency and learning progress.

Method: Two components: (1) Reward-Based Dynamic Sampling uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (means and variances across rewards) to rank and prioritize data with higher learning value; (2) Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum Learning adaptively concentrates training on less-mastered sub-tasks, addressing interdependencies among sub-tasks.

Result: DSCL significantly improves training efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, with a reported 3.29% improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark, supported by extensive experiments and ablations over key components.

Conclusion: DSCL provides a tailored solution for tool learning by leveraging complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics; it enhances data efficiency and performance in multi-task RL settings and can inform future curriculum and sampling strategies for RL with structured tasks.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

*Yeyu Yan,Shuai Zheng,Wenjun Hui,Xiangkai Zhu,Dong Chen,Zhenfeng Zhu,Yao Zhao,Kunlun He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PreGC is a task- and architecture-agnostic graph condensation framework that uses optimal transport and a generalized GC objective to produce reusable condensed graphs compatible with any GNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional graph condensation relies on rigid GNNs and task-specific supervision, limiting generalization across tasks and architectures. A universal GC objective grounded in GNN optimization consistency can unify existing methods and enable transferable condensed graphs.

Method: Derives a generalized GC optimization objective; introduces PreGC via optimal transport. Proposes a hybrid-interval graph diffusion augmentation to boost generalization by increasing node-state uncertainty; aligns the graph transport plan with the representation transport plan to preserve semantics across source and condensed graphs; adds a traceable semantic harmonizer to map source nodes to condensed nodes for downstream adaptation during pre-training.

Result: The framework demonstrates task-independence and seamless compatibility with arbitrary GNNs, with extensive experiments validating improvements in generalization and transferability across tasks and architectures.

Conclusion: PreGC transcends task- and architecture-specific limitations of traditional GC methods, offering a reusable, generalizable condensation paradigm that preserves semantics while enabling efficient downstream adaptation.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.

*Sosuke Hosokawa,Toshiharu Kawakami,Satoshi Kodera,Masamichi Ito,Norihiko Takeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transcoder is trained on the cell2sentence model to extract interpretable decision circuits from a state-of-the-art single-cell foundation model; these circuits align with known biology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability remains a key challenge for single-cell foundation models (scFMs). While they perform well on tasks like cell-type annotation and perturbation response prediction, their decision processes are less transparent than differential expression analyses. Transcoders from LLM research offer a potential route to extract human-interpretable circuits.

Method: Train a transcoder on the C2S scFM and use it to extract internal decision-making circuits. Assess whether these circuits correspond to real biological mechanisms.

Result: The extracted circuits correspond to real-world biological mechanisms, indicating that transcoders can uncover plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

Conclusion: Transcoding-based interpretability is feasible for scFMs and can reveal biologically plausible decision circuits, enhancing understanding and trust in these models.

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation
response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale
transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the
decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to
traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,
transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable
decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a
transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By
leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits
from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to
real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to
uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

### [95] [One-step Multi-view Clustering With Adaptive Low-rank Anchor-graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14724)
*Zhiyuan Xue,Ben Yang,Xuetao Zhang,Fei Wang,Zhiping Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OMCAL is a one-step multi-view clustering method that learns a low-rank adaptive consensus anchor graph (CAG) via nuclear-norm regularization and integrates category indicator learning, improving clustering accuracy and efficiency on both small and large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome information loss and noise when directly fusing multiple anchor graphs into a single CAG, and to avoid separate post-processing that hurts effectiveness and scalability.

Method: Introduce a nuclear-norm based adaptive CAG learning model to suppress redundancy and noise in anchor graphs, and integrate category indicator acquisition with CAG learning in a unified one-step optimization framework.

Result: Empirical results on ordinary and large-scale datasets show OMCAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: OMCAL provides a robust, scalable one-step solution for AGMC by combining adaptive low-rank CAG learning with integrated category indicator inference, achieving better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

### [96] [FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching and ODE Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14775)
*Shuangshuang He,Yuanting Zhang,Hongli Liang,Qingye Meng,Xingyuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowCast-ODE formulates hourly weather forecasting as a continuous-state flow, trained in a coarse-to-fine manner (6h pretraining, then hourly with an ODE solver), achieving better RMSE and energy conservation, with a ~15% smaller model via AdaLN-Zero and reduced assimilation-cycle temporal discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate hourly forecasts are essential for applications like weather prediction and planning, but current models struggle with rapid error accumulation in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities stemming from ERA5's 12-hour assimilation cycle.

Method: A conditional flow-path model learned from the previous state, using a coarse-to-fine strategy: 6-hour data with dynamic flow matching, then hourly refinement with an ODE solver. Introduces a lightweight AdaLN-Zero modulation to reduce model size by ~15% without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: FlowCast-ODE achieves lower RMSE, better energy conservation (less blurring, preserves fine-scale details) than strong baselines; comparable to state-of-the-art for extreme events such as typhoons; reduces temporal discontinuities at assimilation-cycle transitions.

Conclusion: Continuous-flow dynamics with coarse-to-fine training offer accurate, temporally coherent hourly forecasts with efficient computation, demonstrating practical advantages for operational weather prediction.

Abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour
intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a
critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors
in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's
12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a
framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow.
FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state,
an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and
enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train
the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly
data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to
achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank
AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%
without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE
outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and
better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more
fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.
Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with
assimilation cycle transitions.

### [97] [Pre-training under infinite compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14786)
*Konwoo Kim,Suhas Kotha,Percy Liang,Tatsunori Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-efficient pre-training under fixed data and unlimited compute: tune regularization (weight decay ~30x standard), scale parameters and epochs, and use ensembling to reach a better asymptotic loss. Distilling the ensemble into a smaller student preserves much of the gain. Downstream benefits include improved pre-training evals and data efficiency in continued pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compute grows faster than web text for LM pre-training, so the study investigates how to pre-train effectively when data is the bottleneck but compute is not constrained, challenging traditional data-constrained recipes that overfit.

Method: Systematically vary regularization (notably weight decay ~30x standard), epochs, and parameter counts; employ ensemble methods over independently trained models; analyze scaling laws to extrapolate asymptotic performance; distill ensemble into a smaller student; validate on downstream benchmarks and continued pre-training data.

Result: Regularization and scaling improve data efficiency; the asymptote of loss is lower with ensembles than regularized single models; best protocol requires only 200M tokens data with 5.17x less data than baseline; data-efficiency gains persist at higher budgets; distillation yields an 8x smaller student retaining 83% of ensemble gains; downstream benchmarks show 9% improvement for pre-training evals and 17.5x data-efficiency over continued pre-training on math data.

Conclusion: Simple algorithmic interventions—regularization tuning, parameter scaling, targeted epoching, and ensembling (with distillation)—can unlock substantial data efficiency in a compute-rich future and transfer benefits to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model
pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and
no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches
of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we
significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization,
finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard
practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a
simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance
via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed
compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models
achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our
best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and
ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less
data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement
persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be
realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a
student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling
benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to
downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and
a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math
mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can
enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTI identification is central and challenging; sequence-based methods scale well but may miss structural context. Incorporating structural priors aims to improve accuracy and interpretability without sacrificing throughput.

Method: A sequence-based framework that embeds structural priors into protein representations, employing learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment; uses structure-aware embeddings with attention over ligand–residue contacts, and includes ablation studies and embedding visualizations to validate robustness and interpretability.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Human and BioSNAP datasets; competitive on BindingDB; superior AUROC and BEDROC on LIT-PCBA in virtual screening; ablations confirm the importance of learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment; embeddings reveal better pocket correspondence and interpretable ligand–residue attention.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers scalable, structure-aware DTI predictions with strong performance gains and interpretable representations, supporting its use in high-throughput screening and structure-guided drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while
maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

*Julian F. Schumann,Anna Mészáros,Jens Kober,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STEP introduces a unified benchmarking framework for trajectory prediction to standardize evaluation across datasets, support heterogeneous scenarios and joint models, and test robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, moving beyond leaderboards to deeper insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory-prediction benchmarks lack standardized evaluation across diverse datasets, heterogeneous traffic scenarios, joint modeling capabilities, and good user documentation, hindering fair comparisons and generalization analysis.

Method: STEP provides a unified interface for multiple datasets, enforces consistent training/evaluation conditions, and supports a wide range of prediction models. The authors validate STEP through experiments that (i) reveal limitations of common testing procedures, (ii) highlight the benefits of joint modeling of agents for better interaction predictions, and (iii) show vulnerability of SOTA models to distribution shifts and adversarial agents.

Result: STEP demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of unified evaluation, exposing testing procedure limitations, the value of joint modeling for interaction-aware predictions, and the susceptibility of state-of-the-art models to distribution shifts and targeted attacks, thereby enabling deeper analysis beyond leaderboard metrics.

Conclusion: STEP shifts the focus from leaderboard-centric evaluation to gaining deeper insights into model behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent trajectory prediction scenarios, facilitating more robust and interpretable assessments.

Abstract: While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and
effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for
evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and
evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We
demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)
the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint
modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the
vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution
shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift
the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model
behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

*Andrea Cavallo,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jointly learn the network and the precision (inverse covariance) matrix in Precision Neural Networks (PNNs) using alternating optimization, capturing sparsity and independence while preserving spectral structure; the approach provides theoretical error bounds and outperforms two-step methods on both synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariance-based neural networks (VNNs) suffer from dense covariance matrices, lack of conditional independence encoding, and task-agnostic precomputation, which can limit performance and interpretability. The precision matrix (inverse covariance) naturally encodes independence, is often sparse, and retains spectral properties, motivating a joint, task-aware estimation of network parameters and precision.

Method: Formulate an optimization that jointly learns network weights and the precision matrix, solved via alternating optimization: iteratively update network parameters with a fixed precision, then update the precision estimate with fixed network parameters. The authors derive theoretical bounds on the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each iteration.

Result: Empirically, joint estimation of the network and precision matrix yields better performance than two-step baselines, demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Jointly estimating the network and the precision matrix enables PNNs to exploit independence and sparsity while preserving covariance structure, with theoretical guarantees on estimation error, making precision-based learning a viable alternative to covariance-based approaches.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph
determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and
stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically
dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a
task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations,
we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix
-- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical
independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral
structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an
optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the
precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially
updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound
the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each
iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to
two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a diffusion-based framework for constructing multivariate scenario trees for stochastic forecasting to improve decision-making under uncertainty, especially in energy markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-making under uncertainty requires the full distribution of future scenarios. Existing methods struggle to balance accuracy, non-anticipativity, and computational efficiency in multivariate forecasting for domains like energy markets and finance.

Method: DST recursively samples future trajectories using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models and clusters them into a tree structure, enforcing non-anticipativity at each stage so decisions depend only on observed history.

Result: In the NY state day-ahead electricity market, DST-based trees, when used with the same optimization algorithms, outperform scenario trees from conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines; stochastic optimization with DST yields more efficient decision policies than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same forecaster.

Conclusion: DST provides a general framework to improve stochastic forecasting and decision-making under uncertainty, achieving better performance in energy arbitrage and likely other multivariate forecasting/optimization tasks by better capturing and leveraging uncertainty.

Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce dependence on costly high-fidelity simulators and address offline RL data limitations by efficiently combining offline data with multiple simulators of varying fidelity and cost within a fixed budget.

Method: Introduce MF-HRL-IGM, a multi-fidelity hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that selects simulator fidelity by information gain maximization using a bootstrapping approach; provides theoretical no-regret guarantees.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes no-regret property; empirical experiments demonstrate superior performance compared with existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-fidelity hybrid RL with information-gain-based fidelity selection is effective for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget, offering theoretical guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

*Zhengwei Wang,Gang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2LFormer introduces a global-to-local attention scheme for graph transformers, using shallow layers for global attention and deeper layers with GNNs for local structure, plus cross-layer fusion, achieving strong performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Transformers risk diluting local neighborhood information when integrating global attention; there is a need to preserve local structure while leveraging global dependencies.

Method: Propose G2LFormer with a global-to-local attention pipeline: early layers apply attention to capture global information; later layers employ graph neural networks to learn local structure; a cross-layer fusion mechanism preserves valuable information across layers to mitigate information loss, maintaining scalable (linear) complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on node-level and graph-level tasks shows competitive or superior performance to existing linear GTs and GNNs, with linear scalability.

Conclusion: Global-to-local attention effectively balances global dependencies and local structure, enabling scalable, high-performance graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

Method: Conducted ablation studies with: 1) Temporal-Only model (two identical temporal pyramids), 2) Frequency-Only model (two spectral pyramids), and 3) w/o Cross-Fusion (replace cross-attention with a simpler fusion).

Result: The full DPANet consistently outperforms all ablated variants. The Temporal-Only and Frequency-Only models underperform significantly, confirming that fusing heterogeneous temporal and frequency information is critical. Removing cross-attention (w/o Cross-Fusion) causes the most severe performance degradation, indicating the interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

Conclusion: Interactive fusion via cross-attention between temporal and spectral features is essential for DPANet’s performance; multi-domain fusion yields superior results compared to single-domain designs.

Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

### [105] [Learning Graph from Smooth Signals under Partial Observation: A Robustness Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14887)
*Hoang-Son Nguyen,Hoi-To Wai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vanilla graph topology learning is implicitly robust to hidden nodes under partial, low-pass observations; by extending RIP to the Dirichlet energy, smoothness-based methods (GL-SigRep) can recover the observed-subgraph topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden nodes with unobserved signals can corrupt graph inference. Understanding whether standard, naive graph learning approaches remain reliable without explicitly modeling hidden nodes is important for practical applications.

Method: Extend the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy used in graph learning; analyze smoothness-based formulations (e.g., GL-SigRep) under partial observations and establish recovery guarantees for the observed nodes; validate with experiments.

Result: Theoretical results show implicit robustness of vanilla topology learning to hidden nodes under partial observations; synthetic and real-data experiments corroborate that the ground-truth topology of the observed nodes can be recovered.

Conclusion: Vanilla graph-learning methods can be robust to hidden nodes when signals are partially observed and low-pass, supported by RIP-like analysis of the Dirichlet energy; this endorses the use of simple smoothness-based approaches in partially observed settings.

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

*Guillermo Hijano Mendizabal,Davide Lancierini,Alex Marshall,Andrea Mauri,Patrick Haworth Owen,Mitesh Patel,Konstantinos Petridis,Shah Rukh Qasim,Nicola Serra,William Sutcliffe,Hanae Tilquin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement-learning framework (with GA and transformers) to systematically identify backgrounds in beauty-hadron decays; adaptable to other particle-physics measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backgrounds from many decay channels create significant challenges; need systematic method beyond intuition; computational limits restrict thorough background study.

Method: RL to identify critical backgrounds; integrate GA to explore sparse-reward trajectories; transformer-based agent to handle decay token sequences; aims to guide training and discovery of trajectories that yield correct backgrounds.

Result: No empirical results reported; study presents conceptual framework and algorithmic strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-GA-transformer approach offers a generalizable method for background identification and can reduce reliance on expert intuition; applicable to other measurements; requires future validation and experiments.

Abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) for reinforcement learning to improve interpretability in low-dimensional problems, achieving competitive performance on mobile-network resource allocation while providing robust local and global explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL with DNNs is powerful but opaque; interpretability and trustworthiness are critical, especially in safety- or resource-sensitive domains. The work aims to enhance transparency without sacrificing predictive accuracy by using SENNs.

Method: Integrates Self-Explaining Neural Networks with explanation extraction methods in a reinforcement learning setting focused on low-dimensional problems; targets generating robust local and global explanations of the model's behavior and tests on a mobile network resource allocation task.

Result: SENNs yield interpretable solutions with competitive performance, matching state-of-the-art methods while providing robust explanations.

Conclusion: SENNs show potential to improve transparency and trust in AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional RL tasks and can deliver strong accuracy alongside robust explanations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks
(DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic
hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical
domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction
methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our
approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and
global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method
on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs
can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work
highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in
AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong
performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing
robust explanations.

### [108] [DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14933)
*Xiangfei Qiu,Yuhan Zhu,Zhengyu Li,Hanyin Cheng,Xingjian Wu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a DAG-based framework (DAG) for TSF-X that uses dual causal networks along temporal and channel dimensions to leverage future exogenous variables and their causal relations with endogenous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSF-X methods neglect future exogenous variables and fail to capture causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables, limiting forecasting accuracy.

Method: Introduce Temporal Causal Module (causal discovery of how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables, then injection into forecasting of future endogenous from historical endogenous) and Channel Causal Module (discovery of how historical exogenous affects historical endogenous, then injection to improve prediction of future endogenous from future exogenous), both operating along temporal and channel dimensions to enable causal-informed forecasting.

Result: The abstract outlines the framework but does not report empirical results or performance metrics.

Conclusion: A dual causal framework (DAG) is proposed to enhance TSF-X by leveraging future exogenous variables and explicit causal relationships across time and channels.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

*Rohan Veit,Michael Lones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Encoder-based bot detectors outperform decoder-based detectors in accuracy and robustness; decoder-based detectors offer greater adaptability via task-specific alignment, enabling broader generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media manipulation through bots is a risk to online discourse; evaluating encoder versus decoder transformer architectures for bot detection informs the design of robust detection systems.

Method: Develop pipelines to evaluate bot-detection classifiers based on encoder and decoder transformer architectures, comparing performance, robustness, and adaptability across tasks.

Result: Encoder-based classifiers show greater accuracy and robustness; decoder-based models display greater adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting stronger potential for generalization across use cases; trade-offs between accuracy and adaptability observed.

Conclusion: Findings advance defense against manipulation in digital environments and aid in selecting architecture suited to deployment needs to protect the integrity of online discussion.

Abstract: Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder
transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments
being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

### [110] [Hierarchical Federated Learning for Social Network with Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14938)
*Zeyu Chen,Wen Chen,Jun Li,Qingqing Wu,Ming Ding,Xuefeng Han,Xiumei Deng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical federated learning on social networks with mobility (HFL-SNM) that jointly optimizes resource allocation and client scheduling to minimize energy, introducing Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate; proposes DO-SNM algorithm; shows gains in model performance and energy savings over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning protects data privacy but often ignores client mobility and resource constraints. Incorporating mobility and data sharing patterns into FL can improve model performance and efficiency, especially under limited resources.

Method: Formulate a hierarchical FL framework (HFL-SNM) on social networks with mobility. Define Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate. Cast a joint optimization problem for resource allocation and client scheduling under limited resources. Decouple the problem into sub-problems and develop Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with Mobility (DO-SNM) to solve them.

Result: Preliminary experiments indicate that effective and redundant data coverage influence model performance. DO-SNM achieves superior model performance and significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Mobility-aware hierarchical FL on social networks with optimized resource allocation can enhance both learning performance and energy efficiency. The EDCR/RDCR metrics and the DO-SNM algorithm offer a practical approach to balancing data usefulness and device constraints in FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows
collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting
data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically
preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,
whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on
the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data
sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of
limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource
allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy
consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce
the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.
We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model
performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization
problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary
experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with
Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing
energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ensemble machine learning predicts pregnancy-related nutritional status in Ethiopia with high accuracy, using EDHS data; Random Forest performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malnutrition among pregnant women in Ethiopia contributes to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Traditional statistical methods struggle to capture the complex, multidimensional determinants of nutritional status; a predictive model could aid early detection and targeted interventions.

Method: Data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020) with 18,108 records and 30 socio-demographic/health attributes. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalization, and SMOTE-based balancing. Feature selection identified key predictors. Evaluated supervised ensemble models: XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost.

Result: Random Forest achieved the best performance: four-class classification (normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, overnutrition) with 97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86% ROC AUC.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning effectively captures hidden patterns in complex health datasets, enabling data-driven strategies for early detection of nutritional risks and informing healthcare policy and practice in Ethiopia.

Abstract: Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in
Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and
multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a
predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data
from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108
records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing
included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,
followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised
ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost
were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest
model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories
(normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with
97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86%
ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in
capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for
early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications
for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven
strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

### [112] [Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14952)
*Zhuanghua Liu,Luo Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel algorithm (N^2SBA) for smooth bilevel problems with a strongly convex lower level under heavy-tailed noise, yielding epsilon-stationary points with explicit SFO complexities; specialized to nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax with improved rates; matches bounded-variance results when p=2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization under stochastic, heavy-tailed noise is common in ML (e.g., large language models, RL). Need algorithms with provable convergence to epsilon-stationary points and favorable stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity bounds that tolerate only a finite p-th moment.

Method: Introduce N^2SBA, a nested-loop algorithm with normalization to control gradient variance under heavy-tailed noise (order-p moment). Analyze convergence to an epsilon-stationary point in the stochastic setting and derive SFO complexity bounds depending on condition number kappa, noise level sigma, moment p in (1,2], and target accuracy epsilon. Specialize the framework to nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems, obtaining improved SFO rates.

Result: For smooth bilevel problems with a strongly convex lower-level, the SFO complexity to obtain an epsilon-stationary point is tilde O(kappa^{(7p-3)/(p-1)} sigma^{p/(p-1)} epsilon^{-(4p-2)/(p-1)}). For nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax, the complexity is tilde O(kappa^{(2p-1)/(p-1)} sigma^{p/(p-1)} epsilon^{-(3p-2)/(p-1)}). All bounds recover the best-known results in the bounded-variance case (p=2).

Conclusion: The N^2SBA framework achieves favorable SFO complexities under heavy-tailed noise and reduces to optimal results in the bounded-variance setting; it extends to minimax problems and provides a robust approach for practical machine learning scenarios involving bilevel and minimax structures.

Abstract: This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level
problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex.
We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased
stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in
many machine learning applications such as training large language models and
reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel
approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number,
$p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the
noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the
nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an
$\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known
results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAWN uses a transformer-based multi-encoder fusion-attention network to merge Wi-Fi and 5G signals for passive ISAC indoor scene inference, achieving sub-meter errors (~<0.6 m) with ~84% success, without interfering with communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable sensing without dedicated hardware by reusing existing wireless signals, and to overcome single-technology limitations by fusing multiple tech (Wi-Fi and 5G) to expand coverage and improve accuracy.

Method: Proposes FAWN, a MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network based on Transformer architecture to fuse Wi-Fi and 5G features for ISAC passive sensing; built a real prototype and tested in an indoor scenario.

Result: Empirical results show positioning errors below 0.6 m in about 84% of trials; demonstration of feasibility with real-world prototype.

Conclusion: Shows that multi-technology ISAC passive sensing with a transformer fusion network is feasible for indoor scene inference and can broaden sensing coverage without affecting current communications; suggests further improvements and broader technology integration.

Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.

TL;DR: A stochastic adaptive step-size strategy for convex optimization uses a first-order oracle to adapt step sizes without hyperparameter tuning, extending a parameter-free adaptive gradient method to the stochastic setting; it proves convergence and shows competitive empirical performance against tuned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate hyperparameter tuning in stochastic convex optimization by exploiting local geometry with only a first-order stochastic oracle, making the method practical and robust.

Method: Develops a stochastic version of Adaptive Gradient Descent Without Descent (AGDWD) that adaptively adjusts the step size based on local geometry inferred from stochastic gradients, without requiring hand-tuned parameters; provides theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions.

Result: Proves convergence of stochastic gradient descent with the proposed adaptive step-size under various assumptions and demonstrates empirical competitiveness against tuned baselines.

Conclusion: A geometry-aware, parameter-free adaptive step-size method for stochastic convex optimization that combines theoretical guarantees with strong empirical performance, reducing the need for hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We introduce a new adaptive step-size strategy for convex optimization with
stochastic gradient that exploits the local geometry of the objective function
only by means of a first-order stochastic oracle and without any
hyper-parameter tuning. The method comes from a theoretically-grounded
adaptation of the Adaptive Gradient Descent Without Descent method to the
stochastic setting. We prove the convergence of stochastic gradient descent
with our step-size under various assumptions, and we show that it empirically
competes against tuned baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGCN proposes embedding attention into graph structure for unsupervised graph clustering, addressing GNN and Transformer weaknesses, with a KV cache and a pairwise margin contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and resolve the complementary weaknesses of GNNs (over-smoothing via neighborhood aggregation) and Transformers (over-globalization) in unsupervised graph clustering; explore whether attention is inherently redundant for this task.

Method: Introduce Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) that reinterprets the graph as attention, embedding attention mechanisms directly into the graph structure. Adds a KV cache for efficiency and a pairwise margin contrastive loss to sharpen the attention space. Includes theoretical analysis contrasting AGCN with GNNs and Transformers.

Result: Empirical results show AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph clustering. The study also provides theoretical insights into how AGCN differs from GNNs and Transformers and demonstrates complementary weaknesses between the two.

Conclusion: AGCN offers a principled way to fuse global attention with local topology in graph clustering, challenging the notion that attention is redundant for unsupervised graph learning. The approach improves efficiency and discriminative capacity of the attention space.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage post-training for robotics using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Improvement. SFT combines behavioral cloning with steps-to-go prediction; Self-Improvement extracts a reward function and success detector to enable autonomous practice with minimal supervision. The approach yields superior sample efficiency and enables autonomous acquisition of novel, generalizable skills beyond imitation data, leveraging Embodied Foundation Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models pretrained on web-scale data offer opportunities for robotics but low-level control remains dominated by imitation. The work draws inspiration from the RL fine-tuning stage in LLMs to create an automated, data-efficient learning loop that can practice and improve beyond provided demonstrations.

Method: Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on pretrained foundation models using both behavior cloning data and steps-to-go predictions. Stage 2: Self-Improvement where steps-to-go predictions yield a reward function and a robust success detector, enabling robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robots compare sample efficiency and performance.

Result: The combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is more sample-efficient than simply scaling imitation data for supervised learning and achieves higher task success rates. Web-scale pretraining plus Self-Improvement ablations indicate this pairing is crucial for sample efficiency. It uniquely enables autonomous practice and acquisition of novel skills that generalize beyond the training demos.

Conclusion: Pairing pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement unlocks autonomous skill acquisition in robotics, with strong implications for Embodied Foundation Models. The approach demonstrates transformative potential by reducing supervision and expanding generalization, as supported by both real and simulated experiments.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a metric to isolate environmental shifts from policy updates in non-stationary RL (DoE) and an adaptive experience replay (DEER) that prioritizes transitions using environment-change detection, improving sample efficiency; reported 11.54% gain over state-of-the-art ER on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary environments cause dynamic changes in both environment and optimal policy. Traditional ER methods, especially TD-error prioritization, conflate policy and environment changes, hindering learning. A metric that isolates environment shifts can improve prioritization and learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce DoE (Discrepancy of Environment Dynamics) to isolate environment-shift effects on value functions. Build DEER (Discrepancy of Environment Prioritized Experience Replay) that uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies different prioritization strategies before and after each shift.

Result: DEER yields improved sample efficiency for off-policy methods, achieving a 11.54% improvement over the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods across four non-stationary benchmarks.

Conclusion: Separating environment dynamics from policy updates via DoE and adapting replay prioritzation with DEER enhances learning robustness and efficiency in non-stationary reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

*Juwon Kim,Hyunwook Lee,Hyotaek Jeon,Seungmin Jin,Sungahn Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for interpretable directional forecasting in finance: SIMPC unsupervised pattern extraction plus JISC-Net shapelet-based classifier for short-term forecasts, achieving strong performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in directional forecasting by combining unsupervised pattern discovery with an interpretable forecasting model.

Method: Stage 1 SIMPC segments/clusters multivariate time series revealing recurrent patterns invariant to amplitude and temporal distortions across varying window sizes. Stage 2 JISC-Net uses the early portion of these patterns as input to a shapelet-based classifier to forecast subsequent partial sequences for short-term direction.

Result: On Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities, the approach ranks first or second in 11 of 12 metric-dataset combinations, outperforms baselines consistently.

Conclusion: The framework enables transparent decision-making by exposing the pattern structures driving predictions, bridging the gap between deep learning performance and interpretable forecasting.

Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

### [119] [Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033)
*Padmaksha Roy,Almuatazbellah Boker,Lamine Mili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multivariate anomaly detection approach that models time-varying nonlinear spatio-temporal correlations by decoupling marginals, dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies, using a transformer for temporal patterns and a copula with a multivariate likelihood for spatial dependencies, trained with self-supervised contrastive learning to separate normal and anomaly samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world multivariate time series exhibit inter-variable dependencies that are not well captured by assuming conditional independence. The paper argues that joint dependencies and collective behavior are key indicators of anomalies, necessitating models that capture time-varying nonlinear spatio-temporal correlations.

Method: Use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns. For spatial dependencies, model inter-variable relationships via a multivariate likelihood and a copula in latent space, effectively decoupling marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies. Train temporal and spatial components jointly in latent space using a self-supervised contrastive objective to learn representations that separate normal from anomaly samples.

Result: Abstract does not report empirical results or datasets; the contribution is methodological with a proposed framework rather than presentation of experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework aims to improve multivariate AD by explicitly modeling joint spatio-temporal dependencies in a latent space and leveraging self-supervised contrastive learning to enable effective anomaly discrimination.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by
modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations}
found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components
are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate
normal and anomaly samples.

*Thomas Ackermann,Moritz Spang,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid offline imitation learning + online reinforcement learning with a multi-head network improves stability and win rate in a 2D shooter, outperforming pure RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency in complex multi-agent game environments; pure DRL (e.g., DQN) can be unstable and forget good policies; demonstrate a robust training paradigm using demonstrations.

Method: A multi-head neural network with shared feature extraction and attention mechanisms. One head performs behavioral cloning (supervised imitation) and another performs Q-learning. Training starts with behavioral cloning on demonstrations from rule-based agents, then transitions to online RL, enabling knowledge transfer via shared representations.

Result: The hybrid approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents, with reduced variance and higher stability compared to pure RL, indicating effective transfer between learning modes.

Conclusion: Combining demonstration-based initialization with reinforcement learning optimization yields a robust solution for game AI in complex multi-agent environments where pure exploration is insufficient.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

Conclusion: Hybrid sampling is effective for credit card fraud detection on imbalanced data and provides robust, improved performance across multiple classifiers.

Abstract: Credit card fraud remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance and
fraudsters mimicking legitimate behavior. This study evaluates five machine
learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a real-world dataset using
undersampling, SMOTE, and a hybrid approach. Our models are evaluated on the

show that the hybrid method achieves the best balance between recall and
precision, especially improving MLP and KNN performance.

*Quincy Hershey,Randy Paffenroth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse RNN with configurable intra-matrix sparsity, introduces a new metric called hidden proportion, and demonstrates performance gains with potential for meta-learning and data-driven optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and performance of sparse RNNs by controlling sparsity and by introducing a metric that explains performance variations, enabling data-driven meta-learning and optimization.

Method: Introduce alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparsity within trainable weight matrices of RNNs; define a novel metric 'hidden proportion' to capture the distribution of unknowns; combine the varied-sparsity architecture with the hidden-proportion metric to achieve performance gains and to set a priori performance expectations; discuss implications for generalized meta-learning and dataset-characteristic optimization.

Result: Significant performance gains observed; the hidden-proportion metric provides explanatory power for model performance; the approach yields improved a priori performance expectations and supports generalized meta-learning and optimization guided by intrinsic dataset characteristics (input/output dimensions).

Conclusion: The combined varied-sparsity RNN architecture and hidden-proportion metric offer a viable path toward data-driven meta-learning and model optimization that adapts to intrinsic properties of the data.

Abstract: This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying
sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns
within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model
performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and
model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set,
including input and output dimensions.

### [123] [Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15058)
*Federico Alvetreti,Jary Pomponi,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Simone Scardapane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention-based Double Compression (ADC) reduces communication in split learning for Vision Transformers by merging similar activations and pruning tokens, yielding lower forward-pass bandwidth and naturally compressed gradients while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split learning with Vision Transformers incurs large communication overhead due to transmitting intermediate activations. There is a need for methods that cut bandwidth without sacrificing performance.

Method: ADC uses two parallel compression strategies: (1) merge activations of similar samples using the average attention scores from the last client layer (class-agnostic, allowing merges across classes); (2) prune the least meaningful tokens after merging. This reduces forward-pass data and results in compressed gradients, enabling training without extra gradient tuning.

Result: Simulation results show ADC significantly reduces communication overhead compared with state-of-the-art SL frameworks while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: ADC provides a communication-efficient split-learning framework for Vision Transformers by combining sample-activation merging and token pruning, achieving bandwidth reduction without harming model performance and without requiring gradient approximation tweaks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

### [124] [Probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15060)
*Lukas Silvester Barth,Paulo von Petersenn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a smooth probabilistic surrogate for l0-regularized regression enabling exact gradients and faster convergence than Monte Carlo methods; outperforms IHT and Relaxed-Lasso; extends to nonlinear compressive sensing, showing global optimum recovers up to symmetries but exact recovery is not possible; reveals a rebound phenomenon; provides a canonical symmetry-handling algorithm and open-source implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aims to overcome Monte Carlo sampling bottlenecks and variance in sparse regression, achieving fast convergence to high-quality solutions; and to deepen understanding of nonlinear compressive sensing by characterizing parameter recovery limits under symmetry.

Method: Develops a smooth probabilistic reformulation of l0 regularization that yields exact gradients without Monte Carlo sampling. Demonstrates a fast optimization method with CPU/GPU efficiency and an open-source implementation. For nonlinear compressive sensing, builds on Fefferman and Markel to analyze recovery in the infinite-data limit and introduces a normal-form algorithm to pick canonical representatives within symmetry classes.

Result: The linear method achieves drastic convergence speedups over MC-based approaches and outperforms compressive sensing baselines (IHT, Relaxed-Lasso) across varied settings and SNRs. The nonlinear analysis shows global optimum enforces recovery up to certain symmetries, but exact parameter recovery is not achievable; a rebound effect is observed where teacher and student converge yet diverge despite decreasing test loss.

Conclusion: The work delivers a practical, faster alternative for sparse recovery with strong empirical gains and opens questions about fundamental limits in nonlinear compressive sensing, including symmetry-induced ambiguities and recovery impossibility, along with symmetry-aware algorithms.

Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized
regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the
computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima
of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves
convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing
algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and
signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and
GPUs and is freely available at
https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive
sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network
is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of
Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the
infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical
validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical
representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help
to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even
possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound
effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but
subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings
indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive
sensing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowRL shifts from maximizing scalar rewards to matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing, promoting diverse reasoning in LLM RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reward-maximizing methods like PPO/GRPO over-optimize dominant rewards, reducing exploration of valid but less frequent reasoning paths; need for diverse, robust reasoning trajectories.

Method: Convert scalar rewards into a learnable target distribution using a partition function; minimize reverse KL divergence between policy and target; implement as a flow-balanced optimization to encourage diverse exploration.

Result: On math benchmarks, FlowRL improves by 10.0% over GRPO and 5.1% over PPO; performs consistently better on code reasoning; demonstrates improved exploration and diversity.

Conclusion: Reward distribution matching via flow balancing is a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM RL, with better generalization across reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

### [126] [Improving Internet Traffic Matrix Prediction via Time Series Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15072)
*Martha Cash,Alexander Wyglinski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Clustering traffic matrix flows by their temporal patterns before deep learning prediction markedly improves forecast accuracy and routing performance, using two strategies (source clustering and histogram clustering).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic matrices contain flows with diverse temporal dynamics; a single global model struggles to fit all flows, limiting prediction accuracy and network optimization.

Method: Two clustering approaches—source clustering and histogram clustering—group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to training DL predictors. Models are trained on homogeneous subsets, then predictions are aggregated. Evaluated against global models and existing TM predictors on Abilene and GEANT.

Result: Significant RMSE reductions (up to 92% on Abilene, 75% on GEANT) compared with existing TM prediction methods. In routing scenarios, clustered predictions reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18% and 21%, respectively.

Conclusion: Clustering-based pre-processing of TM flows yields more accurate predictions and tangible routing benefits, highlighting the practical value of flow-wise temporal clustering for DL-based TM forecasting.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,
respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are
used for network optimization.

### [127] [Constrained Feedback Learning for Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15073)
*Shaoang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prior-free algorithm for non-stationary bandits with constrained feedback achieving near-optimal dynamic regret under a budget of queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments often provide reward feedback only intermittently; existing non-stationary MAB methods assume full feedback and/or require prior knowledge of non-stationarity. This work aims to handle constrained feedback without such priors.

Method: Introduce a novel prior-free algorithm for constrained-feedback non-stationary multi-armed bandits and derive its dynamic regret bound under a query budget B. The analysis yields a tilde-O bound that scales with K, V_T, T and B without relying on known non-stationarity levels.

Result: The algorithm achieves a dynamic regret of tilde{O}(K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T / B^{1/3}), matching the claimed near-optimal rate in the constrained-feedback setting without prior knowledge of V_T.

Conclusion: First-principled prior-free solution for constrained feedback in non-stationary MABs, delivering near-optimal dynamic regret and informative guidance for settings with limited reward queries.

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing
environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in
reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However,
existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every
round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback
is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a
new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where
the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first
prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of
the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in
this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$
is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

TL;DR: AI-driven pipeline predicts ambient air pollution from sky images and generates visualizations of pollution scenarios, enabling transparent, decision-ready representations and edge-friendly deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional air-quality monitoring has limited spatial coverage and accessibility. There's a need for interpretable, real-time forecasts and engaging visuals to improve public awareness, trust, and policy-relevant decision-making.

Method: Combine statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification; use vision-language model–guided image generation to produce semantically consistent visuals of air quality conditions; validated on urban sky image datasets; emphasizes user-centered UX; discusses green CNNs and FPGA-based incremental learning for edge real-time inference.

Result: Shows effectiveness in estimating pollution levels and producing coherent, interpretable visuals; validates the approach on an urban sky-image dataset; outlines components for user-facing interfaces to enhance situational awareness and engagement.

Conclusion: The approach yields interpretable pollution forecasts and visuals that support informed decisions; scalable to real-time, energy-efficient edge deployment with future work on FPGA-enabled incremental learning and broader adoption.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

*Lei Wang,Jieming Bian,Letian Zhang,Jie Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLEASE adaptively allocates multiple LoRA experts across federated learning clients and lets each client select a subset using a top-M mixture-of-experts, addressing heterogeneity in domain data while keeping communication efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific LLM fine-tuning requires data from multiple organizations with privacy constraints. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving learning but is hampered by computational and data heterogeneity. LoRA offers parameter-efficient fine-tuning, yet a single module struggles with diverse domains. FedLEASE tackles adaptive expert allocation and per-client expert selection to improve performance under heterogeneity.

Method: FedLEASE clusters clients by representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts. It introduces an adaptive top-M Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows each client to select the optimal number of experts to utilize during local fine-tuning in a federated setting.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets show that FedLEASE significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

Conclusion: FedLEASE effectively handles heterogeneity in federated LoRA fine-tuning by adaptive expert allocation and per-client expert selection, improving performance without increasing communication overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often
requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across
multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to
LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with
heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical
challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and
allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling
clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data
characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation
and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on
representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.
It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows
each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE
significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in
heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

*Natalie Collina,Surbhi Goel,Aaron Roth,Emily Ryu,Mirah Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Even with multiple misaligned AIs, if the user's utility lies in the convex hull of agents' utilities and there is model diversity, competitive interaction can approximate fully aligned outcomes; shown via multi-leader Stackelberg framework and Bayesian persuasion, with three guarantees and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address whether perfect alignment is necessary to gain alignment-like benefits; explore whether diversity and strategic interaction can compensate for misalignment.

Method: Model human-AI interaction as a multi-leader Stackelberg game; extend Bayesian persuasion to multi-round conversations among differently informed agents; analyze under three regimes: perfect alignment, approximate utility learning with quantal response, and best-single-AI selection; complement with two experimental sets.

Result: (1) With convex-hull condition, Bayes-optimal action learnable in all equilibria if it would be learnable under perfect alignment. (2) With approximate learning and non-strategic user via quantal response, near-optimal utility in all equilibria. (3) If user picks best AI after evaluation, equilibrium guarantees stay near-optimal without extra distributional assumptions.

Conclusion: Diversity and strategic competition among misaligned AIs can mimic fully aligned outcomes under broad conditions; this provides theoretical guarantees and empirical support for reliance on competitive multimodal systems as a practical path to alignment.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but
does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the
benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user
interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are
individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies
approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that
becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition
can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We
model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to
multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three
results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her
Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex
hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility
learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal
utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI
after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without
further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid FP-based hierarchical framework for energy-efficient training of large models; two-tier architecture with FPGA-based equation solving for lower layers and incremental learning for upper layers, plus Compound LLM framework distributing modules across levels to enable energy-aware, real-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Escalating computational and energy demands of large-scale deep learning (foundation models, LLMs) and sustainability concerns; gradient-based training is inefficient at scale.

Method: Divide the network into two tiers: lower layers optimized via single-step equation solving on FPGAs for efficient, parallelizable feature extraction; higher layers use adaptive incremental learning for continual updates. Introduce Compound LLM framework with LLM modules across hierarchy levels: lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning with low energy overhead; upper-level LLM performs adaptive decision-making with energy-aware updates.

Result: Theoretical analysis and architectural insights indicate substantial computational cost reductions while preserving high model performance; design is suitable for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Integrated design enhances scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with sustainable AI; energy-aware updates and modular LLM deployment enable efficient operation on energy-constrained platforms.

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep learning, particularly in
large-scale architectures such as foundation models and large language models
(LLMs), pose significant challenges to sustainability. Traditional
gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative
updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based
direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural
network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step
equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,
while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual
updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both
hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning
with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive
decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances
scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of
sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate
that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high
model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time
adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

### [132] [Super-Linear: A Lightweight Pretrained Mixture of Linear Experts for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15105)
*Liran Nochumsohn,Raz Marshanski,Hedi Zisling,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Super-Linear is a lightweight MoE model for general time-series forecasting that uses frequency-specialized linear experts trained on data resampled across multiple frequency regimes, with a spectral gating mechanism to dynamically select relevant experts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting requires generalization across diverse datasets while remaining computationally efficient. Large pre-trained models offer strong zero-shot performance but are expensive, motivating a lightweight alternative that generalizes well.

Method: Replace deep architectures with simple, frequency-specialized linear experts trained on resampled data spanning multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, forming a mixture-of-experts for forecasting.

Result: Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while delivering superior efficiency, robustness to varying sampling rates, and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that a simple, scalable MoE with frequency-aware linear experts and spectral gating can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy with lower computational cost and enhanced interpretability; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is critical in domains like energy, finance,
healthcare, and logistics, requiring models that generalize across diverse
datasets. Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong
zero-shot (ZS) performance but suffer from high computational costs. In this
work, We introduce Super-Linear, a lightweight and scalable mixture-of-experts
(MoE) model for general forecasting. It replaces deep architectures with simple
frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple
frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects
relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its
simplicity, Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while offering
superior efficiency, robustness to various sampling rates, and enhanced
interpretability. The implementation of Super-Linear is available at

### [133] [Limitations of Public Chest Radiography Datasets for Artificial Intelligence: Label Quality, Domain Shift, Bias and Evaluation Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15107)
*Amy Rafferty,Rishi Ramaesh,Ajitha Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Public chest X-ray benchmarks rely on noisy labels from radiology reports; they suffer from label errors, domain shift, and dataset bias, which degrade external performance. Clinician-validated labels and fair evaluation are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why current chest X-ray benchmarks underperform in real-world settings: automated label extraction errors, uncertainty/negation handling, radiologist disagreement, domain shift across datasets, and population biases that limit generalisability; and to call for better validation and fairer evaluation.

Method: Systematic analysis of label quality, dataset bias, and domain shift. Cross-dataset domain shift evaluation across multiple model architectures. Train a source-classification model to distinguish datasets (to assess bias). Subgroup analyses by age and sex. Expert radiologist review comparing dataset labels with ground-truth.

Result: Significant external performance degradation under cross-dataset evaluation (lower AUPRC and F1 than internal tests). Dataset bias detected as a near-perfect dataset-identification accuracy by a source-classifier. Subgroup analyses show reduced performance for minority age/sex groups. Radiologists identified substantial disagreement with public dataset labels.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks have clinical weaknesses; there is a need for clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks to improve generalisability and trust in AI chest X-ray models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown significant promise in chest radiography,
where deep learning models can approach radiologist-level diagnostic
performance. Progress has been accelerated by large public datasets such as
MIMIC-CXR, ChestX-ray14, PadChest, and CheXpert, which provide hundreds of
thousands of labelled images with pathology annotations. However, these
datasets also present important limitations. Automated label extraction from
radiology reports introduces errors, particularly in handling uncertainty and
negation, and radiologist review frequently disagrees with assigned labels. In
addition, domain shift and population bias restrict model generalisability,
while evaluation practices often overlook clinically meaningful measures. We
conduct a systematic analysis of these challenges, focusing on label quality,
dataset bias, and domain shift. Our cross-dataset domain shift evaluation
across multiple model architectures revealed substantial external performance
degradation, with pronounced reductions in AUPRC and F1 scores relative to
internal testing. To assess dataset bias, we trained a source-classification
model that distinguished datasets with near-perfect accuracy, and performed
subgroup analyses showing reduced performance for minority age and sex groups.
Finally, expert review by two board-certified radiologists identified
significant disagreement with public dataset labels. Our findings highlight
important clinical weaknesses of current benchmarks and emphasise the need for
clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks.

### [134] [TDRM: Smooth Reward Models with Temporal Difference for LLM RL and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15110)
*Dan Zhang,Min Cai,Jonathan Li,Ziniu Hu,Yisong Yue,Yuxiao Dong,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TD regularization for reward models (TDRM) smooths temporal differences to stabilize RL training, improve long-term alignment, and boost data efficiency; it complements verifiable rewards and is released with code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often exhibit temporal inconsistency, causing unstable policy updates and poor long-horizon alignment; smoothing TD signals can improve stability, learning efficiency, and reliability in RL with language models and verifiable reward methods.

Method: Introduce temporal-difference regularization during reward-model training to minimize TD error; integrate into an actor-critic online RL loop; can be used alongside verifiable reward methods in series; evaluated on Best-of-N and tree-search settings, and with RLVR.

Result: TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) yield performance gains (up to 6.6% in Best-of-N and 23.7% in tree-search); when combined with RLVR, data efficiency improves dramatically (achieving baseline-level performance with 2.5k data versus 50.1k); higher-quality policies observed across 8 model variants (5 series). Code released at the authors' GitHub.

Conclusion: TD training of PRMs provides smoother rewards and better alignment with long-term objectives, enhancing stability and data efficiency in RL with language models; it complements verifiable reward methods and is broadly applicable.

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants
(5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414,
Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B). We release
all code at https://github.com/THUDM/TDRM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid digital-physical deep learning framework enabling end-to-end training of non-differentiable physical layers via zeroth-order optimization and low-rank surrogates, achieving near-digital accuracy across vision, audio, and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome non-differentiability and limited expressiveness of physical components (e.g., photonic devices) and enable trainable hybrid architectures.

Method: Stochastic zeroth-order optimization to update physical layer parameters; a dynamic low-rank surrogate model to enable gradient propagation; implicit projector-splitting integrator to update the surrogate with minimal hardware queries after each forward pass.

Result: Near-digital baseline accuracy across modalities; effective end-to-end training of hybrids with various non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring resonators, Mach-Zehnder interferometers). Demonstrated across computer vision, audio classification, and language modeling.

Conclusion: Bridges hardware-aware deep learning and gradient-free optimization, offering a practical pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable, end-to-end trainable AI systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for energy-efficient, high-performance AI systems has led
to increased attention on alternative computing platforms (e.g., photonic,
neuromorphic) due to their potential to accelerate learning and inference.
However, integrating such physical components into deep learning pipelines
remains challenging, as physical devices often offer limited expressiveness,
and their non-differentiable nature renders on-device backpropagation difficult
or infeasible. This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that
combine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which
effectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the
end-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates
stochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal
parameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient
propagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the
implicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the
lightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware
queries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our
method across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio
classification, and language modeling. Notably, across all modalities, the
proposed approach achieves near-digital baseline accuracy and consistently
enables effective end-to-end training of hybrid models incorporating various
non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring
resonators, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers). This work bridges hardware-aware
deep learning and gradient-free optimization, thereby offering a practical
pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable,
end-to-end trainable AI systems.

### [136] [Efficient Conformal Prediction for Regression Models under Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15120)
*Yahav Cohen,Jacob Goldberger,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Estimates noise-free conformal prediction thresholds for regression with noisy calibration labels; develops a practical algorithm for continuous targets; validates on medical-imaging datasets with Gaussian label noise; achieves near clean-label performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes settings like medical imaging, regression predictions need reliable confidence intervals. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers calibrated intervals using a labeled calibration set, but label noise in the calibration data corrupts interval validity. The work aims to render CP robust to noisy labels and to recover near-ideal coverage.

Method: First derives a mathematically grounded procedure to estimate the noise-free CP threshold in the presence of label noise. Then converts this theory into a practical algorithm that handles the continuous nature of regression, addressing challenges such as defining nonparametric thresholds and avoiding overfitting.

Result: On two medical-imaging regression datasets with Gaussian label noise, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing alternatives, achieving performance close to the setting with clean (noise-free) labels.

Conclusion: The proposed CP-with-noise-robust threshold estimation effectively mitigates label noise in regression CP, enabling reliable prediction intervals in noisy calibration scenarios and narrowing the gap to ideal, clean-label performance.

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios, such as medical imaging applications, it is
critical to equip the predictions of a regression model with reliable
confidence intervals. Recently, Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a
powerful statistical framework that, based on a labeled calibration set,
generates intervals that include the true labels with a pre-specified
probability. In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for
regression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by
establishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free
CP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the
challenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem. We
evaluate the proposed method on two medical imaging regression datasets with
Gaussian label noise. Our method significantly outperforms the existing
alternative, achieving performance close to the clean-label setting.

*Lorne Applebaum,Travis Dick,Claudio Gentile,Haim Kaplan,Tomer Koren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel low-variance de-biasing method for learning from label proportions (LLP); flexible across loss functions; improves sample complexity; validated on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online advertising problems motivate LLP; need to infer individual labels from bag-level average labels in a partially supervised setting.

Method: Develops a low-variance de-biasing estimator that leverages aggregate label information; compatible with a broad range of losses in binary and multi-class classification; combines with standard techniques to improve sample complexity.

Result: Substantial improvements in sample complexity guarantees for many losses; empirical benchmarks show compelling performance gains over standard baselines.

Conclusion: The approach advances LLP by delivering a versatile, efficient learning-from-aggregate-labels framework with strong empirical support.

Abstract: Motivated by problems in online advertising, we address the task of Learning
from Label Proportions (LLP). In this partially-supervised setting, training
data consists of groups of examples, termed bags, for which we only observe the
average label value. The main goal, however, remains the design of a predictor
for the labels of individual examples. We introduce a novel and versatile
low-variance de-biasing methodology to learn from aggregate label information,
significantly advancing the state of the art in LLP. Our approach exhibits
remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of
practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class
classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard
techniques, we substantially improve sample complexity guarantees for a large
class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the
efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets,
demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.

*Viktor Kovalchuk,Nikita Kotelevskii,Maxim Panov,Samuel Horváth,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Logit-based federated learning with three aggregation methods reduces communication and improves robustness to non-IID data, achieving accuracy close to centralized training on MNIST/CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for large models is costly when sharing weights/gradients; logit-based FL exchanges only public-proxy logits to cut communication, but heterogeneity across client data complicates aggregation.

Method: Study and compare three logit-aggregation strategies—simple averaging, uncertainty-weighted averaging, and a learned meta-aggregator—and evaluate their performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to assess communication efficiency and robustness under non-IID data.

Result: All three methods reduce communication overhead and improve robustness under non-IID data, achieving accuracy competitive with centralized training; the learned meta-aggregator may offer the best performance.

Conclusion: Logit aggregation can effectively mitigate client heterogeneity in logit-based FL, with a learned meta-aggregator showing strong potential for practical large-model FL using a public proxy dataset.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) usually shares model weights or gradients, which is
costly for large models. Logit-based FL reduces this cost by sharing only
logits computed on a public proxy dataset. However, aggregating information
from heterogeneous clients is still challenging. This paper studies this
problem, introduces and compares three logit aggregation methods: simple
averaging, uncertainty-weighted averaging, and a learned meta-aggregator.
Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, these methods reduce communication overhead,
improve robustness under non-IID data, and achieve accuracy competitive with
centralized training.

### [139] [Mind the Gap: Data Rewriting for Stable Off-Policy Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15157)
*Shiwan Zhao,Xuyang Zhao,Jiaming Zhou,Aobo Kong,Qicheng Li,Yong Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proactively rewrite SFT data to align with the target policy, by keeping correct solutions on-policy and re-solving incorrect ones, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy fine-tuning, yielding strong gains over vanilla SFT and DFT on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT of LLMs is effectively off-policy; expert demonstrations come from a fixed behavior policy, causing distribution mismatch with the target policy. Importance sampling variance grows with policy gap, leading to training instability. Existing KL-based penalties are passive constraints; a more active approach is needed to shrink the gap.

Method: A data rewriting framework that proactively reduces the policy gap before optimization: preserve correct solutions as on-policy data and rewrite incorrect ones via guided re-solving, with expert demonstrations as a fallback when needed. This aligns the training distribution with the target policy prior to optimization, thereby reducing IS variance and stabilizing off-policy fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent and significant gains over vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT). The authors also plan to release code and data.

Conclusion: Proactive data rewriting effectively reduces distribution mismatch in SFT, stabilizes training, and improves performance, offering a simple yet effective alternative to KL penalties or clipping for off-policy fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

*Giorgos Armeniakos,Alexis Maras,Sotirios Xydis,Dimitrios Soudris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaRVIn: a cross-layer hardware–software co-design enabling energy-efficient mixed-precision DNN inference on RISC-V, combining ISA extensions, configurable ALU precision, multi-pumping, soft SIMD, pruning-aware fine-tuning, and greedy search for Pareto-optimal models, with cycle-accurate emulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedded microprocessors lack adequate ISA and hardware support for mixed-precision neural networks, causing inefficiencies like data packing/unpacking and underutilized arithmetic units; need an integrated solution to boost speed and energy efficiency.

Method: Introduce ISA extensions and a micro-architecture for mixed-precision 2/4/8-bit arithmetic; hardware enhancements include multi-pumping and soft SIMD for 2-bit ops; software-side pruning-aware fine-tuning and greedy DSE to find Pareto-optimal mixed-quantized models; include voltage scaling and cycle-accurate emulation.

Result: Experiments on DNNs/datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) show ~17.6x speedup with under 1% accuracy loss; up to 1.8 TOPs/W; outperforms ISA-agnostic RISC-V cores.

Conclusion: The MaRVIn framework demonstrates that cross-layer design integrating mixed-precision quantization with ISA/hardware optimizations and energy management can significantly improve DL inference efficiency on RISC-V, addressing inefficiencies in current embedded platforms.

Abstract: The evolution of quantization and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new
possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several
recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different
parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while
significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded
microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing
mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,
resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and
underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions
and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize
mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on
RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software
co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a
combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level
optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance
the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for
weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while
implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we
integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and
a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal
mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost
the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely
used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our
framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss
and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up
to 1.8 TOPs/W.

### [141] [Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection, Novelty Promotes Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15194)
*Yujun Zhou,Zhenwen Liang,Haolin Liu,Wenhao Yu,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xiangliang Zhang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOL-RL is a label-free reinforcement learning method for LLMs that counteracts entropy collapse by combining a stable majority-vote anchor with a novelty-driven variation reward in semantic space, implemented with GRPO, plus asymmetric clipping and entropy regularization. It enhances exploration, maintains longer chains of thought, and improves generalization, outperforming prior label-free baselines on AIME and GPQA, and benefitting RLVR as well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free RL for LLMs often stabilizes learning but causes entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle, reducing exploration and generalization. A method is needed that preserves exploration capabilities while enabling self-improvement without external labels or judges.

Method: Propose EVOL-RL, which uses a majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) and adds a novelty-aware reward based on semantic differences from what has already been produced (variation). Implemented with GRPO, includes asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. Evaluates by training on label-free data (AIME24) and testing generalization (GPQA), plus RLVR.

Result: Empirically, EVOL-RL outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline. In AIME24 experiments, Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 rises from 4.6% (TTRL) to 16.4%; pass@16 rises from 18.5% to 37.9%. The method also achieves stronger generalization across domains (GPQA) and prevents diversity collapse, maintaining longer and more informative chains of thought. It also boosts performance in RLVR settings.

Conclusion: EVOL-RL provides a simple, effective rule that couples stability with variation to preserve exploration, enabling broader generalization and stronger performance without labels. Its majority-for-selection plus novelty-for-variation design, together with GRPO, asymmetric clipping, and entropy regularization, yields robust improvements over prior label-free baselines and generalizes across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

TL;DR: A novel interpretability method for ECG CNNs that extracts time-localized clusters from internal representations to segment ECG and quantify uncertainty, enabling visualization of waveform-region contributions and improving trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability of deep learning models in ECG is limited; clinicians need transparent reasoning and reliable uncertainty estimates to trust AI diagnoses and to discover clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.

Method: Identify and extract time-localized clusters in the model's internal CNN representations; segment ECG based on learned characteristics; quantify uncertainty of these representations; visualize how waveform regions contribute to predictions.

Result: Proposes the method and demonstrates interpretability and uncertainty visualization, enabling a structured view and potential discovery of clinically relevant patterns; the abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: The approach provides a structured, interpretable view of deep learning models for ECG, enhancing trust in AI-driven diagnostics and facilitating electrophysiological insight.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis,
enabling automatic annotation, disease screening, and prognosis beyond
traditional clinical capabilities. However, understanding these models remains
a challenge, limiting interpretation and gaining knowledge from these
developments. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method for
convolutional neural networks applied to ECG analysis. Our approach extracts
time-localized clusters from the model's internal representations, segmenting
the ECG according to the learned characteristics while quantifying the
uncertainty of these representations. This allows us to visualize how different
waveform regions contribute to the model's predictions and assess the certainty
of its decisions. By providing a structured and interpretable view of deep
learning models for ECG, our method enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics and
facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.

*Ying Zheng,Yangfan Jiang,Kian-Lee Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable data-preprocessing framework, CausalPre, enables justifiable causal fairness without assuming a full causal model, via distribution-estimation and low-dimensional marginal factorization; experiments show it is effective and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to achieve causal fairness without strong assumptions about the underlying causal model while preserving utility by capturing wide attribute relationships. Existing methods often rely on fixed causal graphs or trade off relationship coverage for tractability.

Method: CausalPre reframes the extraction of causally fair relationships as a distribution-estimation problem. It uses a low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution and employs a heuristic algorithm to efficiently tackle the computational challenge of the estimation task.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

Conclusion: CausalPre provides a scalable, justifiable fairness solution that leverages causal reasoning without needing strong causal-model assumptions, enabling broader relationship capture while maintaining utility.

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate
outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal
model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional
constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute
relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a
fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design
efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong
assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer
this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective
causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable
fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair
relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally
infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To
ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of
low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,
complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated
computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the
conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off
relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

Motivation: Addresses a gap where most studies focus on single metro lines; cross-line coordination and rapid replanning during disruptions are underexplored, yet essential for scalable, reliable operations in smart cities.

Method: Develop a hierarchical time-space network model representing the unified crew action space, with constraints for heterogeneous qualifications and preferences; apply solution algorithms based on column generation and shortest-path adjustment; validate with real-world data.

Result: Outperforms benchmark heuristics in cost reduction and task completion; reveals notable efficiency gains from cross-line operations, especially for urgent tasks during disruptions.

Conclusion: Global optimization and cross-line coordination are crucial for efficient, reliable multi-line metro operations; the framework provides actionable insights for smart-city public transit management.

Abstract: Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it
directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public
transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective
multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for
large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on
individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination
and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework
is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with
heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model
is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally
efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous
qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation
and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed
network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both
cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by
incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during
disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and
cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing
insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation
in smart cities.

### [145] [From Capabilities to Performance: Evaluating Key Functional Properties of LLM Architectures in Penetration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14289)
*Lanxiao Huang,Daksh Dave,Ming Jin,Tyler Cody,Peter Beling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augmenting modular LLM agents with five core capabilities (GCM, IAM, CCI, AP, RTM) markedly boosts performance and reliability in realistic penetration testing tasks, especially for multi-step and real-time scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how effective LLM-based agents are across attack phases and identify design factors that enable reliable, real-time, multi-step penetration testing.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular, across realistic pentest scenarios; measure performance and recurring failure patterns; perform targeted augmentations to isolate impact of five capabilities: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM); analyze improvements and failure modes.

Result: Targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance; some architectures already exhibit subsets of desired properties; improvements are especially pronounced in complex, multi-step, and real-time tasks; better context retention, coordination, tool use accuracy, planning, and monitoring.

Conclusion: Incorporating targeted functional augmentations can materially enhance LLM-based penetration testing agents, guiding future design toward modular architectures with robust context, coordination, planning, and real-time adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment
penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack
phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple
LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic
penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring
failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional
capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM),
Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive
Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support,
respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component
coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective
execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery,
and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some
architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted
augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in
complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

*Daniel Röder,Akhil Juneja,Roland Roller,Sven Schmeier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a modular, stage-wise evaluation framework for LLM-powered web agents to diagnose intermediate errors, using SeeAct and Mind2Web as a case study; reveals weaknesses hidden by aggregate success metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks emphasize overall success and overlook intermediate errors, limiting understanding of failure modes and hindering systematic improvement.

Method: Introduce a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for fine-grained error analysis. Apply the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset as a case study to demonstrate how stage-wise diagnostics uncover actionable weaknesses beyond standard metrics.

Result: The framework exposes actionable weaknesses missed by traditional, single-metric evaluations and demonstrates potential for more robust and generalizable web agents through targeted error analysis.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, interpretable evaluation is essential for improving web agents; the modular framework provides a path toward systematic diagnostics and better generalization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform
complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current
evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate
errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic
improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of
fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular
evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages
for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web
dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable
weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and
generalizable web agents.

### [148] [From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) -- A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14474)
*Meltem Subasioglu,Nevzat Subasioglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract proposes True Intelligence (TI) defined by six core cognitive components and a five-level AGI taxonomy; it argues for a mechanism-based, brain-inspired framework over performance-metric definitions and claims Level-5 AGI is functionally equivalent to TI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance-based definitions of AGI are incomplete because they lack a clear mechanism-focused roadmap and do not capture the qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. The authors seek a brain-inspired, foundational cognitive-architecture framework to guide research.

Method: Define TI with six core components (embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and Interconnectedness). Propose a five-level AGI taxonomy based on the first five measurable components. Synthesize insights from analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures, and AI to ground a mechanism-based, actionable path.

Result: A holistic, mechanism-based definition of AGI (TI) and a practical research roadmap with developmental milestones. The five-level taxonomy culminates in Level-5 being functionally equivalent to TI, suggesting consciousness emerges from integrated higher-order cognition and is treated as an emergent byproduct rather than a prerequisite.

Conclusion: The work supplies a first holistic, mechanism-based AGI framework with clear milestones and a close, brain-inspired perspective. It argues that once Level-5 is achieved, AGI and TI are essentially the same, with consciousness viewed as an emergent, non-essential byproduct. This provides a concrete path for researchers, while inviting scrutiny of its measurements and philosophical implications.

Abstract: The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to
two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus
replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current
performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,
mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the
qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human
brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to
the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True
Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied
sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a
highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and
lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize
results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,
five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable
components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with
developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building
genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5
AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it
and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and
given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,
higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and
practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from
analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures
and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based
definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research
community.

*Marko Tesic,Yue Zhao,Joel Z. Leibo,Rakshit S. Trivedi,Jose Hernandez-Orallo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian Measurement Layouts infer multi-agent capability profiles in Melting Pot; findings show prosocial ability doesn't always predict performance and top results may exploit evaluation biases; recommendations to improve evaluation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate AI social capabilities in complex environments and move beyond simple game-theoretic outcomes to understand embodied cooperation and convention-following.

Method: Apply Measurement Layouts, a Bayesian approach, to infer capability profiles from Melting Pot contest interactions and use these profiles to predict performance.

Result: Capability profiles predict future performance and reveal prosocial abilities; higher prosocial skills don't universally correlate with better results; some high performers succeed without requiring prosocial behavior and may exploit testing biases; top submission potentially relied on a hard-coded, environment-specific solution.

Conclusion: Measurement Layouts provide accurate, actionable insights and highlight biases in current evaluation frameworks; improving annotation of cooperation demands is needed for generalizable AI social evaluation.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require
complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally
emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent
populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention
following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The
Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the
cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian
approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of
multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability
profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but
also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis
indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with
better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents
exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that
top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in
scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,
together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution
tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing
team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,
potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide
recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose
future research directions to account for biases introduced by different
testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer
both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more
transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex
social settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new 1,500-question DeKeyNLU dataset refines task decomposition and keyword extraction for NL2SQL, enabling a three-module DeKeySQL RAG pipeline that boosts SQL accuracy on Bird and Spider benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NL2SQL suffers from inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs; existing datasets under-annotate domain-specific keywords and risk task fragmentation, hindering RAG-based NL2SQL systems.

Method: Introduce DeKeyNLU with 1,500 annotated QA pairs focusing on task decomposition and keyword extraction; implement DeKeySQL, a three-module RAG pipeline (user question understanding, entity retrieval, generation); fine-tune on DeKeyNLU; benchmark configurations on Bird and Spider.

Result: Fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU improves SQL generation accuracy from 62.31% to 69.10% on Bird dev and 84.2% to 88.7% on Spider dev.

Conclusion: DeKeyNLU effectively mitigates decomposition and keyword extraction bottlenecks, enhancing NL2SQL performance; the dataset strengthens RAG-based NL2SQL pipelines and supports broader domain adaptation.

Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that
simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural
language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance.
However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword
extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL
generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning
models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of
domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500
meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and
enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with
DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three
distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and
generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model
configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate
that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy
on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

*Zhilun Zhou,Jing Yi Wang,Nicholas Sukiennik,Chen Gao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li,James Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new omnibus rationality benchmark for LLMs assesses theoretical and practical rationality across diverse domains, equipped with a toolkit and cross-model results, to serve as a foundational evaluation tool for developers and users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing concern that LLMs may not exhibit rational thinking or decision-making akin to humans. Rationality (theory of mind in thinking; applicability in action) is central to evaluating AI agents. A broad, standardized benchmark across domains is needed to quantify and compare rational behavior in LLMs.

Method: Proposes an omnibus rationality benchmark spanning both theoretical (logical inference, belief formation, consistency) and practical (goal-directed action, resource management, risk-aware decision making) rationality. Includes an easy-to-use toolkit and conducts extensive experiments across multiple LLMs over diverse tasks, analyzing convergence/divergence from ideal human rationality.

Result: Introduction of a usable benchmark and toolkit, accompanied by extensive experimental results showing how current LLMs align with or deviate from ideal rationality across domains, and providing insights into where improvements are most needed.

Conclusion: The benchmark is presented as a foundational tool for developers and users to evaluate and improve LLM rationality, potentially guiding future research and development in AI alignment and reliable deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine
intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the
most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like
capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants
across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether
and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.
Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,
both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,
practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for
evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains
and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental
results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from
idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a
foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.

*Yi Lin,Lujin Zhao,Yijie Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An a priori dynamic framework for automated LLM workflow construction that combines Q-table-based decision optimization with task-aware agent selection, achieving improved task-solving performance and efficiency over baselines on four benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous workflow methods over-rely on historical experience, which can limit efficiency and adaptability to task-specific characteristics. There is a need for flexible, per-task workflow construction.

Method: Introduce an a priori dynamic framework: use Q-table learning to optimize the decision space and guide agent decisions while leveraging historical experience; evaluate current task progress to make a priori decisions on the next executing agent, enabling proactive selection of the most suitable workflow structure for each task; integrate cold-start initialization, early stopping, and pruning to boost efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows feasibility and effectiveness, with an average improvement of 4.05% over state-of-the-art baselines and substantial cost reductions in workflow construction and inference (to 30.68%–48.31% of the costs of existing methods).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances leveraging historical experience with task-specific dynamic adaptation, delivering measurable performance gains and efficiency improvements; it offers a promising direction for automating adaptive LLM workflow construction, though details on scalability and broader applicability warrant further study.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating
large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities
compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on
autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on
historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability.
We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction
should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To
this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow
construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the
decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of
historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task
progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent,
allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure
for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start
initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing
workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those
required by existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DP-based synthetic text generation for domain-specific high-stakes data remains challenging, even with large language models; the paper presents a standardized evaluation framework, a large-scale benchmarking study, and a membership inference attack (MIA) for synthetic text, revealing privacy vulnerabilities and gaps between open-domain and specialist settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes domains (healthcare, finance) face data sharing barriers due to regulatory, institutional, and privacy concerns. While DP offers principled privacy for synthetic data, current methods struggle with unstructured text and domain complexity; there is a need for rigorous evaluation and privacy auditing to enable responsible deployment of generative AI.

Method: 1) Propose a standardized evaluation framework with nine curated datasets capturing domain-specific complexities (technical jargon, long-context dependencies, specialized structures); 2) Conduct a large-scale empirical study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs across sizes and fine-tuning strategies; 3) Develop a MIA methodology tailored for synthetic text to assess privacy guarantees in the presence of potential pretraining data leakage.

Result: High-quality domain-specific synthetic data under DP remains an unsolved challenge; performance deteriorates as domain complexity increases across datasets and models. The MIA reveals that using public datasets (potentially in pre-training corpora) can invalidate claimed privacy guarantees, underscoring the need for privacy auditing.

Conclusion: There are persistent gaps between open-domain and specialist evaluations, underscoring the need for rigorous privacy auditing and cautious deployment of generative AI in privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and
finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory,
institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as
large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks,
their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable
behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking.
Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for
unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification.
Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the
generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we
address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity
metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific
complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and
specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of
varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality
domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an
unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases.
Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for
synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public
datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed
privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous
privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and
specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in
privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.

Motivation: Current evaluation methods fail to capture errors, emergent behaviors, and systemic failures in complex, multi-agent LLM workflows after deployment; there is a need for developer-centric monitoring and debugging tools.

Method: A structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic summarization, plus a dual episodic/semantic memory system for continual learning across runs; validated in real-world deployments and against TRAIL.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on key metrics; identifies critical issues missed by human annotations; demonstrates practical utility in production settings.

Conclusion: AgentCompass provides a robust framework for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic systems in production, serving as a developer-centric tool for reducing errors and systemic failures in complex workflows.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating
complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors,
emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail
to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed
specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows.
AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a
structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and
categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic
summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory
system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions.
Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's
practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy
against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves
state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues
missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust,

TL;DR: Introduces Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to analyze Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), creating a benchmark with annotated cognitive labels to study the structure of model-generated chain-of-thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of principled understanding of how LRMs structure their reasoning by applying a classic cognitive framework to annotate and interpret reasoning traces, enabling greater transparency and controllability.

Method: Annotates thousands of sentences/paragraphs from model-generated math solutions using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify), builds the first publicly available fine-grained reasoning benchmark with an annotation guide, and analyzes transition dynamics between cognitive states.

Result: Provides the first publicly available benchmark for fine-grained machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and annotation guides; reveals distinct patterns in reasoning and transitions between cognitive states across solutions.

Conclusion: Offers a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM cognition and lays the groundwork for more controllable and transparent reasoning systems in future work.

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought
reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts
are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying
Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human
mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We
annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions
to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify).
The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained
analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed
annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in
LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This
framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM
cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent
reasoning systems.

TL;DR: RationAnomaly combines chain-of-thought fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve log anomaly detection, achieving better F1 and providing interpretable step-by-step reasoning, with released code/datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome interpretability and generalization gaps of DL-based log anomaly detection and to mitigate LLM hallucinations in log analysis, by ensembling CoT reasoning with RL optimization.

Method: Two-stage: (1) CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning on expert-corrected high-quality data to instill reasoning patterns. (2) RL with a multi-faceted reward to maximize accuracy and logical consistency, reducing hallucinations, plus produce transparent outputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key log anomaly benchmarks in F1, and provides transparent, stepwise analyses; resources (code/datasets) released.

Conclusion: The integration of CoT-tuned reasoning with RL yields more accurate and interpretable log anomaly detectors, suggesting a generalizable approach for reliable ML-assisted software monitoring.

Abstract: Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of
software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the
reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face
significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability
and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often
hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we
propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by
synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our
approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided
supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a
rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase
with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical
consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally,
RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior
F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step

### [157] [The NazoNazo Benchmark: A Cost-Effective and Extensible Test of Insight-Based Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14704)
*Masaharu Mizumoto,Dat Nguyen,Zhiheng Han,Jiyuan Fang,Heyuan Guan,Xingfu Li,Naoya Shiraishi,Xuyang Tian,Yo Nakawake,Le Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nazonazo is a scalable, renewable benchmark of insight-based reasoning using Japanese children's riddles; it shows reasoning-based models outperform non-reasoners, with GPT-5 approaching or matching human performance, while model size does not predict accuracy; the analysis highlights meta-cognitive verification failures, offering targets for model calibration and reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address benchmark saturation and contamination in LLM evaluation by providing a cost-effective, extensible benchmark that can be refreshed to detect leakage and support robust comparison of insight-based reasoning across models and humans.

Method: Construct a benchmark from short, domain-general riddles (mostly one sentence) that require no specialized knowledge; generate items at scale; evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles, with an extended 201-item analysis; analyze reasoning vs non-reasoning models and inspect thought logs for verification failures.

Result: GPT-5 performance is comparable to human accuracy (human mean ~52.9%); reasoning-based models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers; model size shows no reliable correlation with accuracy; many cases where the correct solution appears among intermediate candidates but is not chosen as the final answer; the benchmark is cost-effective, scalable, and renewable, and reveals meta-cognitive weakness that informs future control/calibration.

Conclusion: Nazonazo provides a practical solution to the current evaluation crisis by offering a renewable, scalable benchmark that supports blind refreshes and highlights a clear meta-cognitive target for improvement; it also emphasizes decoupling model size from performance and focusing on reasoning and verification processes.

Abstract: Benchmark saturation and contamination undermine confidence in LLM
evaluation. We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark
built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items
are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and
can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is
suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No
model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a
52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that
reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size
shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an
informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of
verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among
intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we
illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo
thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format
that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent
meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and
calibration methods.

### [158] [Enhancing Retrieval Augmentation via Adversarial Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14750)
*Letian Zhang,Guanghao Meng,Xudong Ren,Yiming Wang,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AC-RAG introduces an adversarial collaboration between a Detector and a Resolver to mitigate retrieval hallucinations in Retrieval-augmented Generation, yielding improved retrieval accuracy and state-of-the-art performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems suffer from retrieval hallucinations where poor-quality retrieved documents are not recognized or corrected; there is a need for mechanisms to detect and rectify knowledge gaps using diverse agents.

Method: Two heterogeneous agents guided by a moderator: Detector (generalist) identifies knowledge gaps; Resolver (domain-specialized) provides precise solutions; through adversarial collaboration, the Detector questions the Resolver, enabling iterative problem dissection and refined retrieval.

Result: AC-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across multiple vertical domains, based on extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Adversarial collaboration between a detector and a resolver is an effective strategy to reduce retrieval hallucinations in RAG and generalizes across domains, offering robustness and improved knowledge retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for
domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a
phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality
retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose
the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two
heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and
a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a
moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the
Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This
dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge
retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves
retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various
vertical domains.

### [159] [OpenLens AI: Fully Autonomous Research Agent for Health Infomatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14778)
*Yuxiao Cheng,Jinli Suo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenLens AI is a fully automated, domain-adapted framework for health informatics that uses LLM-based agents and vision-language feedback to automate literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, delivering publication-ready, reproducible LaTeX manuscripts while handling medical visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health informatics combines diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge growth, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. Current LLM-driven systems struggle with interpreting medical visualizations and meeting domain-specific quality/reproducibility standards, creating a gap for automated research workflows.

Conclusion: OpenLens AI provides a domain-adapted, automated research framework that addresses visualization interpretation and reproducibility challenges in health informatics, enabling end-to-end execution from literature review to manuscript generation.

Abstract: Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities,
rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical
science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it
particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge
exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful
outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has
demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and
even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited
for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical
visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To
address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework
tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for
literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation,
enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality
control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research
pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and
traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing
health informatics research.

### [160] [Explainable AI for Infection Prevention and Control: Modeling CPE Acquisition and Patient Outcomes in an Irish Hospital with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14942)
*Minh-Khoi Pham,Tai Tan Mai,Martin Crane,Rob Brennan,Marie E. Ward,Una Geary,Declan Byrne,Brian O Connell,Colm Bergin,Donncha Creagh,Nick McDonald,Marija Bezbradica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer-based explainable AI on Irish EMR data predicts CPE-related outcomes; TabTransformer outperforms baselines; infection features and network metrics (Ward PageRank) are strong risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) pose infection control challenges. Predictive modeling for readmission, mortality, and extended LOS using modern deep learning and explainability remains underexplored, especially with EMR data.

Method: Benchmark Transformer-based architectures (including TabTransformer) alongside traditional ML on inpatient EMR data: diagnostic codes, ward transitions, demographics, infection-related variables, and contact network features; predict clinical outcomes and CPE acquisition; apply explainable AI techniques to interpret model decisions.

Result: Transformer models, notably TabTransformer, outperform baselines across multiple prediction tasks; AUROC and sensitivity are improved for CPE acquisition. Infection-related features (historical hospital exposure, admission context) and network centrality measures are highly influential. Explainability highlights Area of Residence, Admission Ward, prior admissions, and Ward PageRank as key risk factors.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust, explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes, demonstrating the superiority of Transformer models and the value of diverse clinical and network features.

Abstract: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for
infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of
previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and
extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern
deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling
framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical
Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an
Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient
demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several
Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine
learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were
applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated
the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently
outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially
for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related
features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and
network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient
outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that
features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are
key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly,
reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study
presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data
to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings
underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the
importance of diverse clinical and network features.

### [161] [Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14956)
*Diego Gosmar,Deborah A. Dahl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-layer security architecture for multi-agent systems using Sentinel Agents and a Coordinator Agent, enabling semantic monitoring, anomaly detection, and adaptive policy enforcement; validated in simulation with 162 synthetic attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve security, reliability, privacy, and auditability in MAS amidst threats like prompt injection, LLM hallucinations, and data exfiltration.

Method: Architectural framework with Sentinel Agents performing semantic analysis, behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection; Coordinator Agent governs policy, aggregates alerts, and quarantines misbehaving agents; evaluated via a simulation injecting 162 synthetic attacks into a multi-agent conversational environment.

Result: Sentinel Agents detected attack attempts; demonstrated feasibility of continuous monitoring; improved observability and governance; potential isolation/quarantine of misbehaving agents; supports compliance and policy evolution.

Conclusion: Dual-layer Sentinel+Coordinator security is a dynamic, adaptable defense for MAS, enabling robust threat detection, response, and governance, with practical feasibility demonstrated in simulation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing
security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of
this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed
security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large
language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,
and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee
inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and
access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the
idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator
Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In
addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on
these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,
and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This
dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel
Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic
and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt
injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy
breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural
design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different
families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected
into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully
detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the
proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system
observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution
over time.

*Filip Naudot,Andreas Brännström,Vicenç Torra,Timotheus Kampik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends the notion of contribution from a single argument to sets of arguments in quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs. Develops a principle-based framework for set-contribution functions, introduces interaction-focused principles, and sketches a recommendation-system scenario to illustrate behavior across different set functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how a group of arguments jointly influences the strength of a target topic (the topic) while accounting for interactions among arguments, thereby extending existing single-argument contribution theories to sets.

Method: Define and study set-contribution functions that quantify a set's aggregate impact on a topic. Generalize existing contribution principles from single arguments to sets, introduce new principles specific to set interactions, and provide a principle-based analysis. Include a scenario sketch showing how these principles apply to various set-contribution functions in a recommendation-system context.

Result: A generalized, principle-based framework for set contributions in quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs, including generalized functions, a set-specific principle suite, and an illustrative sketch of how these principles manifest across different set-contribution functions in a recommendation-system application.

Conclusion: The work offers a structured, principled approach to evaluating how sets of arguments contribute to a topic within AB graphs, enabling systematic comparisons and guiding design choices for set-based contributions in applications like recommender systems.

Abstract: We present functions that quantify the contribution of a set of arguments in
quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs to (the final strength of) an
argument of interest, a so-called topic. Our set contribution functions are
generalizations of existing functions that quantify the contribution of a
single contributing argument to a topic. Accordingly, we generalize existing
contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a
corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to
set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of
arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across
different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application
scenario.

### [163] [A Knowledge-driven Adaptive Collaboration of LLMs for Enhancing Medical Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14998)
*Xiao Wu,Ting-Zhu Huang,Liang-Jian Deng,Yanyuan Qiao,Imran Razzak,Yutong Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAMAC enables dynamic, knowledge-driven collaboration among LLM agents, forming adaptive expert teams to fill knowledge gaps in medical decision-making. It outperforms single-agent and static multi-agent baselines on two real-world benchmarks, especially in complex cancer prognosis tasks; code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the rigidity of static, pre-assigned roles in multi-agent LLM collaborations, which limit adaptability and cross-specialty knowledge integration in clinical decision making.

Method: Begin with one or more expert agents and run a knowledge-driven discussion to identify missing knowledge. Recruit additional specialists as needed, forming adaptive teams. Final decisions are made by reviewing updated agent comments.

Result: Significant performance improvements over both single-agent and advanced multi-agent baselines on two real-world medical benchmarks, with pronounced gains in complex, cross-specialty scenarios such as cancer prognosis.

Conclusion: KAMAC enables flexible, scalable collaboration for complex clinical decision support by dynamically forming specialist teams as needed; demonstrated strong results and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple
clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams.
Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate
expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent
interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder
adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations,
we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration
framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams
based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert
agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill
knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports
flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions
finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two
real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms
both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex
clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty
expertise. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated metareviews function as formative assessment feedback and whether they align with theories of meaning in communication.

Method: Qualitative analysis of 120 metareviews from graduate online courses at a public U.S. university, using Systemic Functional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory to examine ideational, interpersonal, and textual meaning.

Result: AI-generated metafeedback can approximate key rhetorical and relational features of effective human feedback, offering directive clarity with a supportive stance, balancing praise and critique, aligning with rubrics, and providing structured staging that foregrounds student agency.

Conclusion: AI metafeedback has potential to scaffold feedback literacy and enhance learner engagement in peer review.

Abstract: This study investigates the use of generative AI to support formative
assessment through machine generated reviews of peer reviews in graduate online
courses in a public university in the United States. Drawing on Systemic
Functional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory, we analyzed 120 metareviews to
explore how generative AI feedback constructs meaning across ideational,
interpersonal, and textual dimensions. The findings suggest that generative AI
can approximate key rhetorical and relational features of effective human
feedback, offering directive clarity while also maintaining a supportive
stance. The reviews analyzed demonstrated a balance of praise and constructive
critique, alignment with rubric expectations, and structured staging that
foregrounded student agency. By modeling these qualities, AI metafeedback has
the potential to scaffold feedback literacy and enhance leaner engagement with
peer review.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a domain-specific survey to capture maritime professionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability to support user-centered XAI deployment in maritime operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In autonomous maritime operations, transparency and interpretability of AI decisions are essential for trust, safety, and effective human–machine teaming; there is a need for user-centered tools tailored to seafarers.

Method: Development of a domain-specific survey instrument targeting maritime professionals, designed to assess trust, usability, and explainability of AI systems, informing design decisions.

Result: The paper yields a proposed survey instrument and a framework to interpret results, intended to foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems for the maritime domain.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes XAI as foundational for effective human–machine collaboration in maritime and advocates for user-centered, domain-tailored XAI solutions.

Abstract: As autonomous technologies increasingly shape maritime operations,
understanding why an AI system makes a decision becomes as crucial as what it
decides. In complex and dynamic maritime environments, trust in AI depends not
only on performance but also on transparency and interpretability. This paper
highlights the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for effective
human-machine teaming in the maritime domain, where informed oversight and
shared understanding are essential. To support the user-centered integration of
XAI, we propose a domain-specific survey designed to capture maritime
professionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability. Our aim is
to foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems
tailored to the needs of seafarers and maritime teams.

### [166] [Internalizing Self-Consistency in Language Models: Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15172)
*Ankur Samanta,Akshayaa Magesh,Youliang Yu,Runzhe Wu,Ayush Jain,Daniel Jiang,Boris Vidolov,Paul Sajda,Yonathan Efroni,Kaveh Hassani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MACA is a post-training reinforcement learning framework where multiple agents debate to align reasoning with internal consensus, guiding LMs to more reliable, concise reasoning and achieving strong gains across self-consistency and reasoning benchmarks, with good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often produce inconsistent or contradictory answers due to poor selection of reasoning pathways. Inference-time fixes address symptoms but not the root cause. The work formalizes self-consistency and seeks intrinsic alignment of reasoning trajectories with internal consensus to unlock latent reasoning potential.

Method: Introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a post-training RL framework where agents engage in deliberative debates and use majority/minority outcomes as supervision to align their reasoning trajectories with the model's internal consensus. The approach grounds reasoning in peer arguments rather than simple majority voting, encourages decisive and concise reasoning, and leverages internal consensus signals without external supervision.

Result: Significant improvements across tasks: self-consistency +27.6% on GSM8K; single-agent reasoning +23.7% on MATH; sampling-based inference +22.4% P@20 on MATH; multi-agent ensemble decision-making +42.7% on MathQA. Generalizes to unseen benchmarks: +16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA.

Conclusion: MACA enables self-alignment by teaching agents to rely on peer-derived consensus in deliberation, improving consistency and latent reasoning capacity, while generalizing well to new benchmarks; it demonstrates that richer consensus signals from multi-agent debates can unlock more reliable reasoning without external supervision.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating
contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can
mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs
struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes
under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as
an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce
Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that
post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal
consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These
trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning
in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating
richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents
to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer
insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving
substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K),
single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4%
Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).
These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3%
on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more
reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.

*Yue Xin,Wenyuan Wang,Rui Pan,Ruida Wang,Howard Meng,Renjie Pi,Shizhe Diao,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-generation framework using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations, aiming to improve multimodal LLMs' geometry reasoning and generalization, yielding 2.8–4.8% gains on MathVista/MathVerse and 2.4–3.9% on MMMU across various tasks, including out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of high-quality image-text pairs for geometric reasoning; template-based data synthesis fails to generalize beyond fixed templates, hindering MLLMs' ability to reason about geometry.

Method: Generate geometric images from 50 basic relations; apply RLVR to refine captions; use reward signals from math problem-solving tasks to guide caption quality; produce a dataset that captures geometry problem-solving features and supports better generalization.

Result: Improved general reasoning in multimodal LLMs, with non-trivial accuracy improvements across statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks, and cross-domain gains in MMMU.

Conclusion: RLVR-based data generation effectively aligns captions with geometry problem-solving requirements, enhancing out-of-distribution generalization and overall reasoning performance of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that
demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models
still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from
the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric
images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically
fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation
pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized
from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from
mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key
features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization
and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution
scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of
$2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks
with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with
$2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks
in MMMU.

*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Local State Attention (LSA) uses self-attention to compress information from nearby agents, improving MARL-based highway merging performance in dense traffic and under stochastic events, outperforming baselines like MAPPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate local conflicts and lack of generalization in multi-agent reinforcement learning for mixed-traffic scenarios by enhancing state representations with focused nearby-agent information.

Method: Introduce a Local State Attention module that applies self-attention to encode and prioritize information from nearby agents within the state representation, and integrate it into MARL training (e.g., MAPPO) for highway merging with a priority vehicle as an unexpected event.

Result: Significant improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially under high-density traffic conditions.

Conclusion: Local State Attention improves conflict resolution and robustness in dense mixed-traffic MARL, enabling better handling of stochastic events and improving overall merging performance.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

*Lucas de Oliveira Silva,Lehilton Lelis Chaves Pedrosa*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: FTP is strongly NP-hard in the Euclidean plane under the Manhattan (L1) distance, resolving the open question for R^2 under L1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the computational difficulty of activating a robot swarm in geometric settings, informing algorithm design for swarm activation and related scheduling problems.

Method: A strong NP-hardness reduction from a known strongly NP-hard problem to FTP in the 2D plane with L1 distance.

Result: The paper proves that FTP is strongly NP-hard in the Euclidean plane with L1 distance.

Conclusion: Completes the complexity classification of FTP in 2D, resolving the previously open case for L1; motivates future work on exact algorithms, approximations, or fixed-parameter tractability for FTP in geometric settings.

Abstract: The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) is a scheduling problem with application in
robot swarm activation and was introduced by Arkin et al. in 2002. This problem
seeks an efficient way of activating a robot swarm starting with a single
active robot. Activations occur through direct contact, and once a robot
becomes active, it can move and help activate other robots.
  Although the problem has been shown to be NP-hard in the Euclidean plane
$R^2$ under the $L_2$ distance, and in three-dimensional Euclidean space $R^3$
under any $L_p$ distance with $p \ge 1$, its complexity under the $L_1$
(Manhattan) distance in $R^2$ has remained an open question. In this paper, we
settle this question by proving that FTP is strongly NP-hard in the Euclidean
plane with $L_1$ distance.

### [170] [Realizing Metric Spaces with Convex Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14709)
*Sándor Kisfaludi-Bak,Leonidas Theocharous*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: In 3D, the realizability of finite metric spaces via geodesic distances around obstacles depends on three properties: fatness, convexity, and disjointness. Dropping fatness lets convex, disjoint obstacles realize any finite metric with distortion 1+ε; keeping fatness but dropping convexity or disjointness also suffices. These results imply a PTAS for TSP with Obstacles when obstacles are convex, fat, and disjoint; removing any of these properties makes the problem APX-hard (via known reductions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how obstacle geometry in three dimensions shapes induced geodesic metrics and the computability/approximability of problems like TSP with Obstacles. Extend plane results to 3D and connect to existing TSP in doubling spaces and obstacle-distance literature.

Method: Provide constructive geometric realizations showing that any finite metric space can be embedded with distortion 1+ε into the free space around chosen obstacles under different property relaxations (dropping fatness; dropping convexity; dropping disjointness). Use known results (Banerjee et al. on TSP in doubling spaces, Chew et al. on obstacle distances) to translate these realizability results into algorithmic consequences, yielding a PTAS for TSP with Obstacles under convex, fat, disjoint obstacles, and APX-hardness when any property is dropped.

Result: Main theoretical realizations: (i) If fatness is dropped, convex, pairwise disjoint obstacles in R^3 (even congruent equilateral triangles) realize every finite metric space with distortion 1+ε. (ii) If fatness is enforced but convexity or disjointness is dropped, the same realizability holds. Algorithmic consequence: TSP with Obstacles admits a PTAS when obstacles are convex, fat, and pairwise disjoint; otherwise, due to APX-hardness of Metric TSP and the realizability results, TSP with Obstacles is APX-hard.

Conclusion: The three obstacle properties critically determine the approximability of TSP with Obstacles in 3D. The work identifies precise condition sets under which near-optimal (PTAS) solutions exist and shows hardness when any property is relaxed, guiding both geometric design of obstacle environments and complexity understanding of obstacle-aware routing.

Abstract: The presence of obstacles has a major impact on distance computation, motion
planning, and visibility. While these problems are well studied in the plane,
our understanding in three and higher dimensions is still limited. We
investigate how different obstacle properties affect the induced geodesic
metric in three-dimensional space. A finite metric space is said to be
approximately realizable by a collection of obstacles if, for any
$\varepsilon>0$, it can be embedded into the free space around the obstacles
with geodesic distance and worst-case distortion $1+\varepsilon$. We focus on
three key properties-convexity, disjointness, and fatness-and analyze how
omitting each of them influences realizability.
  Our main result shows that if fatness is dropped, then every finite metric
space can be realized with distortion $1+\varepsilon$ using convex, pairwise
disjoint obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^3$, even if all obstacles are congruent
equilateral triangles. Moreover, if we enforce fatness but drop convexity or
disjointness, the same realizability still holds.
  Our results have important implications on the approximability of TSP with
Obstacles, a natural variant of TSP introduced recently by Alkema et al. (ESA
2022). Specifically, we use the recent results of Banerjee et al. on TSP in
doubling spaces (FOCS 2024) and of Chew et al. on distances among obstacles
(Information Processing Letters 2002) to show that TSP with Obstacles admits a
PTAS if the obstacles are convex, fat, and pairwise disjoint. If any of these
three properties is dropped, then our results, combined with the APX-hardness
of Metric TSP, demonstrate that TSP with Obstacles is APX-hard.

*Daniel E Widdowson,Vitaliy A Kurlin*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces Lipschitz continuity under noise for periodic point sets under isometry and designs invariants that separate known counterexamples, enabling fast detection of near-duplicates in large inorganic-crystal databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To robustly determine whether claimed crystals are truly novel or simply noisy perturbations of known materials, addressing biases from using discontinuous cells and symmetries that distort ground truth in crystal databases.

Method: Develop invariants for periodic point sets under isometry that remain stable under noise (Lipschitz continuity) and can distinguish all known counterexamples to past descriptors; demonstrate near-duplicate detection at scale on large inorganic-crystal databases using desktop computation.

Result: The proposed invariants successfully distinguish all known counterexamples to the completeness of past descriptors and enable verification of thousands of near-duplicates within hours on a desktop computer.

Conclusion: Lipschitz continuity under noise is a crucial criterion for ML on data with ambiguous, continuous representations; the invariants improve novelty screening and curation of crystal databases by reliably handling near-duplicates.

Abstract: Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose
atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types. This
paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals
are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic
atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth
because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries. The
proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for
machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and
live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any
distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish
all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm
thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic
crystals within hours on a desktop computer.

### [172] [AEGIS: Automated Error Generation and Identification for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295)
*Fanqi Kong,Ruijie Zhang,Huaxiao Yin,Guibin Zhang,Xiaofei Zhang,Ziang Chen,Zhaowei Zhang,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Song-Chun Zhu,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AEGIS automates error generation and labeling in multi-agent systems using an LLM-driven manipulator to inject controllable, traceable failures, enabling robust error-identification models trained via supervised, reinforcement learning, and contrastive learning; results show strong gains and competitive performance with much larger proprietary systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale, diverse, ground-truth error datasets for multi-agent systems, which hinders understanding error modes and ensuring reliability and safety.

Method: AEGIS framework injects controllable, traceable errors into initially successful trajectories. A context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator performs sophisticated attacks (e.g., prompt injection, response corruption) to induce predefined error modes, creating a rich dataset of realistic failures. The study evaluates three learning paradigms for error identification: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning, comparing performance on the generated data.

Result: Models trained on AEGIS data show substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Some fine-tuned models are competitive with or superior to much larger proprietary systems, validating automated data generation as a valuable resource for robust, interpretable MAS.

Conclusion: Automated error data generation via AEGIS is a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems, with broad applicability and potential to democratize access to high-quality failure data.

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

### [173] [FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303)
*Hao Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang,Yu Gao,Zhigang Sun,Yiru Wang,Yuwen Heng,Shuo Wang,Jinhao Chai,Zhuo Chen,Hao Zhao,Hao Sun,Xi Zhang,Anqing Jiang,Chuan Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields in BEV space to encode risk and lane priors for safe, interpretable trajectory planning; it decouples motion intent from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating; achieves state-of-the-art EPDMS on NAVSIM v2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end BEV-based planning lacks explicit modeling of risk and soft semantics (lane boundaries, traffic priors) and interpretable guidance, making safe planning difficult. A framework combining priors and interpretable cues could improve safety and multimodal planning.

Method: FlowDrive adds energy-based flow fields—risk potential and lane attraction—in BEV space to encode priors; uses flow-aware BEV features to refine anchor trajectories; introduces a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating to separate motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising, improving multimodal diversity.

Result: On NAVSIM v2, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, outperforming prior baselines in safety and planning quality.

Conclusion: By embedding physically interpretable priors into BEV via flow fields and decoupling intent from denoising, FlowDrive offers safer, more interpretable end-to-end planning with better multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is

### [174] [Multi-Quadruped Cooperative Object Transport: Learning Decentralized Pinch-Lift-Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14342)
*Bikram Pandit,Aayam Kumar Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decentralized, communication-free multi-robot transport: 2–10 quadrupeds with independent arms learn to move ungraspable objects by shaping rewards to mimic rigid contact, using a hierarchical policy and shared parameters to scale without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable decentralized coordination among independent robots to transport objects through contact forces alone, without communication or centralized control, addressing the challenge of achieving rigid-like behavior without mechanical coupling and enabling scalability to larger teams.

Method: A hierarchical policy: separate base locomotion from arm control; a constellation reward that jointly tracks position and orientation to enforce rigid contact behavior; training with a curriculum; shared policy parameters allow implicit synchronization cues; no explicit mechanical constraints or inter-robot communication.

Result: Extensive simulations show robust transport across 2–10 robots over diverse object geometries and masses; successful sim-to-real transfer on lightweight objects.

Conclusion: Coordination emerges from reward design and shared policies, enabling scalable decentralized transport without retraining for different team sizes and relying on implicit cues, with demonstrated sim-to-real applicability on simple objects.

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

*Zhengyang Kris Weng,Matthew L. Elwin,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LeVR is a modular VR teleoperation framework for robotic imitation learning that integrates with LeRobot IL and ships LeFranX for Franka FER and RobotEra XHand; it validates the approach using a 100-demo dataset to fine-tune visuomotor policies, and is released as open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two practical gaps in robotic imitation learning: (1) creating robust, intuitive VR-based teleoperation data collection for dexterous manipulation, and (2) providing native integration with an IL framework to streamline demonstration collection and policy training.

Method: Develop LeVR as a modular software platform offering VR teleoperation for robotic arms with dexterous hands, integrated with the LeRobot IL framework; release LeFranX (open-source) for Franka FER and RobotEra XHand; build an end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy deployment; collect a public dataset of expert demonstrations (100 sequences) and use it to fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor policies.

Result: A public dataset of 100 expert demonstrations was collected and used to successfully fine-tune high-performing visuomotor policies; established an end-to-end pipeline from data collection to policy deployment.

Conclusion: LeVR and LeFranX provide an accessible, end-to-end, open-source toolchain to accelerate imitation-learning research in robotics, particularly for dexterous manipulation tasks, by enabling robust VR data collection and seamless IL integration.

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot
arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing
systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation
learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and
streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we
release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and
RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert
demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor
policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamControl uses a diffusion-based prior trained on human motion to guide RL for whole-body humanoid skills, enabling harder tasks and more natural motions with improved sim-to-real transfer, validated on a Unitree G1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of direct RL for learning natural, robust, and transferable whole-body humanoid skills by injecting human motion priors to shape learning and motion realism.

Method: Train a diffusion model on human motion data to serve as a prior; integrate it with an RL policy in simulation to complete tasks (e.g., opening drawers, picking objects); apply to a Unitree G1 with coordinated lower and upper body control and object interaction.

Result: Diffusion-informed RL discovers solutions unattainable by direct RL; diffusion prior yields more natural motions and aids sim-to-real transfer; successful validation on hardware across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: DreamControl demonstrates that combining diffusion priors with RL enables capable, natural, and transferable whole-body humanoid control; the approach generalizes to tasks requiring simultaneous multi-limb coordination.

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

### [177] [CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380)
*Seoyeon Choi,Kanghyun Ryu,Jonghoon Ock,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRAFT uses LLMs as a coaching signal for MARL in robotics, planning long-horizon tasks into subtasks, generating and refining subtask rewards with LLMs and a VLM loop, and validating on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation including real hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome core MARL robotics challenges—high-dimensional continuous action spaces, reward design, and non-stationarity—by adopting a staged curriculum approach guided by foundation models, mirroring human skill-building.

Method: CRAFT decomposes long-horizon tasks into subtasks via planning with Large Language Models; it uses LLM-generated reward functions for each subtask and iteratively refines them through a Vision-Language Model guided loop; policies for subtasks are trained and then integrated, with tests on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation, including real-world hardware validation.

Result: The framework demonstrates learning of complex coordination behaviors; it is validated on simulated and real hardware setups, showing effective coordination in multi-robot tasks (navigation and manipulation).

Conclusion: Foundation models can act as autonomous coaches for MARL in robotics, enabling scalable task decomposition, reward design, and refinement, with demonstrated potential in real-world multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

*Yuhong Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment (RLBind) for robust unified embeddings across vision, audio, and other sensors, improving clean accuracy and norm-bounded robustness in robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multi-modal encoders bind vision, audio, and sensors into a shared space, but on-robot use exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions. Prior defenses mainly align clean/adversarial features within CLIP-like encoders and ignore broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and hurting zero-shot transfer.

Method: Stage 1: unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2: leverage cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities.

Result: RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness across Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data.

Conclusion: RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots, achieving improved robustness without sacrificing generalization and enabling safer autonomous navigation and manipulation.

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

*Artem Lykov,Oleg Kobzarev,Dzmitry Tsetserukou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GestOS proposes a gesture-based operating system that semantically interprets hand gestures to dynamically allocate tasks among heterogeneous robots via LLM reasoning and a real-time robot-selection module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, context-aware human–robot collaboration with heterogeneous robot teams that goes beyond fixed gesture mappings or single-agent control, enabling adaptive, user-friendly orchestration in dynamic environments.

Method: The system converts hand poses into structured textual descriptions using lightweight visual perception, uses a large language model to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands, and employs a robot-selection module to match tasks to the most suitable agent in real time, enabling context-aware, adaptive cloudless orchestration without explicit target specification.

Result: The abstract claims improved context-awareness, adaptability, and scalability through intelligent orchestration but provides no empirical results or quantitative evaluation in the abstract.

Conclusion: GestOS shifts gesture interaction from mere recognition to intelligent orchestration, enabling scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with multi-robot systems in dynamic settings.

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

### [180] [Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421)
*Dario Tscholl,Yashwanth Nakka,Brian Gunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An analytic safety filter converts each 3D Gaussian Splat into a forward collision cone, embedding a first-order CBF in a QP to enable proactive, efficient collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve proactive, real-time, safe navigation in perception-rich cluttered environments without resorting to high-order CBFs, and to improve planning speed and trajectory smoothness in challenging scenarios such as space robotics.

Method: Each 3D Gaussian Splat is transformed into a closed-form forward collision cone. This cone provides a first-order CBF constraint that is embedded in a quadratic program. The approach is fully analytic, avoids HOCBFs, and can be extended to robot shapes via Minkowski-sum inflation of the splats.

Result: Validated on a large synthetic scene with ~170k splats: planning time reduced by about 3×, trajectories exhibited significantly reduced jerk, while maintaining equivalent safety to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner.

Conclusion: The method is broadly applicable for real-time navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments (including space robotics), is scalable through Minkowski inflation, and relies on analytic collision constraints instead of reactive distance-based methods.

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

*Keqin Wang,Tao Zhong,David Chang,Christine Allen-Blanchette*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LEGO enables robust MARL for swarms by using Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks to achieve permutation/generalization across agent counts, enforce E(n)-equivariance, and inject role-specific biases, improving stability and performance in cooperative and competitive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL training is unstable in competitive tasks, generalization to different team sizes is poor, and policies degrade under agent failures; a symmetry-informed, heterogeneous architecture could improve stability and cross-configuration generalization.

Method: Incorporates graph neural networks into MARL (e.g., with MAPPO) to capture permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers, applies canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and uses heterogeneous representations to encode role-specific inductive biases; evaluated on cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks and real-world tests.

Result: LEGO outperforms strong baselines on swarm benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen agent counts and robustness to agent failures; demonstrated real-world resilience to varying team sizes.

Conclusion: LEGO provides a symmetry-aware, scalable MARL framework that can generalize across agent counts and remain robust under failures; compatible with existing MARL algorithms and applicable to real-world swarm tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Theory-of-Mind–driven RL for deception under sporadic supervision; introduces a scalar evidence-of-deviation weight used in a KL-regularized online RL update; validated on ASV/UAV hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under intermittent monitoring, agents pursue private objectives while appearing compliant. Real-world supervisors form beliefs about expected behavior; this work reframes deception as a belief-aware control problem and seeks a principled method rather than hand-tuned policies.

Method: Model the supervisor's expectations and distill them into a single calibrated scalar—the expected evidence of deviation if an observation is made now. This scalar combines how unlike the reference and current action distributions appear with the agent's belief that an observation is imminent. It is injected as a state-dependent weight into a KL-regularized policy improvement step in an online RL loop, yielding a closed-form update that trades off self-interest and compliance. The approach is validated in real-time hardware experiments.

Result: The ToM-guided RL runs online on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV) platforms, achieving high return and success with evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

Conclusion: A theory-of-mind–driven RL framework can steer online RL toward deceptive yet plausible behavior under sporadic supervision. The method provides a principled alternative to hand-crafted policies and shows promise for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

TL;DR: A method to learn discrete, graph-structured abstractions from vision for rearrangement tasks, enabling planning without hand-engineered abstractions.


<details>

Motivation: Hand-engineered abstractions hinder scalability in robotic planning. Automating abstraction discovery from raw visual data can bridge perception and planning, improving scalability and real-world applicability.

Method: Induce discrete graph-structured abstractions by combining structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance, exploiting the bipartite nature of rearrangement problems and unifying structure and vision into a single framework. Abstractions are learned from vision alone and used to support high-level planning.

Result: On two simulated rearrangement tasks, the method consistently discovers meaningful abstractions that facilitate planning and outperform existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach enables autonomous discovery of vision-based abstractions for planning in rearrangement, improving scalability and planning performance with potential real-world applicability.

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

*Sandra Q. Liu,Yuxiang Ma,Edward H. Adelson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The abstract reports using a GelSight Baby Fin Ray to capture high-resolution tactile data and apply learning to texture recognition and force/position estimation, comparing multiple CNN architectures (ResNet50, GoogLeNet, 3- and 5-layer CNNs) to assess information extraction from tactile images; results support ML as a promising tool for soft robotics to understand and interact with environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage rich tactile information from a high-resolution camera-based tactile sensor integrated with a soft Fin Ray hand, enabling tasks like texture discrimination, force/position estimation, and clutter navigation, thereby advancing perception and manipulation in soft robotics.

Method: Integration of GelSight Baby Fin Ray with a camera to capture tactile images while performing experiments on texture recognition and force/position estimation. Conducted ablation studies using multiple neural network architectures (ResNet50, GoogLeNet, 3-layer CNN, 5-layer CNN) to evaluate performance in interpreting tactile data.

Result: Demonstrates that machine learning can extract useful information from high-resolution tactile images, with ablation indicating the effectiveness of various CNN architectures for texture classification and force/position estimation, supporting improved perception in soft robotics.

Conclusion: Machine learning is a promising approach to extract meaningful signals from tactile data acquired by a high-resolution GelSight sensor, enabling soft robots to better perceive and interact with their environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

### [185] [Event-LAB: Towards Standardized Evaluation of Neuromorphic Localization Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14516)
*Adam D. Hines,Alejandro Fontan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Event-LAB is a unified framework that standardizes and simplifies running, comparing, and reproducing event-based localization methods across datasets by using Pixi for dependency management. It implements VPR and SLAM pipelines and provides analysis tools to reveal how generation parameters (event counts and window sizes) affect performance, enabling fair, systematic comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid growth in event-based localization research has led to a wide variety of code, dependencies, and data formats, making cross-method and cross-dataset comparisons difficult and unreliable. A unified, reproducible workflow is needed to fairily evaluate methodologies.

Method: Develop a framework (Event-LAB) built on Pixi to install and run multiple event-based localization methods on multiple datasets with a single command. Implement two pipelines (Visual Place Recognition and SLAM) to demonstrate the workflow. Provide visualization and analysis tools to study results and parameter effects under consistent event-image generation settings.

Result: Demonstrates that Event-LAB can systematically compare methods across datasets and reveals that event collection counts and frame-generation window sizes strongly influence performance. Shows the importance of consistent event image generation parameters for fair comparisons.

Conclusion: Event-LAB provides a streamlined, repeatable workflow for evaluating event-based localization methods across datasets, addressing reproducibility and fair comparison challenges in the field.

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

*Zhenghao Fei,Wenwu Lu,Linsheng Hou,Chen Peng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A teleoperated 4-DoF strawberry-picking robot uses an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to learn a fine-grained visuomotor policy for occluded picking, outperforming a baseline ACT approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion from plant leaves, stems, and fruit clusters makes reaching and grasping strawberries extremely challenging for perception-planning-control pipelines. Efficiently accessing the picking point at the stem above the calyx requires dexterous, delicate manipulation of surrounding soft objects.

Method: A 4-DoF SCARA arm with a human teleoperation interface is used for data collection. The system employs an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to learn a fine-grained visuomotor picking policy from human demonstrations.

Result: Experiments across various occlusion scenarios show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the direct (baseline) ACT implementation, indicating practical potential for occluded strawberry picking.

Conclusion: The demonstrated framework offers a promising path toward robust, demonstration-driven manipulation for occluded fruit-picking tasks and could be extended to real-world applications in field robotics.

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

*Haoran Xiao,Xue Wang,Huimin Lu,Zhiwen Zeng,Zirui Guo,Ziqi Ni,Yicong Ye,Wei Dai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical planning framework improves sampling efficiency and trajectory quality for automating vibratory sieve shaker operations in tight spaces, achieving large reductions in planning time and waypoints, and validated in physical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating complex laboratory manipulation in cramped environments (e.g., dual-arm lid manipulation with 3 cm clearance, bimanual handovers, obstructed container delivery) where conventional planners yield inefficient sampling and suboptimal paths; there is a need for smooth, constrained trajectories.

Method: A hierarchical framework combining Prior-Guided Path Planning (PGPP) with a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling in narrow passages, and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization (MSTO) to shorten, simplify, constrain joints, and apply B-spline smoothing; integrated to handle three challenging tasks.

Result: Planning time reduced by up to 80.4%; waypoints reduced by 89.4%; full vibratory sieve shaker operation completed in physical experiments, validating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, smooth, and constraint-aware automation for complex lab tasks in tight spaces, demonstrating effectiveness beyond conventional planning approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: New dataset SimCoachCorpus combining race-car simulator driving with professional coaching and unguided driving, capturing rich embodied and verbal interaction data to study motor skill learning and teaching dynamics; enables tasks like in-context learning, imitation learning, and topic modeling; public release after peer review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of datasets where language and physical action intertwine, especially for embodied skill acquisition via verbal instruction over time; provides naturalistic coaching interactions with multimodal signals.

Method: 29 participants (~90 min) in a simulator; 15 coached by pro coach, 14 unguided; data includes vehicle state/inputs, map boundaries, raceline, cone landmarks; synchronized with concurrent verbal coaching and end-of-lap feedback; annotations of coaching categories, compliance, cognitive load, emotional state.

Result: Dataset contains over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback utterances, over 40 hours of driving; demonstrates applications in in-context learning, imitation learning, topic modeling.

Conclusion: Dataset enables study of motor learning dynamics, linguistic phenomena, and teaching models; will be released publicly post peer-reviewed publication; early access registration available.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

*Takuya Kiyokawa,Tomoki Ishikura,Shingo Hamada,Genichiro Matsuda,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical, multi-objective optimization framework for planning disassembly with reconfigurable robots using two many-objective genetic algorithms plus constraint programming for scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disassembling constrained structures with adaptable robotic systems requires coordinating multiple arms and tools. The large search space leads to poor local optima, necessitating robust optimization and planning under constraints.

Method: A reconfigurable setup of multiple robot arms with diverse tools and a rotary stage. A hierarchical optimization pipeline uses two many-objective genetic algorithms for sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint programming for scheduling. A tailored chromosome initialization method mitigates local optima in the large sequence-planning search space.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method effectively solves complex reconfigurable robotic disassembly problems, producing plans that satisfy mandatory requirements and multiple preferences within realistic timeframes.

Conclusion: The integrated, multi-objective optimization approach enhances planning for reconfigurable robotic disassembly by addressing large search spaces and local optima, with demonstrated effectiveness in simulations.

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

*Anzhe Chen,Yifei Yang,Zhenjie Zhu,Kechun Xu,Zhongxiang Zhou,Rong Xiong,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes cross-embodiment pre-training for vision-language-action policies by enforcing embodiment-equivariant designs; introduces an action decoder and geometry-aware architecture to enable generalization to unseen robot configurations, with strong simulation and real-world results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action models generalize poorly to novel embodiments; emphasis on model size and data scale over action-space design leads to the configuration generalization problem that requires costly adaptation.

Method: Develop embodiment-equivariance theory for action space and policy design; build an action decoder that enforces configuration-equivariance; incorporate a geometry-aware network to enable embodiment-agnostic spatial reasoning; integrate these into a cross-embodiment pre-training framework.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings show improved pre-training effectiveness and more efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments.

Conclusion: Embedding embodiment-aware design into pre-training improves generalization across configurations and reduces adaptation cost; code for the approach is released.

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2 enhances BEV-based monocular VO with dense BEV flow supervision and PV-BEV fusion, preserving 6-DoF cues and achieving state-of-the-art performance, including a new public ZJH-VO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparse supervision and information loss in BEV-based VO due to perspective projection; enable robust 6-DoF motion understanding without extra annotations.

Method: Three-level supervision from pose data: dense BEV flow from 3-DoF ground truth; PV-BEV fusion computing correlation volumes before BEV projection to retain motion cues and scale; enhanced rotation sampling; three supervision targets: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF PV branch, final 3-DoF output.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with ~40x improvement in RTE over previous BEV methods; validated on KITTI, NCLT, Oxford; introduced ZJH-VO dataset with diverse scenarios; dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: Dense BEV supervision and PV-BEV fusion effectively mitigate supervision sparsity and information loss, enabling accurate BEV-based 3-DoF MVO from 6-DoF cues without extra annotations; broad dataset contribution facilitates future research.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

*Sibaek Lee,Jiung Yeon,Hyeonwoo Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Interpolation-free tri-plane lifting with volumetric fusion reduces 3D perception complexity by shifting nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, enabling real-time, embedded 3D perception with comparable accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D convolutions deliver high accuracy but are too computationally expensive for real-time robotics. Existing tri-plane methods depend on 2D features, interpolation, point queries, and MLPs, which are heavy and ill-suited for embedded 3D inference. A more efficient, parallelizable approach is needed for edge devices.

Method: Introduce interpolation-free tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion: directly project 3D voxels into plane features and reconstruct a feature volume via broadcast and summation. Move nonlinear computations to 2D convolutions. Add a low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a lightweight integration layer. The design is end-to-end GPU-accelerated and fully parallelizable.

Result: Across tasks (classification, completion, segmentation, detection), classification/completion retain or improve accuracy; segmentation/detection incur modest accuracy drops but gain significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano show robust real-time throughput, supporting embedded robotic perception.

Conclusion: The method offers a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for embedded 3D perception, enabling real-time operation on edge GPUs without sacrificing core performance for several tasks, and demonstrating practical viability for robotics.

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Conclusion: RealMirror unifies data, benchmarks, and sim-to-real capabilities into an open-source platform, lowering barriers and enabling rapid progress in humanoid VLA research.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between
simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive

models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: Integrates co-designed hardware and algorithms to advance contact-rich manipulation and makes resources available to the research community.

Abstract: Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection and

propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning

### [195] [Wohlhart's Three-Loop Mechanism: An Overconstrained and Shaky Linkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14698)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reevaluates a three-loop spatial linkage; finds DOF 3 (overconstrained) though the reference configuration has DOF 5; shows the configuration space is locally a smooth manifold so the reference is not a c-space singularity; differential DOF is locally constant, implying shakiness; uses kinematic tangent cone and local c-space approximation for higher-order analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the kinematic structure and singularity behavior of the three-loop spatial linkage studied in Wohlhart (ARK 2004) and Diez-Martinez et al. (ARK 2006), resolving questions about its DOF, configuration-space structure, and potential singularities.

Method: Perform a local differential analysis: compute the DOF in the vicinity of the reference configuration, assess whether the configuration space forms a smooth manifold, examine the behavior of the differential DOF, and apply higher-order tools such as the kinematic tangent cone and a local approximation of the c-space to capture the near-reference geometry.

Result: The linkage has a finite degree of freedom DOF of 3 (overconstrained) in the local analysis, while in the reference configuration the differential DOF is 5. The configuration space is locally a smooth manifold, so the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity. The differential DOF is locally constant, which makes this linkage shaky (the reference configuration is not a singularity). Higher-order analysis is facilitated by computing the kinematic tangent cone and a local approximation of the c-space.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of the linkage’s kinematic structure by confirming overconstrained DOF, ruling out a c-space singularity at the reference, and demonstrating shakiness via local constancy of the differential DOF; it also demonstrates a practical approach (tangent cones and local c-space approximations) for higher-order analysis of complex linkages.

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Motivation: Model-based controllers often rely on pre-computed reference trajectories and surrogate objectives; real-time, direct optimization of gate progress is desirable for time-optimal race performance; RL insights show surrogate objectives may diverge from the actual racing goal.

Method: Introduce gate-progress objective into MPPI; use sampling-based control to optimize a non-differentiable objective in real-time; establish a unified framework to compare three objectives (trajectory tracking, contouring, gate progress) under MPPI and a gradient-based solver, with identical dynamics and parameters; evaluate performance.

Result: Proposed method achieves competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods; demonstrates MPPI can optimize non-differentiable objective; provides video resources.

Conclusion: A reference-free MPPI approach with a gate-progress objective is viable for time-optimal drone racing, enabling fair comparison of objectives and potentially outperforming traditional, reference-dependent methods; MPPI's sampling-based optimization is well-suited for discontinuous objectives.

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

### [197] [Investigating the Effect of LED Signals and Emotional Displays in Human-Robot Shared Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14748)
*Maria Ibrahim,Alap Kshirsagar,Dorothea Koert,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Nonverbal cues via LED color signals and emotional facial displays boost perceived interactivity but do not improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or task efficiency beyond LED signals alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance safety and efficiency in HRI by evaluating nonverbal communication modalities (LED signals and emotional displays) in shared workspaces.

Method: Experimental study (n=18) with a Franka Emika Panda robot; LED strip on end-effector; animated facial display on tablet; three conditions (LED only, LED+reactive emotions, LED+pre-emptive emotions); data from questionnaires and position tracking; outcomes: anticipation of potential collisions, clarity of communication, task performance.

Result: Emotional displays increased perceived interactivity but did not significantly improve key performance metrics over LED signals alone.

Conclusion: Emotional cues may enhance engagement but limited impact on performance; prioritize LED signaling for safety/efficiency; consider UX trade-offs in design.

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

### [198] [Designing Latent Safety Filters using Pre-Trained Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14758)
*Ihab Tabbara,Yuxuan Yang,Ahmad Hamzeh,Maxwell Astafyev,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-based control safety hinges on safety filters built from pre-trained vision representations;study compares training strategies (scratch, fine-tune, freeze) across classifiers, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, and latent world models, evaluates PVRs' generality and decision components for switching to safe policies, and discusses deployment on resource-limited devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in vision-based control is challenging; safety filters from classical control have not been widely applied to vision-based systems; PVRs offer strong perception backbones but their effect on safety-filter modules is not well understood; need guidance on training strategies and practical deployment.

Method: Use pre-trained vision representations as backbones for (i) classifiers defining failure sets, (ii) Hamilton-Jacobi safety filters, and (iii) latent world models; compare training regimes (train from scratch, fine-tune, freeze); evaluate across tasks; compare different PVRs; evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions improve switching decisions to safe policies; discuss resource constraints for deployment.

Result: Expect findings of trade-offs: no single PVR dominates across all tasks; training strategy (freeze vs fine-tune) significantly affects performance; world models vs Q-functions yield different benefits for switching decisions; PVRs can improve safety filters but practical deployment needs careful selection per task and device constraints.

Conclusion: PVRs are viable backbones for vision-based safety filters, but ecosystem requires task- and device-aware choices; recommended guidelines for selecting PVRs and training strategies, and for deploying on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

*Qixuan Li,Chen Le,Dongyue Huang,Jincheng Yu,Xinlei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COMPASS is a multi-stage exploration/manipulation framework with a manipulation-aware planner that improves safe exploration and manipulation in cluttered, confined spaces, achieving 24.25% higher manipulation success in simulations and validating in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulation in confined, cluttered environments is hampered by partial observability and complex configuration spaces, requiring safe exploration to understand the scene and locate targets.

Method: Proposes COMPASS: a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework. Includes a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision map; a multi-objective utility function to select viewpoints that are informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation; and a constrained manipulation optimization to generate poses that respect obstacles. Evaluated on a four-level confined-space benchmark and compared to info-gain-only baselines.

Result: In simulations, manipulation success rate increases by 24.25% over baselines; real-world experiments demonstrate active sensing and manipulation in confined environments.

Conclusion: COMPASS effectively integrates exploration and manipulation planning for confined spaces, enabling safer, more informative sensing and successful manipulation, with strong validation in simulation and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

*Humphrey Munn,Brendan Tidd,Peter Böhm,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GCR-PPO decomposes actor updates into per-objective gradients via a multi-headed critic to address gradient conflicts in multi-objective RL for robotics, yielding better scalability and higher performance than PPO, especially with conflicting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward aggregation in robotics with many objectives leads to brittle optimization, tuning burden, and poor scalability; gradient conflicts between task rewards and regularization hinder learning; need scalable multi-objective RL methods.

Method: Introduce GCR-PPO: modify actor-critic optimization to separate objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic; resolve conflicts based on objective priority; evaluate on IsaacLab manipulation/locomotion benchmarks and other tasks; compare to parallel PPO.

Result: GCR-PPO shows superior scalability to parallel PPO (p=0.04) with little overhead; higher performance as objective conflict increases; average improvement ~9.5% over large-scale PPO; high-conflict tasks see greater gains.

Conclusion: Decomposing and prioritizing objective gradients with a multi-headed critic mitigates gradient conflicts in multi-objective RL for robotics, enabling scalable and more effective learning without heavy computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CollabVLA introduces a self-reflective vision-language-action framework that uses VLM-driven reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation and a mixture-of-experts to create a collaborative assistant. It enables explicit self-reflection, solicits human guidance when uncertain, and reduces latency and error compared to prior generative agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome core weaknesses of prior vision-language-action systems: domain overfitting, opaque reasoning, and high latency from auxiliary generative models; aims to produce interpretable, collaborative agents that can reason, act, and collaborate with humans.

Method: A two-stage training scheme (action grounding and reflection tuning) that integrates VLM-based reflective reasoning with diffusion-based action generation within a mixture-of-experts framework. The system performs explicit self-reflection and proactively asks for human guidance when facing uncertainty or repeated failures.

Result: Normalized task time is reduced by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x compared with generative agents; higher success rates; improved interpretability; balanced low latency relative to existing methods.

Conclusion: Marks a pioneering shift of VLAs from opaque controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating with humans.

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

*Shenghai Yuan,Jason Wai Hao Yee,Weixiang Guo,Zhongyuan Liu,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PERAL enables perception-aware motion control for spherical robots to passively excite LiDAR returns, improving near-ground sensing without extra hardware and reducing map gaps and tracking error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Horizontally mounted LiDARs capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior fixes (static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors) add hardware, cost, or power. A hardware-free, perception-aware solution is needed.

Method: Model the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude; superimpose bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands to enrich vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy; implemented on a compact spherical robot; validated in laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.

Result: Experiments show up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory-tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, with lower weight, power, and cost compared to static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines.

Conclusion: PERAL enables passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware, improving ground-level perception for navigation and mapping; code will be open-sourced upon acceptance; applicable across lab, corridor, and tactical environments.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A lean, modular Robot Control Stack (RCS) unifies simulation and real robots to streamline VLA/RL research, enabling large-scale training and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics software bottlenecks and limited sim-to-real transitions hinder progress for vision-language-action policies built on large-scale data; a lightweight, extensible stack aligned with ML workflows is needed.

Method: Design and present RCS architecture with layered modules and a unified API for both simulated and physical robots; evaluate usability and performance across VLA/RL development cycles, using Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots.

Result: RCS delivers a minimal-footprint yet full-featured stack that supports real-world experiments and large-scale simulation; empirical results show simulation data improves real-world policy performance and demonstrate broad cross-robot compatibility.

Conclusion: RCS bridges ML-centric training and robotics software, enabling scalable VLA/RL research with easy sim-to-real transfer; the ecosystem’s openness (code, data, weights, videos) fosters further development.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A CAD-driven co-design framework for jet-powered aerial humanoid robots that uses DoE to generate 5,000 designs, k-means clustering to reduce cost, minimum-jerk trajectories with a momentum-based linearized MPC, and NSGA-II to optimize design centroids and MPC gains, yielding flight-ready configurations with validated control parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the CAD, simulation, and control gap in designing jet-powered humanoids, enabling large design-space exploration under dynamic constraints while reducing computational cost through clustering.

Method: Generate 5,000 geometrically varied, mechanically feasible designs from iRonCub-Mk3 via DoE by varying limb dimensions, jet-interface geometry and mass distribution; construct CAD assemblies for each; cluster designs with K-means and select representative centroids; use minimum-jerk trajectories as references for MPC; perform NSGA-II multi-objective optimization over design centroids and MPC gains to minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy.

Result: A set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated control parameters, plus a Pareto front mapping trade-offs between tracking accuracy and energy expenditure; demonstrates a CAD-driven co-design workflow.

Conclusion: The framework provides a structured, end-to-end pipeline to co-design aerial humanoids—bridging design, dynamics, and control—while enabling efficient exploration of large design spaces and yielding ready-to-implement configurations.

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

*Hao Zhang,Zhen Kan,Weiwei Shang,Yongduan Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DART combines a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and LTL representations to improve learning efficiency and cross-category generalization in articulated dexterous manipulation, with an interaction-data-driven action refinement that outperforms many baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous manipulation of articulated objects and generalization across object categories remain challenging. Diffusion policies alone often require extensive data or fail to generalize well; there is a need for efficient learning and robust cross-category interaction strategies.

Method: Integrate linear temporal logic (LTL) for task semantics, affordance learning to identify optimal interaction points, and a diffusion-based policy that generalizes these interactions across categories. An optimization procedure using interaction data refines actions, addressing limitations of offline RL or purely demonstrated-based diffusion methods.

Result: Empirical experiments show that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation ability, generalization, transfer reasoning, and robustness across tested tasks.

Conclusion: DART is an effective framework for articulated dexterous manipulation, delivering improved learning efficiency and cross-category generalization, with practical benefits for robust manipulation in diverse settings.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

*Zongyuan Shen,Burhanuddin Shirose,Prasanna Sriganesh,Bhaskar Vundurthy,Howie Choset,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces Multi-CAP, a hierarchical, connectivity-aware planner that uses an online adjacency graph and VRP-based subarea assignment to coordinate multiple robots for efficient coverage of large unknown bounded environments, yielding lower coverage time, path length, and overlaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient multi-robot coverage in large, unknown but bounded environments requires coordinated planning to minimize total travel and avoid inter-robot conflicts; existing methods struggle with scalability and unknown areas.

Method: Build and dynamically maintain an adjacency graph that partitions the environment into connected subareas. The space is unknown but bounded, allowing online refinement as robots explore. Solve a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to assign subareas to robots, producing disjoint tours. Each robot follows its tour and locally adapts its coverage strategy within subareas based on real-time sensor data.

Result: In simulations and hardware experiments, Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies show the connectivity-aware graph and global tour planner are critical to these gains.

Conclusion: Connectivity-aware, online graph maintenance combined with VRP-based subarea allocation yields scalable, efficient multi-robot coverage in bounded unknown environments, with validated performance improvements.

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HICS-SLAM enables human-in-the-loop semantic SLAM via a shared XR environment for real-time collaboration, improving room detection, map precision, and semantic completeness over automated baselines on construction-site data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic SLAM struggles in real-world scenes with occlusions, incomplete data, and ambiguous geometries. Humans can inject high-level spatial and semantic knowledge to guide mapping, achieving better situational awareness.

Method: Introduce HICS-SLAM, a human-in-the-loop semantic SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality (XR) environment for real-time collaboration. Operators interact with and visualize the robot's 3D scene graph and add high-level semantic concepts (e.g., rooms, structural entities) into the mapping process. Propose a graph-based semantic fusion mechanism to integrate human interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world construction site datasets show improvements in room detection accuracy, map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of human-in-the-loop semantic SLAM with XR-enabled collaboration and highlights its potential for broader applications and future enhancements.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

TL;DR: A neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for texture classification identifies sliding+rotating as the optimal exploratory motion, achieving 87.33% accuracy at 8.04 mW using the NeuroTac sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic texture classification by mimicking human exploratory strategies and leveraging neuromorphic tactile data, while maintaining low power under variable real-world conditions.

Method: Evaluate six exploratory motions (sliding, rotating, tapping, and pairwise combinations) under fixed conditions to select best motions; then test the top motions under varying contact depth and speed to assess robustness and power.

Result: Sliding+rotating achieved the highest accuracy of 87.33% with low power consumption of 8.04 mW under varying contact depth and speeds; sliding alone also considered favorable, but sliding+rotating was optimal.

Conclusion: The sliding+rotating exploratory strategy is the optimal approach for neuromorphic tactile texture classification and holds promise for enhanced robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Result: Disambiguation rate of 60% on the dataset; demonstrates a safer human-robot interaction framework with an explicit uncertainty measure to identify ambiguous commands.

Conclusion: The framework advances safer HRI in the operating room by grounding verbal instructions in visual context and quantifying uncertainty; results suggest potential generalization to other procedures and avenues for future work with larger datasets and real-time deployment.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the
operating room.

### [210] [PA-MPPI: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Quadrotor Navigation in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14978)
*Yifan Zhai,Rudolf Reiter,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Perception-aware MPPI (PA-MPPI) augments Model Predictive Path Integral control with perception objectives to handle unknown, occluded environments. It biases trajectories toward perceivable regions, enabling exploration and improved robustness; hardware tests show large gains over baseline MPPI and potential as a safe policy for navigation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown, obstacle-rich environments create non-convex free space and occlusions. MPPI handles quadrotor dynamics but cannot explore unseen regions when blocked by obstacles, limiting success.

Method: Introduce a perception cost that guides online trajectory optimization to favor states with better perception of unknown regions. Dynamically adapt trajectories based on perception objectives, supported by an efficient perception and mapping module operating at 50 Hz.

Result: Hardware experiments show PA-MPPI performs up to 100% better than baseline MPPI in challenging scenarios where standard MPPI fails; it can also serve as a safe, robust action policy for navigation foundation models.

Conclusion: Incorporating perception-awareness into MPPI expands the effectively traversable space under uncertainty, improving path discovery and robustness for quadrotor navigation in unknown environments.

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

### [211] [M4Diffuser: Multi-View Diffusion Policy with Manipulability-Aware Control for Robust Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14980)
*Ju Dong,Lei Zhang,Liding Zhang,Yao Ling,Yu Fu,Kaixin Bai,Zoltán-Csaba Márton,Zhenshan Bing,Zhaopeng Chen,Alois Christian Knoll,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, multi-view policy paired with a manipulability-aware QP controller enables robust, whole-body mobile manipulation in unstructured environments, outperforming baselines in success and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view methods struggle in unstructured settings due to limited field of view, exploration gaps, and poor generalization; classical controllers are stable but inefficient near singularities and fail to exploit full manipulability. There is a need for coordinated perception and control that can handle both global context and fine-grained object details.

Method: Introduce M4Diffuser: a hybrid framework combining a Multi-View Diffusion Policy that fuses proprioception with multiple camera perspectives to generate world-frame end-effector goals, and a Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller that removes slack variables for efficiency and incorporates manipulability preferences to maintain robustness near singularities.

Result: In simulations and real-world experiments, M4Diffuser achieves 7–56% higher success rates and 3–31% fewer collisions compared with baselines, demonstrating smooth whole-body coordination and strong generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides robust mobile manipulation in unstructured environments and paves the way for reliable, generalizable coordination of base and arm with better efficiency and safety; further details are available on the project site.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

*João Damião Almeida,Egidio Falotico,Cecilia Laschi,José Santos-Victor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how tactile feedback from various hand regions (beyond fingertips) affects in-hand object reorientation with deep RL, investigating how sensor placement and object properties influence policy robustness and manipulation efficiency, to guide anthropomorphic end-effector design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond fingertip sensors, understand how distributed tactile sensing across fingers and palm impacts control robustness and performance in in-hand manipulation, and how object characteristics constrain optimal sensor placement.

Method: Evaluate tactile feedback from different hand regions during in-hand reorientation tasks within a deep RL framework; assess robustness and performance across sensor configurations; analyze relationship between object properties and optimal sensor placement; derive design insights.

Result: Identify tactile configurations that improve manipulation efficiency and accuracy; determine which regions contribute most to robustness; provide guidelines on sensor placement for improved dexterity in anthropomorphic grippers.

Conclusion: Distributed tactile sensing across multiple hand regions can enhance in-hand manipulation; informed sensor placement yields better control performance; results inform future design of tactile networks for robotic hands.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

### [213] [ExT: Towards Scalable Autonomous Excavation via Large-Scale Multi-Task Pretraining and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14992)
*Yifan Zhai,Lorenzo Terenzi,Patrick Frey,Diego Garcia Soto,Pascal Egli,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExT is a foundation-like framework for autonomous excavation: large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning (SFT or RLFT) to produce multitask policies that transfer from simulation to real machines and adapt rapidly to new tasks and configurations, achieving centimeter-level accuracy and competitive performance with specialized controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling autonomous excavation to real-world variability; current controllers are handcrafted and require extensive manual tuning per scenario; large pretrained models have shown adaptability in other domains, but heavy machinery remains underexplored.

Method: Collect large-scale demonstrations from experts; pretrain multitask excavation policies in a unified ExT framework; fine-tune with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to adapt to new tasks or operating conditions; evaluate in both simulation and real-world, demonstrating sim-to-real transfer and rapid adaptation to new machine configurations.

Result: Pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy and transfer from simulation to a real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers; fine-tuning pipelines enable rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations in simulation while preserving performance on previously learned tasks.

Conclusion: ExT demonstrates a scalable, generalizable approach for autonomous excavation, highlighting large-scale demonstration-based pretraining and fine-tuning as a foundation for adaptable, multitask heavy-machinery policies.

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

### [214] [Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry Fusion for Robust Localization in Large-Scale Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14999)
*Haoxuan Jiang,Peicong Qian,Yusen Xie,Linwei Zheng,Xiaocong Li,Ming Liu,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A semantic-voxel map based, tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel Odometry system with an improved scan-matching method and 3D adaptive wheel-odometry weighting, delivering drift-free, high-precision global localization in large-scale dynamic environments; validated in a 1M m^2 port with 3,575 hours across 35 IGVs, outperforming state-of-the-art LiDAR localization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global localization in large, dynamic environments is prone to long-term drift and failure, especially for autonomous systems relying on LiDAR/IMU/wheel data; there is a need for drift-free, robust localization that leverages semantic information and multi-sensor fusion in real-world, large-scale settings.

Method: Propose a tightly-coupled fusion framework that uses a semantic-voxel map and an enhanced scan-matching technique that exploits global semantic cues to reduce drift. Fuse LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry via a multi-sensor Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter (iESKF). Introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy to adjust wheel-odometry weights for varying terrain and dynamics, improving local accuracy.

Result: Extensive real-world evaluation in a one-million-square-meter automated port with 3,575 hours of data from 35 IGVs. The proposed system consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments, demonstrating reliability and practical value with reduced drift.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic information, adaptive wheel-odometry weighting, and tight LiDAR-IMU-wheel fusion yields robust, drift-free global localization for large-scale dynamic scenarios, validated by comprehensive real-world experiments.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

*Walker Gosrich,Saurav Agarwal,Kashish Garg,Siddharth Mayya,Matthew Malencia,Mark Yim,Vijay Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Network-flow based framework for multi-robot task allocation with task graphs, precedence constraints, and coalitions, plus an online iterative re-allocation method achieving robustness; validated against solvers and heuristics in both testbeds and simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses NP-hardness of maximizing task rewards under complex task precedence and cooperative constraints; seeks scalable, robust planning for real multi-robot systems.

Method: Formulates tasks and relationships as a graph with reward functions for coalition size and precedence; develops network-flow based approximations; introduces an online iterative re-allocation algorithm; evaluates against a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic in randomized missions and advanced simulation.

Result: Provided efficient, high-quality approximate solutions; online re-allocation improves robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies; outperforms offline approaches and baseline heuristics in both testbed and simulator evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models complex missions and produces high-fidelity task plans efficiently by exploiting task relationships and coalitions, enabling scalable and robust multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

### [216] [Ask-to-Clarify: Resolving Instruction Ambiguity through Multi-turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15061)
*Xingyao Lin,Xinghao Zhu,Tianyi Lu,Sicheng Xie,Hui Zhang,Xipeng Qiu,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces the Ask-to-Clarify framework to enable two-way interaction for embodied agents by asking clarifying questions before action, using a VLM for collaboration and a diffusion model for action, with a connection module to condition diffusion on clarified observations; trained in two stages and guided by a signal-detector router, achieving state-of-the-art results on 8 real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs often operate in a one-way mode, failing under ambiguous instructions in real-world settings. There is a need for interactive clarification to reliably execute tasks.

Method: A two-component architecture: a VLM for collaboration and a diffusion-based action model. A connection module conditions the diffusion based on VLM outputs. Training uses a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy: (1) fine-tune the collaboration component with ambiguity-resolving dialogue; (2) integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration component. Inference uses a signal detector to switch between asking clarifying questions and taking actions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 8 real-world tasks shows the framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs, supporting the viability of interactive clarification to enable collaborative embodied agents.

Conclusion: Clarifying questions can be integrated into the decision loop to improve reliability in embodied AI, and the proposed training and router mechanisms provide a practical path toward collaborative, interactive agents.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

### [217] [Energy-Constrained Navigation for Planetary Rovers under Hybrid RTG-Solar Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15062)
*Tianxin Hu,Weixiang Guo,Ruimeng Liu,Xinhang Xu,Rui Qian,Jinyu Chen,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An energy-constrained trajectory planning framework for ground rovers with hybrid RTG-solar power, integrating physics-based power models into SE(2) trajectory optimization to satisfy both energy budgets and instantaneous power limits, yielding power-feasible, smooth trajectories on lunar-like terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-duration planetary rovers will rely on hybrid power sources (RTG plus solar). Existing terrain planners often ignore power flow and instantaneous power limits, risking energy shortages or hardware stress. There is a need to explicitly model energy feasibility and constraints in ground rover planning.

Method: Develop an energy-constrained trajectory planning framework that combines translational, rotational, and resistive power models with baseline subsystem loads under a hybrid RTG-solar input. Integrate cumulative energy budgets and instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory optimization to produce trajectories that are smooth, dynamically feasible, and power-compliant.

Result: Simulation on lunar-like terrain shows the planner keeps peak power within 0.55% of the limit, while conventional methods exceed the limit by over 17%. This demonstrates effective energy-aware planning for long-duration missions.

Conclusion: A principled, practical approach to energy-aware autonomy for planetary rovers, ensuring trajectories respect both energy budgets and instantaneous power constraints without sacrificing smoothness or feasibility.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

*Yating Lin,Zixuan Huang,Fan Yang,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AnoF-Diff leverages diffusion-based feature extraction of force-torque time-series for robust multivariate anomaly detection, achieving superior F1 and AUROC and enabling online detection on four tool-use tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world forceful tool-use sensor data are noisy, non-stationary, and vary across tools/tasks; existing methods struggle with these challenges.

Method: Proposes AnoF-Diff: a diffusion-model-based pipeline that extracts force-torque features from time-series; uses these features for anomaly detection; introduces parallel anomaly score evaluation with one-step diffusion for online detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in F1-score and AUROC on four forceful tool-use tasks; demonstrates robustness to noise; shows viability of online anomaly detection.

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff provides a robust and effective approach for online anomaly detection in forceful tool-use data via diffusion-based feature extraction; potential for broader deployment.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

*Yitian Gao,Lucas Chen,Priyanka Bhovad,Sicheng Wang,Zachary Kingston,Laura H. Blumenschein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified modeling and optimization framework for vine robots that grow, bend, actuate, and contact obstacles, featuring an extended beam moment model, fast parallel simulation, and design optimization to minimize actuators by leveraging environmental contacts, with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft vine robots can safely operate in unstructured, dynamic environments, and active steering is required for complex navigation. Prior work emphasized planning under contact for passive, pre-formed bends; this work integrates growth, actuation, and contact to enable steering and design optimization in cluttered spaces.

Method: Extend the beam moment model to account for actuation during growth, develop a fast parallel simulation framework, validate the model with real robot experiments, and perform design optimization to identify vine-robot geometries that minimize actuator count by exploiting environmental contacts; assess robustness to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties and fabricate an optimized design for obstacle-rich deployment.

Result: The extended model and simulator align with experimental results; optimization yields designs that navigate clutter with fewer actuators and are robust to uncertainties; an optimized design is fabricated and successfully deployed in a cluttered environment.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified framework for planning under contact for actively steering vine robots, demonstrates the potential to reduce actuation through environmental interaction, and offers a practical path from modeling to optimized, robust, real-world deployment.

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.
